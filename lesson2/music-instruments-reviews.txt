{"source": "The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable"}
{"source": "I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived, so it was even better than I had expected"}
{"source": "As an added bonus, one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy, so for reminiscent's sake, I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording"}
{"source": " :DIf you needed a pop filter, this will work just as well as the expensive ones, and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]"}
{"source": "The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies"}
{"source": " The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration"}
{"source": " The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached"}
{"source": " The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it"}
{"source": "Monster makes a wide array of cables, including some that are very high end"}
{"source": " I initially purchased a pair ofMonster Rock Instrument Cable - 21 Feet - Angled to Straight 1/4-Inch plugto use with my keyboards, but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar I thought I'd pinch a few pennies"}
{"source": "  I am so glad I did"}
{"source": "I compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound"}
{"source": " I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference"}
{"source": "What the more expensive model has going for it is looks"}
{"source": " I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling"}
{"source": "Bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision"}
{"source": " You may find, as I did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer"}
{"source": "I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well"}
{"source": "  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend"}
{"source": "  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into"}
{"source": "  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables"}
{"source": "  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better"}
{"source": "  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable"}
{"source": "  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable"}
{"source": "  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well"}
{"source": "  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables"}
{"source": "  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it"}
{"source": "  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input"}
{"source": "  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab"}
{"source": "  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose"}
{"source": "Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues"}
{"source": "  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-"}
{"source": "The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made"}
{"source": "I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere"}
{"source": "I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly"}
{"source": "You really will not be disappointed with these"}
{"source": "Cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff"}
{"source": "  Only time will tell how well the soldering is"}
{"source": "  Sounds fine to me"}
{"source": "This Hosa Cable is very well made, with good quality connectors and a nice long length"}
{"source": " My son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected"}
{"source": " This 25' cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around"}
{"source": "The cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable"}
{"source": "Highly Recommended!CFH"}
{"source": "I didn't expect this cable to be so thin"}
{"source": " It's easily 1/2 the thickness of any guitar cable I've used"}
{"source": " Not sure about long-term durability or signal loss/interference"}
{"source": " If I had the foresight I'd spend a couple extra bucks on a thicker cable"}
{"source": "  Still, it works and was inexpensive"}
{"source": "EDIT: 6 months later and it's dead already"}
{"source": "  Wire frayed at the right angle jack"}
{"source": "  You get what you pay for"}
{"source": "This guitar cable is very nice"}
{"source": "  It looks high quality and has the white ends"}
{"source": "  Fantastic deal for this cable"}
{"source": "It's a cable, no frills, tangles pretty easy and due to it's design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should"}
{"source": "One end was loose, so I tightened it, it keeps coming loose so I had to put a dab of crazy glue on the threads, hope I don't ever have to open the end for repair"}
{"source": "For the price, fantastic"}
{"source": "They do feel light and I don't trust the build quality at the key stress points (where cable meets connector), but then again I am not going to push it"}
{"source": "Set your guitar down on it by accident when it's plugged in and"}
{"source": "who knows"}
{"source": "But for seven bucks it gets the job done"}
{"source": " Recommended if you are doing the \"beginner\" thing and testing the waters"}
{"source": "Otherwise, spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting"}
{"source": "I've been using these for about 3 weeks now - they are strong but flexible and don't seem to develop kinks or bending \"habits\" if you roll them up the proper way"}
{"source": "I've seen and used some better cables but not at this price point"}
{"source": "  And I've certainly seen quite a few worse!  This is a pretty good sweet spot, in my opinion"}
{"source": "Bought this to hook up a Beta 58 to a Panasonic G2 DSLR and a Kodak Zi8 for interviews"}
{"source": " Works the way it's supposed to"}
{"source": " 90 degree TRS is a nice touch"}
{"source": " Good price"}
{"source": "Just received this cord and it seems to work as expected"}
{"source": " What can you say about an adapter cord?  It is well made, good construction and sound from my DSLR with my mic is superb"}
{"source": "This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats"}
{"source": "First, it's construction is pretty light weight"}
{"source": " That means you will have to be \"gentle\" with it when using it"}
{"source": " That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up"}
{"source": "Second, the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it"}
{"source": " This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera"}
{"source": " That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter"}
{"source": "So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others"}
{"source": " I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable, heavy duty, and with a longer cable for the same price"}
{"source": " It pays to shop around!"}
{"source": "I play my I-pod through a small guitar Amp"}
{"source": "  Great way to wake up the kids"}
{"source": "  Works perfectly for the purpose"}
{"source": "  Keep in mind small end for I-Pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono"}
{"source": "  If needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else"}
{"source": "It's hard not to love a cord that carries electrons all the way to the end"}
{"source": " Not sure what, other than complete failure would take stars away"}
{"source": "These little patch cables work nicely, there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine"}
{"source": "I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5"}
{"source": " The product description says 6 inches, right? If you jump over to these (http://www"}
{"source": "amazon"}
{"source": "com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at "}
{"source": "5 feet (same as 6 inches, right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches, whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another"}
{"source": " I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up"}
{"source": "To conclude, would I recommend these? Yes, if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable, go for these"}
{"source": " But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else"}
{"source": "These are great patch cables especially for the price"}
{"source": " They don't suck any tone they are reliable(I've had mine for 2 years)and are really great for players on a budget"}
{"source": "This is not the fanciest cable you can buy, but it fits my low budget"}
{"source": "  It works perfectly, it doesn't feel like its going to break anytime soon, and my pedals are perfectly connected"}
{"source": "I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake, to change 1 channel into my monitor return"}
{"source": " I plug an XLR to Female 1/4\" stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup"}
{"source": " Now I can record with 6 channels, and monitor with 2"}
{"source": " (It's an 8 channel XLR snake)"}
{"source": " Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake, and instead of buying another snake, why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter"}
{"source": " :-P I love it"}
{"source": " It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup, no matter what you're doing"}
{"source": " Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4\" stereo"}
{"source": " It's high quality, and very solid, I definately expect this to last me a long time"}
{"source": "I got 3 of these to plug XLR cables into the 1/4&#34; jacks on my board"}
{"source": " I got it because my board only has 6 channels with XLR inputs"}
{"source": " None of them work"}
{"source": " Perhaps I got the wrong thing?"}
{"source": "As expected from Hosa another great product"}
{"source": "  Solid construction and great sound reproduced"}
{"source": "  i would recomed this product to everyone"}
{"source": "This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company"}
{"source": "  Andy said that this product is far superior to any other"}
{"source": "  He was right"}
{"source": "  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6"}
{"source": "0 amp"}
{"source": "  Also fixed the effects loop jacks, which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs"}
{"source": "  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing, both problems are resolved!  Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating, cleaning and coating effect on the components"}
{"source": "  Wow!  And no, Andy does not own stock in, have affiliation with, or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit"}
{"source": "  Nor do I"}
{"source": "This thing is like a magic Spray! Hah!Seriously"}
{"source": " I used this on noisy hinges, car doors, etc"}
{"source": "I really bought it to clean the POTs (volume controls and knobs) on my Guitars, pedals and equipment"}
{"source": " It really does work and gets rid of the static noise you get when you turn your volume control on your radio or guitar for example"}
{"source": "I bought this product to use on my amp pots"}
{"source": " It restored the sound,power and clearity of my amps"}
{"source": "It doesn't evaporate right away, but after a couple of minutes your good to go!"}
{"source": "Back in the 1980's I bought a can of deoxit(not the right name but can't remember it) which worked much better and cost much less"}
{"source": " It was made for the military"}
{"source": " The spray has 3 levels but the low is still way to high"}
{"source": " It does work but the stuff I used to have was much better"}
{"source": " I don't see much else out there so I may have to stick with it"}
{"source": "It is just very wasteful for the cost"}
{"source": " I have had good luck with wd40 too, but it is very flammable"}
{"source": " I would call it average"}
{"source": "Before you pay some tech to fix the knobs and switches on your guitar, stomp box or amp, try this"}
{"source": "  95% of the time, this will take care of the problem"}
{"source": "  If your amp cuts in and out, also try spraying the effects loop and pushing a 1/4&#34; jack in and out of the socket a dozen times"}
{"source": "  The very first can I bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over"}
{"source": "  Good stuff !"}
{"source": "I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars, basses, amps, FX, MIDI gear, etc"}
{"source": "  Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy / noisy pots (knobs), input and output jacks that are crackly, etc"}
{"source": "In the past I've tried some Locktite electronics cleaner, which is provided in a similar can"}
{"source": " It would rarely work"}
{"source": "In contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear I've used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks"}
{"source": " It's really like magic in a can"}
{"source": "Fantastic stuff"}
{"source": "I sprayed it in my bass guitar's pot and now its like new"}
{"source": " Wish I had found this stuff sooner"}
{"source": "i was truly surprised when i saw how nice it was, has weight to it ,and has good sound , looks nicely made,very good deal for the money,,can't go wrong,, (not a very cheep made microphone ,, MUCH BETTER THEN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ! ) its nice,"}
{"source": "As a freelancer, I occasionally work with a band that plays the Midwest, performing on a near-weekly basis"}
{"source": "  These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet"}
{"source": "  It's all about money to them"}
{"source": "  I couldn't believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57's and 58's"}
{"source": "  I still don't believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much)"}
{"source": "  But these Nady's handle the announcing, the vocals, and, when needed, the softer sounding instruments (flute, harmonica), and none has broken or quit on my watch"}
{"source": "I'm a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don't affect me"}
{"source": "  I'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important \"gear component"}
{"source": "\"  At the same time, my embarrassment, I confess, is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee"}
{"source": "  After all, who's playing--and getting paid for it?"}
{"source": "We bought this mic after seeing how our grandson was handling the mic that came with the karaoke machine thinking that mic would not last very long"}
{"source": "  I hope it does because this nady sp-4c is a very impressive mic for the price"}
{"source": "  We our using it with our Roland cm30 cube and plan to use it with a Roland micro cube also"}
{"source": "  I would have given it 5 stars if the cord connection to the mic was not a little loose"}
{"source": "I bought this cable for my band's live show setup"}
{"source": "  I bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application"}
{"source": "  While not the best quality cable, the length and price make it a good value for the money, especially if you're buying several at a time"}
{"source": "  I don't use these cables in the studio but for live, they're fine"}
{"source": "  I'd recommend this cable if you're on a budget and looking to buy several at a time"}
{"source": "  If you're only going to buy one, I'd look into Canare or Mogami, they're a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price"}
{"source": "I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage"}
{"source": " It works for that"}
{"source": " It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability"}
{"source": " I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": ", running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics"}
{"source": "The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first"}
{"source": " I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell"}
{"source": " Not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months"}
{"source": "They're cheap and they work fine"}
{"source": " I haven't noticed any sound issues at all"}
{"source": "The Gain on this mic isn't the greatest, but for speeches and soft recordings: this guy can handle it all very well!"}
{"source": "So far, I'm very happy with this Microphone"}
{"source": " Tone quality is fine and does everything I need it to do for backup vocals in my band"}
{"source": " Although a longer cable would be nice, it's great a cable and was included in the package"}
{"source": "This microphone is great for singing with a PA and an electric guitar"}
{"source": " I sing worship/praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely"}
{"source": " I don't think it is the same as an SM58 but it is exactly what I need"}
{"source": " Built to last and it is a Shure"}
{"source": "Just got this, have used it for recording and rehearsal, it works well so far and I will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years"}
{"source": "  Right now, though, I'd say great product"}
{"source": "I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900"}
{"source": " It's a big step up from that one"}
{"source": " I am pleased with it"}
{"source": " The old one had a lot of handling noise"}
{"source": " This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it"}
{"source": " My next one will be an SM58, but that will be awhile from now"}
{"source": " I'm very happy with this PG58"}
{"source": "Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider"}
{"source": " It would keep me from buying another one of these"}
{"source": " Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree"}
{"source": "I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58"}
{"source": "  I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks"}
{"source": "  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58"}
{"source": "  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and \"clean\" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another"}
{"source": "  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P"}
{"source": "A"}
{"source": " that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58"}
{"source": "  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements)"}
{"source": "P"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": " I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58"}
{"source": "  Since the rise of the \"digital audio workstation\" (who doesn't have a computer with free, included Garage Band on it?), large, even gold-plated, expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place"}
{"source": "  Despite appearances, when it comes to mics, size doesn't matter--except for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half-way around the face, knowing that the girls in the front-line think they're cool--they look just like Madonna'a or Janet's headgear)"}
{"source": " Some of the best mics are tiny, with an opening the size of a pin-hole"}
{"source": "good mic for simple live stuff that isn't too expensive"}
{"source": "  it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things"}
{"source": "Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a \"Shure Model 545 Unidyne III"}
{"source": "\"  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function"}
{"source": "  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers"}
{"source": "  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57"}
{"source": "  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away"}
{"source": "  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive"}
{"source": "  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's"}
{"source": "  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end"}
{"source": "  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled"}
{"source": "  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used"}
{"source": "  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58"}
{"source": "  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it"}
{"source": "  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57"}
{"source": "  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one"}
{"source": "  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days"}
{"source": "  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere"}
{"source": "  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability"}
{"source": " For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes"}
{"source": "  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like"}
{"source": "  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable"}
{"source": "  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen"}
{"source": "Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard, which by all other instrument microphones are judged"}
{"source": "No kidding"}
{"source": "  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound, drums, congas, tablas"}
{"source": " You name it"}
{"source": "  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers"}
{"source": "I hear it's good for vocals as well"}
{"source": "  When the President gives a speech, the SM57 is there"}
{"source": "In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57"}
{"source": "  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's)"}
{"source": "For instrument sound reinforcement"}
{"source": "  bar-none"}
{"source": " the best"}
{"source": "I use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets"}
{"source": " It works as well as most mics and is more durable than most"}
{"source": " I have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine"}
{"source": " As long as I run sound for a living I will keep some of these mics"}
{"source": "Considering that the SM57 was introduced to the world in 1967, a year after the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone, I guess the 58 gets Batman status, relegating the 57 to that of Robin"}
{"source": " But that's not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time, and except for the 58's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen, the two mics are identical electrically"}
{"source": "The SM (Studio Microphone) 57 was designed to begin it's life in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers, drum kits, etc"}
{"source": " In that capacity, it had no use for the pop screen of it's cousin the SM58, still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day"}
{"source": " So the SM57 slimmed down and even though it's still a fine vocal mic, you'll see it used mostly mic'ing instruments, which it excels at"}
{"source": "One of it's long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the White House"}
{"source": " A pair of SM57's is always seen on various White House podiums for press conferences and there is even a VIP bundled kitShure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kityou can buy for this exact type of use"}
{"source": "The SM57 is an extremely rugged mic, built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse"}
{"source": " That's one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies"}
{"source": " And on top of that, it's just a great sounding mic for the price"}
{"source": "There is a Performer SeriesShure Beta 57A Microphonethat looks very similar to the SM57 but the Beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different"}
{"source": " So make sure you try before you buy"}
{"source": "Bottom line is the Shure SM57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced"}
{"source": " A best value for sound companies, home studio recordists and touring musicians"}
{"source": "It is not a bad mic for the price ( If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio"}
{"source": " Now, you need to decide what you want, getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for; it is like having HD TV and BD player but playing an ordinary CD"}
{"source": " You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer, speakers and so on"}
{"source": " If you are a home or hobby user, then go for this mic"}
{"source": " This mic is quite good for its price"}
{"source": " I would probably say, it exceeds your expectations"}
{"source": "Arrived as promised in a frustration free packing"}
{"source": " Also, make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit"}
{"source": "The only reason I did not give 5 stars is , mine had a little dent on the body ( may be due to transportation) but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks"}
{"source": "How do you review an SM58?? I've used these most of my life, and will continue to"}
{"source": " Very durable, I got this to replace the same, a 20 year old, rusted / dented grill 58 :) I also use a D5 (AKG - same price) and a line 6 wirelesss, but the 58 is always reliable first choice or backup"}
{"source": "The first rule of microphones is that, \"No one microphone is perfect for every purpose"}
{"source": "\"  Rule two is, \"Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound"}
{"source": "\"  I've used Shure SM58's along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968"}
{"source": "  I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals"}
{"source": "The SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use"}
{"source": "  Some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the Shure SM-57"}
{"source": "  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice"}
{"source": "  For example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58"}
{"source": "  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58"}
{"source": "The SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get"}
{"source": ")  This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away"}
{"source": "  The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don't sound right"}
{"source": "  On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away"}
{"source": "  While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic, there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly"}
{"source": "  It works ok for conga drums and the like, but the SM-58 is about the last thing you'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar"}
{"source": "  Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great"}
{"source": "  The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen"}
{"source": "  However for other people the SM-58 works better"}
{"source": "  It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do"}
{"source": "  If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response"}
{"source": "One certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability"}
{"source": "  This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal"}
{"source": "  Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on/off switch"}
{"source": "  The SM-58's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars"}
{"source": "  I've seen SM-58's dented, rusty, dusty, smoked up, spit into, with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it"}
{"source": "All the pro-line Shure mics are top quality"}
{"source": "  The pro line Shures also hold their value well"}
{"source": "  If you buy one and decide you don't like it, you can get about what you paid for it on eBay"}
{"source": "  I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one"}
{"source": "  Senneheiser's EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look"}
{"source": " The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice"}
{"source": "  These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they'd still be around for another 20 years at least"}
{"source": "I've just got the Shure SM58 microphone"}
{"source": "As expected, this is a real workhorse of microphones; the sound is clear, crispy, robust, high quality product"}
{"source": "Also, I've bought it at Amazon and they sold through J&R; Music and Computer World which is an excellent supplier"}
{"source": " They shipped in less time than expected"}
{"source": "I'm a really happy customer now"}
{"source": "no complaints here! the quality is great! the sounds is excellent! and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp"}
{"source": " use it all the time"}
{"source": "In the immortal words that John Cameron Swayze used when hawking his Timex watches during the early days of live television, the Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category"}
{"source": "Before I found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer, I played in rock bands and did live sound mixing"}
{"source": " One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58"}
{"source": " Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966, the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible"}
{"source": "The mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side"}
{"source": " There is a 4K bump in it's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise"}
{"source": " Construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise"}
{"source": "We used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn't find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough"}
{"source": " I've seen some of these on the road that you couldn't believe still worked, but they did and sounded great"}
{"source": "The cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it's distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it's part of the functionality"}
{"source": " Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element"}
{"source": " As a frame of reference, theShure SM57LC Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule, but without the pop screen"}
{"source": "Shure also sells a Performer series mic, theShure Beta 58A Supercardioid Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical to the SM58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy"}
{"source": "The Shure SM58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price, they really are a good deal"}
{"source": "I made the mistake of thinking I could save forty bucks and get by with the Shure PG-58"}
{"source": "  I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P"}
{"source": "A"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": " Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4\" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic)"}
{"source": "  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world"}
{"source": "  For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch"}
{"source": "  It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of \"private\" comments by indiscreet band members"}
{"source": "  And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57"}
{"source": "  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds"}
{"source": " Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability"}
{"source": "[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of \"this seller"}
{"source": "\"  Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns"}

{"source": "  They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility"}
{"source": "  In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators"}

{"source": "This is a well made, low noise and low cost cable"}
{"source": " Unless you make a lot of money with your recordings, this will do just fine!"}
{"source": "Everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another"}
{"source": "  I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately that design isn't used here, but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15' of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1/ft"}
{"source": "As for pinout it's straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends"}
{"source": "  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises"}
{"source": "Another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal"}
{"source": "  Having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix"}
{"source": "Back to pyle's product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot"}
{"source": "  It's also great when someone yells \"it's too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium!\" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn't planned for or got moved/quit working"}
{"source": "  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing"}
{"source": "I finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards"}
{"source": "  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit"}
{"source": " With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2"}
{"source": "5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin"}
{"source": "  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of \"what if\" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic"}
{"source": "My last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made"}
{"source": "  It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem"}
{"source": "  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position"}
{"source": "  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn't serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry"}
{"source": "  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console"}
{"source": "Not much to say other than it's a good cable"}
{"source": " Good solid connections with no play"}
{"source": " After consistent use, it's going strong"}
{"source": "No complaints, it's quiet enough and the price is right"}
{"source": " Is it a Monster cable? No, but it doesn't cost as much either"}
{"source": " I've used this on lead vocal tracks into a studio condensor mic for professional album sessions and it was fine"}
{"source": "Pros:* They look very nice"}
{"source": "* They cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers"}
{"source": "Cons:* More expensive and I had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship"}
{"source": "I'd purchase these again, but I now have 25 but only need 16 at the most once my rack is filled"}
{"source": "Why drive a Pinto when you can drive a Cadillac? This is the industries best mic as far as I am concerned"}
{"source": " I had a Shure SM 58 like everyone else owned but there is no comparison between this mic and a SM58"}
{"source": " SM 58 is garbage compared to the Beta 58A"}
{"source": " Spring for the extra bucks and be happy"}
{"source": " That's what I always say"}
{"source": "Yes, it costs considerably more than the SM58 and I'm not sure if I could pass a comparison test between the two, but I love this mic!  To me, it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the 58s I have used in the past"}
{"source": "  If you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet, get the 58"}
{"source": "  If you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost, go for the Beta"}
{"source": "  I would buy this again"}
{"source": "I'm an amateur sound tech"}
{"source": " We've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before"}
{"source": " Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews"}
{"source": " When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah"}
{"source": " For me, it sounded better than SM58"}
{"source": " My songleaders have tested it and guess what"}
{"source": " they dont want to use the SM58 anymore :)"}
{"source": "While the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals, and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship, the Beta 58A needs to be given its due"}
{"source": " The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin"}
{"source": " That is, the Beta 58A, in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues"}
{"source": " For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the Beta is a dream"}
{"source": " This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or \"popping\" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it"}
{"source": "While I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment"}
{"source": " Quite honestly, I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations"}
{"source": " The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the SM58, but it is worth every penny"}
{"source": " Anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority"}
{"source": " Six out of five stars!"}
{"source": "I actually replaced a BOSS TR2 with this pedal"}
{"source": " Does everything it is supposed to do without the \"perceived\" (that's was they say) volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals"}
{"source": " If it's perceived, then how do you explain how good this sounds? I have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because I was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off"}
{"source": "Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Dano stomp boxes"}
{"source": "  I probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make"}
{"source": "  This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs, but IMHO the tremolo from Dano's Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more (at the time of this review)"}
{"source": "  The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link"}
{"source": "  I don't think it's true bypass either"}
{"source": "  The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure, true bypass, sturdier inputs and knobs, and a much better on/off switch"}
{"source": "  The features and sound are the same"}
{"source": "  Spend the extra $4 and you will have a much more bullet-proof pedal with the Cool Cat trem"}
{"source": "Hey, it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for"}
{"source": "  I tried several \"cheapo\" pedals, and this one was my favorite of them all"}
{"source": "  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic), at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound, not a pretty pedal board"}
{"source": "  The pedal seems solid enough, it doesn't take up much space, it sounds great, and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come"}
{"source": "AND, if you are like the typical musician, you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank"}
{"source": "Hello Musicfriends - This is built cheap but sounds great"}
{"source": " Good controls too"}
{"source": " For me in the studio/songwriting  its perfect but I would not exactly go on tour with it"}
{"source": " There is something about the knobs I still love, even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it"}
{"source": " may be  the age thing"}
{"source": "The title says it all"}
{"source": "  I got it for $16 (free shipping with Amazon Prime), which is cheaper than my local music store"}
{"source": "  I keep it on the head of the guitar, and it is easy to add, move, remove"}
{"source": "  With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used"}
{"source": "  It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum)"}
{"source": "  And best of all"}
{"source": " it works!"}
{"source": "I like it, it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar"}
{"source": " And it looks good"}
{"source": " Overall, I recommend"}
{"source": "Quick to clip on and off"}
{"source": " Really"}
{"source": " Is there anything else to say? What else do you want it to do?These suckers are wonderfully reliable"}
{"source": "I've had one for about 10 years"}
{"source": " The only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the \"bottom\" of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect"}
{"source": " However, for a $1, keyser sent me a bag of a about 6 of them"}
{"source": " Can you go wrong? NO!Great product!"}
{"source": "Like this camo capo's simplicity and its unique color"}
{"source": "  My friend got a new one after seeing me using it, but his is a bit shorter than mine"}
{"source": "  Mine works both uke & acoustic guitar, I have no problem to use it on single hand"}
{"source": "  As the manufactor suggests for its duration, I don't clip it on the guitar when it's not in use"}
{"source": " :)"}
{"source": "Purchased the 6-string Kyser capo when I meant to get the 12-string version (slightly longer, stronger spring?), but find that this 6-string Capo not only works great on my 2 6-string acoustics, but also works on my 12-string acoustic with a little adjusting"}
{"source": "  Quality seems top notch, design is simple and effective"}
{"source": "I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one"}
{"source": "  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine"}
{"source": "  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years"}
{"source": "Very highly recommended!"}
{"source": "I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos"}
{"source": "  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses"}
{"source": "The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across, doesn't require tension adjustment, and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use"}
{"source": "  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second, it's smaller)"}
{"source": "The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension"}
{"source": "  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard, it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets, causing frets to wear faster over time"}
{"source": "  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby"}
{"source": "I've played guitar for 5 years"}
{"source": " Seen many different capos, but none that quite satisfies me as the Kyser"}
{"source": "You really can't go wrong with this capo"}
{"source": " It is very mobile, easily adjustable, sturdy, and durable"}
{"source": "What's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo"}
{"source": " The transparent rubber piece does the same job"}
{"source": "It comes in different colors also"}
{"source": "I own the black, silver, gold, and camo Kyser capos"}
{"source": "I also own the Cut Capo for other styles"}
{"source": "I recommend it!All the capos I've had from Kyser are still in great conditions"}
{"source": "Use them all the time at church and at home"}
{"source": "I started using Kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since"}
{"source": " I now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them"}
{"source": " They work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children I teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times"}
{"source": " Great capos"}
{"source": " You won't be disappointed"}
{"source": "I originally bought this for my guitar and it worked very well for that, so I tried it out on my 4 string uke and it works just as great"}
{"source": " It's so much better than the elastic capos"}
{"source": " So, it's doing double duty and going strong"}
{"source": "I can only repeat what everyone else has already said: this Kyser capo is designed and built very well"}
{"source": " It's easy to put on and adjust, and just as easy to take off"}
{"source": " There are probably a few capos out there that are a bit flashier, but this is still pretty stylish"}
{"source": " And the price makes it a real bargain"}
{"source": "I use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome"}
{"source": " I like to put the capo on the first fret and when I play a song I made, it sounds really really good"}
{"source": " The capo is very easy to use as well"}
{"source": "These Martin strings (M170) aren't bad"}
{"source": " They just are not the sound I was looking for"}
{"source": " I ended up like the Ernie Ball Earthwood extra light instead"}
{"source": " The Martin's are little shallow on the low end unlike the Ernie Ball"}
{"source": " Other people will love them though"}
{"source": " They are easy to play"}
{"source": "Martin makes great sounding strings"}
{"source": "  I decided to use Light Martin strings ("}
{"source": "12) because they sounded louder and better, and I could play them just as easy as the lighter strings"}
{"source": "I ordered a couple sets of this strings so I would have some extras for myself and my 6 year old son who is just starting out on guitar"}
{"source": " this strings have good sound and hold a tune well"}
{"source": " the best thing is the price is great"}
{"source": " Like I said I am usinging these on mine and my sons guitar and my son was breaking string from playing to hard, but with these string it does not break the bank to replace them as needed"}
{"source": "I love these strings, and use them for all of my acoustic playing"}
{"source": " Best of all, I can find them here for $3"}
{"source": "49 per set, so I'm not dumping a bunch of money on strings all the time"}
{"source": " Easy to play, and they sound great"}
{"source": "long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time"}
{"source": "these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven I use them all the time"}
{"source": "Good strings with good sound"}
{"source": "The Extra Light is easier on the fingers - but they sound thinner too"}
{"source": "Go for the Light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure"}
{"source": "This is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months, the sounds are rich and full, and the feels are still good"}
{"source": "  I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing, and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time"}
{"source": "  So, I want to keep a completed pack for back up"}
{"source": "  I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently, sometime, i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session"}
{"source": "  I have used light steel strings on my acoustic, but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter"}
{"source": "I am yet another one of those \"Forever Beginners\" when it comes to playing the guitar"}
{"source": " Never mind that"}
{"source": "these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better! After putting in new pegs and re-stringing with these strings"}
{"source": "it sounds so much nicer! More richer! Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose"}
{"source": " I think that once I do this and then re-string these same strings on it"}
{"source": "I will be set to go!I like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years"}
{"source": "let's face it"}
{"source": "my fingers get sore when playing! I also have small fingers and hands"}
{"source": "I intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use"}
{"source": "I recommend!"}
{"source": "Great,great sound"}
{"source": " The sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get"}
{"source": " They also teach a guitar player to use a lighter touch while playing to produce beautiful sounds"}
{"source": " Well worth it"}
{"source": "I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can't play with a pick in your strings"}
{"source": " I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock"}
{"source": " Boy was I wrong"}
{"source": " The picture is misleading"}
{"source": "  This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string"}
{"source": " It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks (maybe more if they are thin) into the wedges on top"}
{"source": " Stays in place well and is very convenient"}
{"source": "Only negative is I don't know how long it will hold up"}
{"source": " I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better"}
{"source": " I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks"}
{"source": "it's good but think its a bit expensive for just one they should give you two for that price or lower the price"}
{"source": "I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar"}
{"source": " After doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, I chose this one"}
{"source": "It's much easier to play than the Squier, and it has a better sound"}
{"source": " Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings"}
{"source": " I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it"}
{"source": "It's also a good choice for women"}
{"source": " I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller"}
{"source": " It's also fairly lightweight"}
{"source": "Overall, I'm happy with my choice"}
{"source": " A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500"}
{"source": " Maybe"}
{"source": " I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again"}
{"source": "I bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and I couldn't be happier"}
{"source": "  This was my first electric and after over a year of owning it, I got a way more expensive Fender Strat and I still prefer how this Epiphone feels; it is really lightweight, a lot more that even other Les Pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars I have tried, this makes it VERY easy to play, it stays in tune and it looks really REALLY lovely"}
{"source": "I like it so much, that I decided to add a pair of Slash's Alnico IIs on it, that cost more than the guitar itself, this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain, good ol' crunchy-bluessy rock"}
{"source": "Call me cheap if you want and I wouldn't care, this is one of those items that makes you wonder, how come there's others way more overpriced and just don't find a way to justify that a \"real\" Gibson Les Paul will sound $800 - $1000 better"}
{"source": "It wasn't until recently (after 3 years - I estimate somewhere around 1000 hours of heavy use) that it started fretting and that's why I gave it only 4 stars; but what would you expect from a $200 guitar"}

{"source": "  If you're learning, looking for a first electric or just want a \"practice\" axe that will not dissapoint you, just go ahead and buy it, don't give it a 2nd thought and do it"}
{"source": "I have been playing guitar since I was 6 years old (over 3 decades) and I must say this was a very pleasant surprise"}
{"source": "  I haven't had an electric in years, and didn't have the budget to get a Gibson, so picked up this Epi Les Paul 100 instead, along with a Fender Mustang I Amp"}
{"source": "  Great combination"}
{"source": "  This guitar has a very sloid feel, and came set-up perfectly right out of the box"}
{"source": "  All it needed was tuning"}
{"source": "  Unlike others, I didn't feel that the strings I got needed to be changed right away, but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them"}
{"source": "  Replaced mine with Ernie Ball \"Not Even Slinky's\" and couldn't be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds"}
{"source": "  Great sustain, beautiful harmonics, the clean tones are warm, can get nice blues tones out of it, and superb thrash metal too"}
{"source": "  Very versatile"}
{"source": "  It does not quiet do country or jazz, but it wasn't really meant to"}
{"source": "The action is extremely easy, fret board has a great feel to it, good width on the neck, not too slinder but not too thick"}
{"source": "  It just feels good in your hands"}
{"source": "The finish on this product is very nice"}
{"source": "  One thing though, the pick guard is kind of a tan / cream off white color, not bright white as pictured, but it still looks great"}
{"source": "Also, not mentioned in the description, but this does come with a 12 foot cord, but it's not the best quality"}
{"source": "  Would recommend picking up a new one when you order"}
{"source": "Overall, this is well worth the $500 that they list as the MSRP"}
{"source": "  At less than half that its a steal"}
{"source": "If you are considering this instrument, don't hesitate"}
{"source": "Well, the Epiphone Les Paul came in earlier this morning!Am I impressed? U bet cha!This thing is simply beautiful! It arrived well padded in a double box"}
{"source": " Initially, I spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if I could spot any flaws"}
{"source": " NONE! Not a finger print on it anywhere! This guitar is extremely well made and put together right"}
{"source": " It was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter"}
{"source": " The neck is slim (which is good for my thick hands) and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities"}
{"source": " I put a quarter under the 10th"}
{"source": " fret and it's right on the &#34;money&#34;!It's considerably heaver than than I thought"}
{"source": "  I would imagine it weighs about 10-14lbs"}
{"source": " I have a strap ordered and on the way"}
{"source": "The maple top is a work of art with a superior finish"}
{"source": " All the metal hardware appears top quality as are the Duncan pickups"}
{"source": " This Epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing I ever had"}
{"source": "  Your hand floats over the frets!I don't think you could get a better piece for the price point"}
{"source": "this is a beautiful guitar"}
{"source": "the finish is amazing"}
{"source": "and the tone is very clear"}
{"source": "if you can't afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul"}
{"source": "this is a fun and very good guitar for the money"}
{"source": "has 6 strings,,,from e to e"}
{"source": "and if you know the g chord you will have lot's of fun"}

{"source": "Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, EbonyHello again"}
{"source": " I have written a review on this guitar just after I purchased it and now it's been over a year and I still stand by my positive review"}
{"source": " I own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites"}
{"source": " My other favorite is a Dean electric 12 string"}
{"source": "  When I hold and play this Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something I could take on stage but it doesn't have the cost associated with a Gibson"}
{"source": " What's also amazing is that it's still around a $150"}
{"source": " It's well worth the noney"}
{"source": " It stays in tune and it high quality"}
{"source": " Well worth the money"}
{"source": " I just purchased an electric/acoustic Epiphone ukelele today for my Chiropractor"}
{"source": " I will review that later"}
{"source": " If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one"}
{"source": " Not his typical style although Amazon does sell one for about $250 so don't let the name fool you"}
{"source": " It's still a very nice guitar though"}
{"source": " Very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this guitar"}
{"source": " Buy it!  Thank you"}
{"source": "I've been playing for over 40 years"}
{"source": " I currently own 60 or so guitars"}
{"source": " My problem with LP's is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck, I've bought and sold quite a few"}
{"source": " Another problem with real LP's, you only get one chance to drop one, just see how many used ones have head-stock repairs"}
{"source": " They ARE beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play"}
{"source": " I deal in used guitars, picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap"}
{"source": " I didn't mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale"}
{"source": " I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars, even a lot of higher end guitars need it"}
{"source": " I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done (Chinese version from 2011) and only needed a slight leveling (would have played fine without it but I am very picky)"}
{"source": " It didn't take much to get it set up, small truss rod adjustment, new set of 10's for strings"}
{"source": " little bit of adjustment to the bridge, cut the nut a bit"}
{"source": "note it played well the way I got it, just like my stuff perfect"}
{"source": " Got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and that's when I started to really become impressed with this guitar"}
{"source": " Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character, these sounded pretty good, actually very good, nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end"}
{"source": " I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks"}
{"source": " It cut through really well"}
{"source": " I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didn't lose any highs when turned down"}
{"source": " The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep, very nice"}
{"source": " I popped off the back cover to check what was in there, full sized pots, maybe not the best quality but much better than expected"}
{"source": " I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix what's not broken"}
{"source": " Yup, I said \"on my personal guitars\" because I am keeping this one for myself"}
{"source": " The neck is very fast and comfy, it's NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me"}
{"source": " The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine, once again if it ain't broke don't fix it"}
{"source": " Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut"}
{"source": " I've set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work, doesn't matter what price point you are at"}
{"source": " This also has a bolt on neck"}
{"source": " A lot of players say you have to have a set (glued) neck"}
{"source": " I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit, I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound, IMO"}
{"source": " I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good"}
{"source": " I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking"}
{"source": " My advice is to go try one, my taste may not be the same as yours"}
{"source": " There are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days, I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special"}
{"source": " Get one, get it set up for a few bucks if you can't do it yourself, and you will have a good instrument"}
{"source": " Oh did I mention this is a very good looking guitar?"}
{"source": "If you are considering this guitar, I have to assume you're shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end, not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom"}
{"source": "  It is in the category of beginner/intermediate guitars that I rate this a 5 star instrument"}
{"source": "I really couldn't find anything \"wrong\"  with it"}
{"source": "  Yes, it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls, such as having only two controls for volume and tone, rather than four, which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous Gibson"}
{"source": "  But you weren't planning to try to fool anyone, were you?  Beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique, rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway"}
{"source": "The sound is good, and I found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine"}
{"source": "  The pickups are surprisingly good"}
{"source": "  The same electronics are found on some of the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls"}
{"source": "  It was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good, although it would sure be nice if they didn't cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality"}
{"source": "As for fit and finish, reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both, and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a Monday after a long weekend of partying"}
{"source": "  For several reasons, if I had this to do over, I would not buy it online (nor would I buy it from GC)"}
{"source": "  Better to inspect the actual guitar you'll be buying, and don't be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don't like the first one you see"}
{"source": "I discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price, but they would have included a full professional setup, including string change"}
{"source": "  You are likely to find a similar deal where you live, because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the Internet and GC"}
{"source": "As it is, I took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup"}
{"source": "  It had some intonation problem, the action was too high, and as others have commented, the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately"}
{"source": "  I asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners, as I'd read a lot of people trashing the tuners"}
{"source": "  Bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them, he instead assured me that they were fairly decent, and advised against changing them unless a problem develops"}
{"source": "Out of the box, I was a little unsure of my purchase"}
{"source": "  However, now that it's been fully set up  and new strings installed, I am quite pleased with this guitar"}
{"source": "  I don't believe you will find a better guitar, or even close, at this price level"}
{"source": "I did a lot of shopping, and considered guitars up to $500 for my first foray into electric"}
{"source": "  I was tempted to go with something more expensive, on the theory that in a couple years, I'll want to upgrade anyway"}
{"source": "  Now I'm glad I chose this one"}
{"source": "  For one thing, this is a guitar I'll always enjoy having around"}
{"source": "  There is nothing cheap or toy-like about it"}
{"source": "  In 2-3 years, my tastes may change"}
{"source": "  I may want something completely different down the road, and now I still have that option"}
{"source": "  Had I gone with a more expensive model, I'd feel locked in"}
{"source": "  No good!BOTTOM LINE:  If you're shopping for a guitar in this price range, I think you'll be pleased with this guitar"}
{"source": "  Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you're buying, and negotiate to have a setup included, because it will almost certainly need one"}
{"source": "  Have it set up right, install some quality strings, and you'll be very happy with the Epiphone LP Special II"}
{"source": "I got one of these a while back and being like I am with guitars took it apart to see just what it's made of"}
{"source": "Mahogany ply maybe or capped with real, but it's plywood body inside"}
{"source": "Kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there"}
{"source": "Otherwise decent build, basic original lp design bolt on, surprisingly good electronics w/ full size pots and open back 3 way toggle, good neck but bad tuners"}
{"source": " Note: any 45% mount tuners, meaning mount hole at 8 and 4 o'clock position respectively"}
{"source": " Will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had"}
{"source": "  So add 10$ to get more than 30 minute in tune play here"}
{"source": "And you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin with"}
{"source": "I like the style, and though there's plywood involved still good fit and finish, though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are, only in looks"}
{"source": "  Electric guitars don't resonate, that's why pickups are important"}
{"source": "I don't like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys"}
{"source": "You lose interest learning on something that can't hold good tuning"}
{"source": "  So that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that"}
{"source": "It's likely they'll keep this style but revise it some"}
{"source": " to be hardwood body and real tuners as I  think the price point demands it"}
{"source": "  Otherwise a decent piece good wiring, decent pickups"}
{"source": " But"}
{"source": "My axesEpiphone LP Studio deluxe plustopFender MarauderTakamine G320Squier Standard StratSquier Standard PJ bassBeen playing 20 years"}
{"source": "I had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I didn't care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with"}
{"source": " But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith"}
{"source": " I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $130 and they kicked in free strings"}
{"source": "Bought it for a game, but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good, played so well, and had a killer tone"}
{"source": "My LP Studio had it's pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81/85's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have"}
{"source": " Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain, tone, and playability"}
{"source": " Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier, it is easily twice the guitar for that price"}
{"source": " You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2"}
{"source": "Sound: 5/5Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound"}
{"source": "The pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect"}
{"source": "The pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic"}
{"source": " Not sure which they have"}
{"source": "So much sustain for a bolt on neck"}
{"source": " I was shocked"}
{"source": "Build Quality 4/5I did have 1 problem with the high E tuner"}
{"source": " I didn't notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4\" up out of the headstock"}
{"source": " When I discovered this I loosened the string, whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way"}
{"source": "Intonation required no adjustment"}
{"source": "Action was exactly the way I like itNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow"}
{"source": "The finish was perfect"}
{"source": " No nicks, blemishes, just oily black goodness"}
{"source": "Neck was flush with no gaps or seams, and professionally shimmed"}
{"source": " Damn good for a bolt on"}
{"source": "Hardware is typical for the price but does the job, stays in tune very well"}
{"source": "Back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable"}
{"source": "The bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup"}
{"source": " Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts, IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings"}
{"source": "Weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it"}
{"source": " No pickguard and it doesn't need one"}
{"source": " Lots of relief between strings and body"}
{"source": " You won't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick"}
{"source": " Makes it easy to clean too!Truss rod is behind a nice body color plate"}
{"source": "Frets were smooth, rounded, and played nice"}
{"source": " Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough"}
{"source": "Neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to"}
{"source": " I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top, soon got used to it and it wasn't an issue"}
{"source": "500k pots and side body 1/4 TRplug keeps the cable out of the way"}
{"source": "Overall 5/5Came with hex keys for setupCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar modelsCame with a nice bumper stickerNo manualBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks, about the same as any other $150 guitar"}
{"source": "Summary: This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own"}
{"source": " It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box"}
{"source": " IT's well built, plays well, and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music"}
{"source": " The frets are medium jumbo's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet (2 squiers in this price range)"}
{"source": "I would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music"}
{"source": " I did blues, metal, country, and pop"}
{"source": " The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender, not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity"}
{"source": "One thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge"}
{"source": " This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain"}
{"source": " I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way"}
{"source": "As an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it"}
{"source": " What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE"}
{"source": " The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower, still no hum but you wouldn't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil"}
{"source": " I ended up putting the screws back in"}
{"source": "I will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81/85's in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar"}
{"source": "Do yourself a favor, buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar"}
{"source": " It's cheap enough that you won't care if you bang it around a little, and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years"}
{"source": "This guitar is very attractive looking, and plays well right out of the box"}
{"source": "  I am a beginner guitarist, so please take this review for what it's worth"}
{"source": "  I am extremely pleased, and don't plan on ever upgrading"}
{"source": "  This guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture"}
{"source": "  So expect it to be a different color than what you order"}
{"source": "  See customer pics"}
{"source": "It comes with strings installed and almost tuned"}
{"source": "  The volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use"}
{"source": "  The tremble and rhythm switch is far enough out of the way that you're not going to accidently hit it while strumming"}
{"source": "  My only gripe is that the high E string gets caught on the top pickup when I'm playing hard, but maybe I'm just a novice"}
{"source": "  I will say that it's very easy to play"}
{"source": "Everything on it is very adjustable which I also like"}
{"source": "  The only BUYER BEWARE statement I can think of is: you're going to be addicted to it!"}
{"source": "I purchased this when it was on sale during the Christmas season - I figured that for the asking price at the time I could not go wrong"}
{"source": "My expectations were frankly low"}
{"source": " I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones, with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune"}
{"source": " Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability"}
{"source": " What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish, and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it"}
{"source": ")I am not wild about the strings that came stock, but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums"}
{"source": " I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads"}
{"source": " In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withD'Addario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Light, 12-52, which, while thick, should make the instrument jazz-friendly"}
{"source": " I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation, but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me, the new strings and work will be an investment"}
{"source": "Out of the box, though, the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed"}
{"source": " I have already invested in a good - but not great case:Guardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar (I also uploaded a customer-provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits"}
{"source": ")For the record, I use the following amp, which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar:Kustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom  The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H Head"}
{"source": "Bottom line: this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players"}
{"source": " The price is right, and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year"}
{"source": "Listen,If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability, buy this one"}
{"source": "  Period"}
{"source": "I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work, in case the guys called for a practice session, so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear"}
{"source": "I have other, way more expensive guitars, like a Gibson ES-335, Dean 12 string, and a Fender Strat, but I gotta tell you, I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding"}
{"source": "And if it gets banged up, so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another"}
{"source": "  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes, just for a cheap change up guitar"}
{"source": "Dig it"}
{"source": "I'm updating a previous negative review"}
{"source": " I had some issues with this guitar when it arrived"}
{"source": " I couldn't get it setup, the action was very high and I couldn't set the intonation"}
{"source": " Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp, and I couldn't lower them with saddle adjustments"}
{"source": " I missed one vital checkpoint, the bridge needed to be lowered"}
{"source": " Setup is finished, and I can now agree with most reviewers"}
{"source": " For the price, this guitar is far better than any others in the price range"}
{"source": " I know my grandson will enjoy it, at least for awhile"}
{"source": " If it ends up as a dust collector, I'm not out much on the purchase price"}
{"source": " I'll add it back to my own collection, and upgrade the electronics"}
{"source": "I purchased this guitar after much thoughtful consideration of other possibilities, but the nearly universal high marks for this particular make and model finally persuaded me to go with this one, and I do not regret that decision"}
{"source": "First of all, it is a beauty"}
{"source": " Initially, I was a little disappointed in that very little wood grain shows through the orangish finish"}
{"source": " (My guitar was made in China, which may account for the darker hue"}
{"source": ") I thought I had wanted a lighter color, but the more I look at it the happier I am with what I have"}
{"source": " Second, this instrument is no light-weight, either in heft or playability"}
{"source": " It is solidly constructed, very well put together, and plays like a dream"}
{"source": " (I lowered the action until I encountered some fret buzz, then backed off the adjusting screws just a bit; that's basically the only adjustment I've made, or likely will make"}
{"source": ")It's been barely a day since the guitar arrived and, as yet, I've only played it unplugged"}
{"source": " I can't wait to hear how it sounds amped up"}
{"source": "I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff"}
{"source": "  I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price"}
{"source": "  I've read just about everything I can on these Epi's and finally went to my local Music store to try one out"}
{"source": "  My initial impression was somewhat mixed"}
{"source": "  The sound was good but the action seemed \"off\"  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar"}
{"source": "  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for"}
{"source": "  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat)"}
{"source": "  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish"}
{"source": "  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit"}
{"source": " Instantly I was in love"}
{"source": "  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I'm used to)"}
{"source": "  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated"}
{"source": "  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway)"}
{"source": "  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar"}
{"source": "  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body"}
{"source": "  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics"}
{"source": "  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body)"}
{"source": "  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer"}
{"source": " Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, AND they will do a FREE setup for me after I've played it for a while (so far it's been perfect out of the box)"}
{"source": "I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago, and have always loved it"}
{"source": " I only use 3-4 pedals, and this is always one of them"}
{"source": " It sounds great, is indestructable, and takes up almost no space"}
{"source": " The controls are great, and you can get a large variety of sounds"}
{"source": " I have played \"boutique\" chorus pedals, and the Boss is loads better in every way"}
{"source": " You will not regret this purchase"}
{"source": "Pros:-easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons:-NONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever, will last forever, and sounds incredible, get this"}
{"source": "I bought this little pedal back in 1996, about a year after I got my first guitar"}
{"source": "  I've tried other pedals, but ultimately, this one gives me the best sound"}
{"source": "  It's very versatile and it's really easy to dial in just about any sound I want"}
{"source": "  You might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units, but for cost and practicality, this pedal is your best bet!"}
{"source": "First, let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box"}
{"source": "Its a Boss product, which means you are going to pay for what you get"}
{"source": "  You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products"}
{"source": "  Solid, rugged construction that is built to last (no chance of breaking one of these things) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound"}
{"source": "  Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal, resale prices are always good"}
{"source": "While this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds (chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion)  Here are some of the best uses I have found"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect"}
{"source": "  Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects"}
{"source": "  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much"}
{"source": "  There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching, tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": "  Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads"}
{"source": "  This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out"}
{"source": "  If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it doesn't matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it"}

{"source": "  Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing, you will always find a use for it, so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig"}
{"source": "In addition you have some great features, easy access battery compartment, accepts a 9v power supply, works well with both guitar and bass, 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired, and all the controls you need to really be in complete control"}
{"source": "  You HAVE to get this pedal!"}
{"source": "OK"}
{"source": " I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road"}
{"source": " I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs"}
{"source": " I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection"}
{"source": " After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit"}
{"source": " I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but, I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better"}
{"source": "Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!"}
{"source": "As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned, 'you will need a noise gate to use this pedal'"}
{"source": " I completely agree with that"}
{"source": " And it will sustain your notes"}
{"source": " It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain"}
{"source": " But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up"}
{"source": " The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate"}
{"source": " I use the NS-2 when I use my chain of pedals"}
{"source": " That said, this pedals has some wonderful uses"}
{"source": " Every note will have the same volume"}
{"source": " You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume"}
{"source": " You can set it to sustain for days"}
{"source": " Again, you will need a noise gate"}
{"source": " There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors, but none of them are as \"ACTIVE\" as this one"}
{"source": " Perhaps that's the price you pay for what this pedal can do"}
{"source": " I recommend messing with it quite a while"}
{"source": " You can do some incredible funk, jazz, metal vibes out of it"}
{"source": "It really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a BOSS product, since I'm such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall"}
{"source": "  Those compliments apply equally to the CS-3 Compression Sustainer"}
{"source": "  And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain"}
{"source": "However, there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know"}
{"source": "  The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds \"noise\" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit"}
{"source": "  The former complaint is probably true, though if you're enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer, you're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor, such as the BOSS NS-2"}
{"source": "  Problem solved"}
{"source": "As for the latter complaint (changes tone), that's also true, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results"}
{"source": "  The whole point of the CS-3 is that it's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it"}
{"source": "  This can result in a muddy, \"neutered\" tone, though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it"}
{"source": "  I also find that with the settings all at 12 O'Clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings"}
{"source": "Really, while BOSS pedals are considered to be \"expensive\" compared to many of the other effects out there, the CS-3 should really be viewed as a \"budget\" or \"entry level\" compressor, when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of $200"}
{"source": "  The best thing you can say about the BOSS (even compared to the similarly-priced MXR options) is that the CS-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price"}
{"source": "  The biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound might seem a little too"}
{"source": "compressed"}
{"source": "But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3, and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus, delay, some distortions) that you're trying to smooth out"}
{"source": "  Ultimately, it's a pedal that could have been better, though there aren't too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway"}
{"source": "As a pro musician, I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations"}
{"source": " I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought"}
{"source": "When I upgraded my pedal board, I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes"}
{"source": " Boss is the company that dominates my effects board"}
{"source": " I rely on their Chormatic Tuner, Digital Delay (2 of them), Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice)"}
{"source": "With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really, really like this unit"}
{"source": " It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the \"On\" position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars, especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own"}
{"source": "Think of this as an artist's tool"}
{"source": "  And for every job there is the 'right' tool"}
{"source": "  Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it"}
{"source": "  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles"}
{"source": "  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s"}
{"source": "  But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise"}
{"source": "  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense"}
{"source": " It it doesn't make sense, there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger"}
{"source": "  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Kurt Cobain"}
{"source": " It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians"}
{"source": "  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out"}
{"source": "  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair"}
{"source": " I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it"}
{"source": "  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking"}
{"source": "  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads"}
{"source": "  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp"}
{"source": "  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp"}
{"source": "I have had this pedal for about 15 years, just replaced the old one a month ago"}
{"source": " It distorts sound, not quite the way you would imagine though"}
{"source": " This effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color"}
{"source": " I use it through a Epiphone Valve Jr and a Marshall 2x12 stack with JTM45 on top and its fine"}
{"source": " This thing through a Champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a EQ pedal"}
{"source": "This does just what it says it does"}
{"source": " One Volume knob, one tone, and one distortion knob"}
{"source": " CRANK IT"}
{"source": "This pedal is a must have for any pedal board"}
{"source": " I love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray"}
{"source": " Thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best"}
{"source": "This was the first pedal I ever bought when I started playing guitar 15 years ago"}
{"source": "  It's still in my primary set up!  The sound it puts out is very balanced:  you can get a subtle overdrive-like sound out of it, or a high-gain hard rock/80's metal sound out of it"}
{"source": "  For those looking for insane crunch, this isn't for you"}
{"source": "  Anyone that wants a nice, versatile pedal, this IS the one you want!"}
{"source": "This is a cheap piece of junk that does what it says, it distorts, You want something to make your guitar sound like junk, this will do it"}
{"source": " Why pedals that make your guitar sound like a piece of junk are the most popular is beyond me"}
{"source": " This is not a boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use"}
{"source": " Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron"}
{"source": "These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion"}
{"source": "From Greg Abrams review, entitled \"For all but the tone snobs,\" a review further down on this product's page:\"Alright, so you want to get a good (if somewhat \"basic\") distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal"}
{"source": "\"I strongly disagree"}
{"source": "  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less, even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at"}
{"source": "I've played guitar for over 10 years"}
{"source": "  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1"}
{"source": "  Afterall, everyone talks about them, they're available at any given music store in the nation, you hear about all these famous musicians using them, plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else"}
{"source": "  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR, that doesn't always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback, the Transformers movie franchise, the Kardashian family, etc"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "So I plugged it in and didn't really care for it"}
{"source": "  The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy"}
{"source": "  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R, and my big amp, the B-52 AT100, which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse, and the basic sound was not very likeable to me"}
{"source": "  I've read the Japanese made DS-1's are better in sound than the newer, made in Taiwan models but, either way, the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind"}
{"source": "But, like many newer players, I didn't know any better at the time"}
{"source": "  Fast forward a few years and I've bought and sold literally dozens of pedals"}
{"source": "  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open"}
{"source": "So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1"}
{"source": "  All of them are great general purpose distortions, easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops, and can, at the time of this writing, be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol' Amazon"}
{"source": "com, and are rugged enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking I'm a Boss hater (I'm certainly not, I loved the TU-3, the ODB-3, the MD-2, and the XT-2, among others) I'll start with the DS-1's big brother"}
{"source": "  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes"}
{"source": "  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1, the II setting is a brighter, richer tone"}
{"source": "  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity, you can find DS-2's all over ebay for very cheap prices"}
{"source": "  A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many"}
{"source": "Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal"}
{"source": "  Probably my personal favorite"}
{"source": "  You've heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years, its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists"}
{"source": "  Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy"}
{"source": "  I've never heard a bad tone out of mine"}
{"source": " Its great for getting a \"big amp\" kind of sound out of a small practice amp"}
{"source": "  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume"}
{"source": "  A truly excellent pedal"}
{"source": "EHX Little Big Muff:  The Big Muff is another pedal you've heard on hundreds of songs"}
{"source": "  Its kind of a fuzz, kind of a distortion, but definitely owns its own sonic territory"}
{"source": "  Very big, saturated and warm"}
{"source": "  Used heavily in the 70's for classic rock tones, also in the 90's and beyond for tons of grunge and garage"}
{"source": "  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins, Dinosaur Jr"}
{"source": " and Jack White"}
{"source": "  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff, not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue, its smaller, uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal"}
{"source": "MXR Distortion +:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion, and can usually be found pretty cheap"}

{"source": " you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp, it doesn't cover over your equipments sound"}

{"source": "Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal, NOT the Metal II"}
{"source": "  That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal"}
{"source": "  The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals"}
{"source": "  Basically, its a pre-amp that sits on the floor"}
{"source": "  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof"}
{"source": "  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff, with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between"}
{"source": "  It works well with any amp I've tried it on, and you can find tons of great sounds"}
{"source": "  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal, and its even true bypass"}
{"source": "  The best part is, Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them, so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30"}
{"source": "  A true hidden gem that's actually CHEAPER than a DS-1"}
{"source": "Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion:  This little guy surprised me"}
{"source": "  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box, and, if so, that must be one awesome pedal too"}
{"source": "  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box, and boy does it ever succeed at that"}
{"source": "  Great crunch, tons of volume and gain, it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin' stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp, and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in), and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped, fantastic!Speaking of Joyo, I've had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN, another Chinese pedal maker, and I'm honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff I've ever played through)"}
{"source": "  So JOYO and MOEN, they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz, od, and dirt pedals, check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company, please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review, DS-1 included, are made in America, let alone the western hemisphere)"}
{"source": "Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for"}
{"source": "  Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do"}
{"source": "I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you"}
{"source": "  Tone is subjective, every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps, and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love, that's okay"}
{"source": "  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information"}
{"source": "  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals, the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there that's affordable"}
{"source": "  Find something you truly love and buy that"}
{"source": "  If its the DS-1, one of the pedals I've mentioned here, or anything else, the important part is that it sounds right to YOU"}
{"source": "Here's the deal with this pedal"}
{"source": " It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money"}
{"source": " In my opinion, for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal, whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal, a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it"}
{"source": "This pedal has been around for a long time, and though the overall quality has declined as Boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals, the boss ds-1 remains the staple image of distortion stompbox's"}
{"source": " The ds-1 is a no-frills tank of a pedal; it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as Michael Moore stepping on it, so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it"}
{"source": "This pedal doesn't replicate any type of amplifier-it's not a \"Marshall-in-a-box, or a mesa boogie, or a vox, or a Fender; from a tonal aspect it isn't complex or dynamic"}
{"source": " It will add plenty of grind to your tone, and plenty of hum to go with it"}
{"source": " If you're looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15-watt practice amp, look no further"}
{"source": " If you have a decent tube amp, look elsewhere, because with this pedal, you get what you pay for, and it simply will not do a quality amp justice"}
{"source": "Pros: Inexpensive, good build quality, distorts your signal"}
{"source": "Cons: Lots of hum, the tone control gets really shrill really fast"}
{"source": "Without the excessive hum and almost-unusable tone control, this would get 4 stars"}
{"source": " it's a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp"}
{"source": "  The same is true of many of the pedals from this era, including the (gasp!) Tube Screamer"}
{"source": "  The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp, but not too many people will tell you that it's a great stand-alone distortion because it's not"}
{"source": "  Same goes for the Boss DS-1"}
{"source": "  Now, here's where things get interesting:  There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely, Monte Allums, and others, that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast, dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks"}
{"source": "  For the cost of this pedal, and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod, are well worth it"}
{"source": "  Mine is modified with the Monte Allums Tri-Gain Rectifier modification and it's absolutely killer"}
{"source": "  I use it as a lead boost, but by itself it's a nice overdriven tone that you'll find plenty of use for"}
{"source": "  If you want a basic, solid, well-built distortion pedal, this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special"}
{"source": "  But as a platform for great-sounding mods, you can't go wrong"}
{"source": "To be honest, I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB"}
{"source": " So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet, but ive got close enough to it"}
{"source": " This pedal is great, only a couple notes I should make about it"}
{"source": " Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock, or just rock in general"}
{"source": " This pedal is for metal"}
{"source": " The battery drains like a MF"}
{"source": " I dont understand why"}
{"source": " The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp, but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON"}
{"source": " I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries"}
{"source": " Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal"}
{"source": "I have a lot of pedals"}
{"source": "  In fact, I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals (though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig"}
{"source": ")  This pedal won't give you a \"cranked up tube stack\" sound"}
{"source": "  No"}
{"source": "  Instead, it's very edgy and smooth as can be"}
{"source": "  It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone"}
{"source": "  I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos"}

{"source": "  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot"}
{"source": "  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful"}
{"source": "I've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz"}
{"source": "  I must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig"}
{"source": "  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2"}
{"source": "  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response"}
{"source": "I say the MT-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal"}
{"source": "  Surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board"}
{"source": "This is a great pedal I picked up used, they can be had cheaply on the used market"}
{"source": " I actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit"}
{"source": " The 2 EQ pots on the front panel make it very versatile, enough to use with a cigar box guitar also"}
{"source": "The pedal can preserve bass signal and still be EQ'd for saturated distortion"}
{"source": " The other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular"}
{"source": " I also other Boss Distortion pedals"}
{"source": " Like most people, I own a DS-1 and an MD-2 which are both cheap and effective"}
{"source": " I own a HM-2 Heavy Metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and I actually think this pedal is more versatile IMO with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone"}
{"source": "I also own an older 80's HM-2 Heavy Metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that I could never part with, overall i like this pedal, but it cannot top the older legendary Boss pedals"}
{"source": "This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years"}
{"source": "  It really does have a ton of range, although it only does one effect at a time, so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations"}
{"source": "  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock, which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect"}
{"source": "  If you want any of those 90's sounds, excluding the heavier metal sounds, this pedal will definitely get you there"}
{"source": "I first used this pedal when my green screemer died"}
{"source": " A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it"}
{"source": " I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking"}
{"source": " So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced"}
{"source": " I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones"}
{"source": " I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed"}
{"source": " I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end, my search ended with this pedal"}
{"source": " I highly recomend this pedal to any rock, blues, metal, country, or punk guitar player"}
{"source": "It's a good OD, but I thought it would be higher output, and more articulate"}
{"source": " Just personal preference"}
{"source": " I mean, the Pedal is a Classic for a reason"}
{"source": "excellentI like I am very happyI am looking for money for the following purchase for amazonthe pedal boss arrives in the time necessary thank you"}

{"source": "  The enclosure, dials, and footswitch are all durable"}
{"source": "  Not true bypass, but none of the BOSS pedals are"}
{"source": "  It doesn't suck tone"}
{"source": "  This pedal isn't the end-all be-all overdrive, but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that TS pedals don't"}
{"source": " You lose a little low end when it is engaged, but that actually works pretty well for leads- especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of 'classic' distortion encountered with EL84s"}
{"source": "  As a stand alone overdrive, I prefer other pedals"}
{"source": "  But where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp"}
{"source": "  You get singing, harmonic leads when it is dialed in right"}
{"source": "  Like any overdrive, you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far"}
{"source": "  I am a dirtbox hoarder and I like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations"}
{"source": "  Lately, I am running this into either the V1 Cool Cat transparent overdrive (Timmy Clone - very, very nice) or the Behringer BO-100 (which is a dead ringer for the Boss Blues Driver) then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch (Jet City Combo or Palomino Combo)"}
{"source": "  As with any overdrive, this thing will not sound very good (IMHO) running into a solid state amp"}
{"source": "  That's just not what it was intended to do"}
{"source": " It was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but YMMV"}
{"source": " Because I'm a cheapskate (and because these things are durable like bricks) I bought it used for $20, but it is well worth the new asking price"}

{"source": "  As with any other Boss pedals, it's well made and reliable"}
{"source": "I bought this pedal used and have used it with both a Fender tube amp and a Marshall solid state using clean channels"}
{"source": " I can get a variety of tones from it with different guitars, and reccomend it as a first overdrive or to add to a collection"}
{"source": "While I have several overdrive pedals, this one is good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping the amps low end"}
{"source": " I can get decent tones from a Telecaster and Les Psul by keeping the level and tone knobs below 12 o'clock and adjusting the drive to taste"}
{"source": "The OD sounds great through Fender clean tubes and I also tried it with a bass guitar"}

{"source": " Great chrunch for the buck From classic blues to rock its very eash to dial the sound you want in"}
{"source": "Great as a booster, as others have said"}
{"source": " For solos, it'll boost your mids and your signal"}
{"source": " As an overdrive, it's great, kind of a midsy, Marshally sound"}
{"source": " It does suck out some of the low end, but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever"}
{"source": " It's a Boss, it's solid - and a great price"}
{"source": " Remember, this is overdrive - not distortion"}
{"source": " For distortion, look at other Boss pedals"}
{"source": "I have several overdrive pedals, some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD-1"}
{"source": " For a long time I overlooked my SD-1 and used other pedals"}
{"source": " But when I went back to trying the SD-1, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using"}
{"source": " I don't mean merely that it's \"very good relative to its price\"; I mean that it's \"very good--period"}
{"source": "\" It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more"}
{"source": " The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $45 on Amazon"}
{"source": " At that price, it's an amazingly good deal"}
{"source": " Note: This is definitely an overdive pedal; it will not deliver metal distortion (at least not by itself)"}
{"source": " If you want to ride the crazy train, look elsewhere (like Deltalab's Metal Distortion pedal)"}
{"source": " What this produces is smooth old-style overdrive"}
{"source": " It's excellent"}
{"source": " It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus"}
{"source": " I plug my SD-1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amp's chorus; the result is delicious"}
{"source": " I've used the SD-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups"}
{"source": " Both sound good, though, not surprisingly, you get a heavier punch with a humbucker"}
{"source": " But it sounds great with single-coils too"}
{"source": "Forget all the volume drop comments"}
{"source": "  There isn't any and it does not color your tone one bit"}
{"source": "  I have tried a couple miniature novelty pedals"}
{"source": " They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in"}
{"source": "  I wanted something to dress up slow ballads, and of course \"Born On The Bayou\""}
{"source": "  This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it"}
{"source": "  And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on"}
{"source": " I play a lot of acoustic solo and this really is a nice addition to change up my sound here and there and not over do it"}
{"source": "Sure there are fancier Tremolo pedals out there, but I've always been a fan of the Boss TR-2"}
{"source": " It's got a more mellow and vintage Fender Tremolo output, and suits my playing to a T"}
{"source": " Pair this beauty up with an Electro-Harmonix Cathedral Reverb pedal, and get lost for days"}
{"source": " Definitely worth the reasonable cost!"}
{"source": "This tremelo pedal works nicely and it's great when you're playing through an amp without tremelo"}
{"source": " Problem solved! The price was also very good"}
{"source": "I've played this pedal for a while now and really dig it"}
{"source": " I'm old school, Fender Blues Deluxe reissue and Strats and Teles, this pedal has a great, warm, organic feeling tremolo that I use a lot"}
{"source": " You can barely bring it in for some warmth, or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect"}
{"source": "I'll use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck"}
{"source": " This effect will give you a nice almost Hammond B-3 type of organ sound"}
{"source": "This is a superb tremolo pedal: [1] Its dials allow for enormous control of the effect"}
{"source": " [2] It's very sturdy--an often-noted feature of BOSS pedals"}
{"source": " Further, [3] it's utterly easy to use, [4] allows for both 9v battery and power supply/adapter operation, and, most important of all, [5] it delivers beautiful tremolo"}
{"source": " (Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed, but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter"}
{"source": ") If the price is more than you're willing to pay, consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO"}
{"source": " This also delivers good tremolo, but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; it's still quite good, but the BOSS takes the prize"}
{"source": " I paid about $75 for mine and have zero regrets"}
{"source": "I own three units capable of tremolo: Boss TR-2, Line 6 MM4, and the Boss SL-20 Slicer (like a tremolo on steroids)"}
{"source": " Plus my amp is a Twin Reverb so it too has tremolo"}
{"source": " If you are unfamiliar, tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly"}
{"source": "The Boss TR-2 is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate, with three controls: \"Rate\" of modulation, \"Depth\" of modulation (how much does the volume vary), and a \"Wave\" shape (jagged, square, or somewhere on a continuum in between)"}
{"source": " Unlike the other Boss stompboxes I own (CE-5 & PH-3), the TR-2 does not seem to compress sound so that it seems like you're \"playing in a fishbowl\" (as another reviewer puts it)"}
{"source": "The \"Wave\" control is what gives the unit its sonic versatility, so it is a nice feature to have"}
{"source": " Most tremolos have it, but not all"}
{"source": " For the price, it can give you a decent set of classic tremolo sounds with nothing too crazy"}
{"source": " It is the unit that Tom Morello uses on \"Guerilla Radio,\" and it does well with tremolo classics like the Smiths \"How Soon Is Now?\" I hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest, and this is something I am sensitive to because I generally turn modulations on/off over the course of a song rather than leave them on full time"}
{"source": "Like all Boss stuff, the box is sturdy and I like their big, quiet footswitches over any of the little, clicky ones on other units"}
{"source": " The color is a sort of a dull military dark green, not the most attractive thing but not bad either"}
{"source": "The small Boss effects do not come with a power cable, so you will have to factor that into the cost"}
{"source": " Boss instructions tell you that you need their particular adapter, but I don't know anyone who says this is a must"}
{"source": " I run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine"}
{"source": " If it didn't I would not buy Boss product period"}
{"source": "Bottom Line:(1) Gives a decent array of basic tremolo sounds, nothing crazy(2) Not a bad price (factor in a power cable)(3) Simple to operate(4) Nice casing and footswitch; drab color"}

{"source": "  As anyone who has one of these pedals knows they eat 9-volts like candy, this is the solution"}
{"source": "  You get one of these and hook it up to a power splitter (Search for Visual Sound One Spot Multi-Plug 5 Cable) and you are good to go for up to 5 pedals!  No more battery swaps, no more searching for a 9-volt every 5 minutes"}
{"source": "Great pedal, but if you pull it open and put in a couple of cheap mods, this thing is absolutley rediculous!  It's a boutique pedal with only a little time and solder"}
{"source": "The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on, which produces a sound"}
{"source": "  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch, so you can turn them on or off at a given position"}
{"source": "  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency"}
{"source": "  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle, and just leave it there"}

{"source": "  There is a big drop in the freq"}
{"source": " that kills the effect"}
{"source": "  You have to pump your foot really fast to avoid having that drop"}

{"source": "  Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board"}
{"source": "  I can't say its just a complete piece of junk, it does give you a wah effect, it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing?  I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue, I still had to slam on it to turn it on/off and it still sounded like a cheap wah"}
{"source": "My suggestion?  The Mark Tremonti wah is great!  Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use!  It may cost more, but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway, so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with"}
{"source": "  What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor"}
{"source": "  You may say that this is a cheap processor, and it is, but I've been using it for years and I haven't seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters"}
{"source": "  Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity, how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on (I have mine set fairly light) and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily"}
{"source": "  You even have presets (crybaby being one of them)  You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit more"}

{"source": "It's a very cute little capo"}
{"source": " It works great on my ukulele and mandolin but of course it's hard to use because when you get into the higher frets the frets are VERY small"}
{"source": " But it works"}
{"source": "Although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin, it only works correctly above the 3rd or 4th fret on my mandolin"}

{"source": "I have a number of Kyser capos and very much like the style (I own at least six Kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a Taylor 12-String to a Fender American Strat without any problems), but in this case the banjo capo didn't work for what I need"}
{"source": " Perhaps the capo sent to me was defective, although I have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didn't seem broken, just not up to the task"}
{"source": "From feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it, but I know that I don't have time while on stage to take 20 seconds to set a fussy capo 'just right' to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesn't start to buzz on me in the middle of a song"}

{"source": "  I also didn't particularly care for the push button release, and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a C clamp, not a nut, so there's no allowance for differing thickness"}

{"source": "  I've struggled with the C clip in the past, but what are you going to do?  It's a one time thing when you first install, so it's no biggie"}
{"source": "I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product"}
{"source": " A work-around for the main issue follows the review"}
{"source": " The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws"}
{"source": " Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with"}
{"source": " 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws"}
{"source": "2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver"}
{"source": " However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons"}
{"source": " So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job"}
{"source": "3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar"}
{"source": " The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch"}
{"source": " Therefore any lateral stress (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw"}
{"source": " A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course)"}
{"source": " Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher"}
{"source": "Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review"}
{"source": " Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people"}
{"source": " So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1\" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws"}
{"source": " Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified"}
{"source": " (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this"}
{"source": ")Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill"}
{"source": " Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head"}
{"source": " It doesn't need much"}
{"source": " I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each"}
{"source": " While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button"}
{"source": "Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!"}
{"source": "Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big"}
{"source": " They stand out too much"}
{"source": " They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced"}
{"source": " There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap"}
{"source": "  Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant"}
{"source": " I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play"}
{"source": " Not cool"}
{"source": "I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy"}
{"source": "  I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago, and I dont recall having this issue, so I'm thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point"}
{"source": "  I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle, and the locks are secure"}
{"source": "  However, due to this issue, I'm considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks"}
{"source": "  I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon"}
{"source": "The Dunlop Dual Design Straplock System is a sturdy, fairly easy-to-assemble and easy-to-install alternative to guitar straps slipping off of instruments"}
{"source": "  The screws that are used to attach the Straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large--there's little chance that these are going to come out"}
{"source": "  The locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance"}
{"source": "  The only disadvantage of the Dunlop system to Schaller's system is that the the Dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitar's body"}
{"source": "  Ordinarily, it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences"}
{"source": "  On an instrument such as a Hofner \"violin\" bass, though, or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument, this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support"}
{"source": "  Schaller's strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players"}
{"source": "  The Dunlop Straplok System is sturdy, should provide a long life of service, and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors"}

{"source": "I've been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between)"}
{"source": " Over the years, I've tried several different brands of string"}
{"source": " The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them"}
{"source": " It's just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone"}

{"source": " First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened"}
{"source": " Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric"}
{"source": " When I order something new, I expect it to be new"}
{"source": " Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller"}
{"source": "Yes, you can make your own pop filter at home, but you don't want to"}
{"source": "  Why else would you be reading this?  Besides, it won't look this good"}
{"source": "I've purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months"}
{"source": "  The most recent one I purchased was NOT this one"}
{"source": "  I wish it was"}
{"source": "  I thought I'd try something different, just to see the differences"}
{"source": "  Well, I can tell you that there are significant differences between this, and some of the others featured here"}
{"source": "The bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to"}
{"source": "  The competitors that I've tried do not"}
{"source": "  If you do not have this rubber piece, any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly"}
{"source": "  This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible"}
{"source": "  Fortunately, Nady placed this rubber piece on it's clamp so this has never been an issue"}
{"source": "The only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times"}
{"source": "  A single dot of superglue fixed that"}
{"source": "Compared to the other pop filters I've seen and used, this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you can't beat it"}
{"source": "And yes, pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones"}
{"source": "  Just buy one now, save yourself the trouble"}
{"source": "It does what it's supposed to do"}
{"source": " It's as well made as most, I think"}
{"source": " They all look cheap to me, unless you get a studio professional grade"}
{"source": " The screen pops out easily, but it will pop back in"}
{"source": " It works well for my home recording"}
{"source": "I use it with an Audio Technica 2020, it work very well, the filter stays in place and it really improves the quality of the recording"}
{"source": " Not much else to say"}
{"source": "A needed accessory for any vocal recording, period"}
{"source": " My only gripe about this model is why the straight bracket part needs to stick out so dang far, since you can bend the arm out in any position anyway"}
{"source": "After suffering through crackles, lost signals, and all the rest, I decided to heed the numerous positive reviews of the Spectraflex tweed cable and purchase one through Amazon"}
{"source": "com"}
{"source": "  Because the new acoustic-electric classical I received as a gift has an end-pin outlet, I bought the Spectraflex with the right angle connector"}
{"source": "  Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks, I am very impressed"}
{"source": "  The connections on all the guitars and basses on which I've used it are sure, with no loss of signal, no crackles"}
{"source": "  Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal"}
{"source": "  Finally, I can be confident that when I play, something will consistently come out of the amplifier"}
{"source": "  By the way, the old-school tweed look is a plus, too"}
{"source": "Spectraflex makes great cables"}
{"source": " I bought this right angle 10' red cable for my older Ibanez guitar"}
{"source": " This cable is built to be extremely durable, is made in the USA, and comes with a lifetime warrantee"}
{"source": " The 20 gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable, and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial (especially compared to a cheaper Fender cable I had been using that required almost constant tightening"}
{"source": ") Though Spectraflex cables are not the least expensive (nor the most expensive,) they are a great value and I am definitely a fan"}
{"source": " I recommend this cable without reservations"}
{"source": "I purchased three of these (three different colors) to make a mini-snake for my keyboard to their Di's"}
{"source": "  I typically used Mogami 2524/Neutrik, but need cakes while in the road (I usually roll my own to exact length)"}
{"source": "  These have worked well, quiet, no handling noise, seem well built (I treat cables well, so I don't really test them with under tough circumstances) and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future"}
{"source": "  They are used 6 nights a week, and after 50 uses, no problems"}
{"source": "  I recommend them (plus, for live, the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "  Nice pieces"}
{"source": "There are several types of practice amps"}
{"source": " High end modlers (Line 6, G Dec, Vox VT) that can still run $400+ and are typically overloaded with features"}
{"source": " The low end tubes (Fender Blues Junior, Bug V22, Peavey Valveking, etc)"}
{"source": " These typically are more stripped down (in features, not neccessarily quality)"}
{"source": " And then there are the micros"}
{"source": " I always thought they were just a notch above toys, the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at Christmas"}
{"source": "Boy was I wrong"}
{"source": "I needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school"}
{"source": " It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear"}
{"source": " He's not a big kid, so even 15lb"}
{"source": " amps are pushing it(plus a gig bag and school back pack)"}
{"source": " That was initially what brought me to the Micro"}
{"source": " Not sound or features, just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso"}
{"source": " Turns out this is an AMAZING amp"}
{"source": " The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder (6watt?) or Bug V12"}
{"source": " And the Fender frontman - not even in the ballpark"}
{"source": "Each of the models are distinct"}
{"source": " The cleans are sparkly (more trebly) and the high gain models are very articulate"}
{"source": " Obviously this isn't a loud amp, but that's not all bad"}
{"source": " You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes"}
{"source": " It also can be battery powered (the life is suprisingly long), includes a regular wall plug, headphone jack, built in tuning fork (which is kind of lame) and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously"}
{"source": " For example, I was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some Dick Dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy"}
{"source": "Don't let the size fool you"}
{"source": " I honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and I couldn't have been more wrong"}
{"source": "  There are several big websites and it's tough to find any negatives about this amp"}
{"source": " Quality sounding and durable for a great price"}
{"source": "Oh - and the red - if you can find it - looks pretty sweet too"}
{"source": "The MicroCube came with new AC Adaptor that supports 110V and 240V"}
{"source": " Now I can take it along and use it in Europe/ Asia and USA"}
{"source": "I saved $30 from buying another AC adapter that supports 240V"}
{"source": "Happy Customer!"}
{"source": "i love this thing!!!  action is perfect,  great sound,  good feel, easy to play i highly recomend this"}
{"source": "This case it built really well, it has really nice plush interior"}
{"source": " storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck, it DOES have a lock on one of the latches"}
{"source": " The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it"}
{"source": " Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key"}
{"source": " so dont worry"}
{"source": " Just dont be an idiot like me and give it a good tug when you get it"}
{"source": "Above all it fits my Epi LP perfectly"}
{"source": " as it should! hehe"}
{"source": "Hello, I bought a Epiphone Goth Studio guitar and I also bought this beauty"}
{"source": " I'm very satisfied with the quality of this case, as it makes my guitar looks very nice and very nice protected"}
{"source": "The case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be"}
{"source": " The pocket inside is nice for holding accessories"}
{"source": " It does include a lock on the middle latch, but somehow mine eventually stopped working, as the lock isn't very good quality"}
{"source": " The lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used"}
{"source": " Otherwise great case, highly recommended"}
{"source": "I could not believe the quality of this case, fits my Epiphone Les Paul 100 like a glove"}
{"source": "  Very plush interior, plenty of storage and very durable"}
{"source": "As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more"}
{"source": " If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay"}
{"source": " I purchased it for that reason"}
{"source": "and I'm an adult, so I can be careful"}
{"source": " This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage"}
{"source": " I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag"}
{"source": " It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it"}
{"source": "There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price"}
{"source": "This houses your guitar and I have a couple humidipaks  in there because I live in a northern desert"}
{"source": " Not many frills to this bag"}
{"source": " It does the job"}
{"source": "This gigbag is a very tight fit for my Epiphone Les Paul"}
{"source": " Their is minimal padding, so it is little more than a dust cover"}
{"source": " I tossed it aside, and bought a Fender gigbag"}
{"source": " The Fender is heavily padded, and gives me some serious protection"}
{"source": "At &lt;$20, this is a great bargain, but it is a very basic bag"}
{"source": " It fits my Les Paul Standard snugly and has back straps for easy carrying"}
{"source": " These are also easily removed if they bother you"}
{"source": " This Epiphone gigbag also has a zippered pocket for accessories (holds a strap, patch cord, but not much else) and features nice looking graphics"}
{"source": "I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well"}
{"source": "  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with"}
{"source": "I'm using this footswitch to control a drum machine"}
{"source": " it does the job and i've had no problems with it"}
{"source": "Summary for those who don't want to read the whole thing: This is more than worth the money"}
{"source": " If you're a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you're experienced and are searching for a backup/travel option or anything like that, get this"}
{"source": " Do not hesitate"}
{"source": " A cheap guitar doesn't ALWAYS mean a POS!Alright, full story/review:So, when I was a kid up until my early teens my (insanely talented and self-taught) older brother helped me learn how to play guitar"}
{"source": " I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and I've regretted it basically every day ever since then"}
{"source": " Recently, I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it"}
{"source": " So, here I am"}
{"source": "Having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists, I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars (like a typical beginner's First Act)"}
{"source": " I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it"}
{"source": " I got way more than I bargained for"}
{"source": "I began my quest knowing that my funds were limited"}
{"source": " There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end, top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day"}
{"source": " I knew I had to go cheap, at least for now"}
{"source": " I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars"}
{"source": " After an exhaustive amount of research, I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos I'd pulled up on YouTube were excellent"}
{"source": " Plus, Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general"}
{"source": "Despite the positive reviews, I was still a bit leery; buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble"}
{"source": " Even if it sounds nice and plays well, sometimes a perfectly solid, functional instrument just doesn't FEEL right"}
{"source": " As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason"}
{"source": " I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility I'd just have to bite the bullet and buy something better, even if costlier"}
{"source": "Well, it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed"}
{"source": " I certainly didn't expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error, if only cosmetic, with such a cheap guitar"}
{"source": " I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it"}
{"source": " Even if I had (unless it drastically affected the sound/playability of the instrument), it would still be worth the price"}
{"source": "Along with the guitar I bought some new strings (Martins) because 9/10 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful"}
{"source": " I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable"}
{"source": " I see that some of the other reviewers disagree"}
{"source": " Maybe their strings were older or maybe it's just preference, I don't know"}
{"source": " All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded/old"}
{"source": " Shockingly enough, the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box! It doesn't seem to have any trouble staying in tune, either"}
{"source": " All of that being said, it wouldn't hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe"}
{"source": " I mean, I'm sure that when I do finally put the Martins on I'll be even more mind-blown than I already am with the way it sounds"}
{"source": "This guitar has a full, rich sound, plays comfortably (the low action helps!), and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets"}
{"source": " Oh, and contrary to what other reviews have said - YES, it DOES have a truss rod"}
{"source": " While we're talking about its positives, let's not ignore the fact that it's also super attractive with its shiny black finish"}
{"source": " There isn't much about it that would give away its price"}
{"source": " No, it's not a $1000 guitar but it certainly doesn't play like a $100 guitar either! I don't regret this purchase at all"}
{"source": " Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gem!If you're still unsure, do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube"}
{"source": " I doubt you'll be disappointed"}
{"source": " (Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did"}
{"source": " He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about and I, as well as everyone else in the comments section, was sure to express my feelings about that, haha! One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him!) Check out the video reviews by the users/companies GoldHat3, SamAshMusic, GigGear, and ShadowFW"}
{"source": "My only complaint about this guitar is that I didn't buy it sooner!Good luck on your search, I hope this review has helped!"}
{"source": "First off; let me start by saying I bought this guitar because it was only $100 and I was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before I return home"}
{"source": "I DID NOT: expect good quality, sound or comfortably from this guitar"}
{"source": "I DID: want something cheap I could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashed"}
{"source": "When I unboxed this guitar I was floored! The hardware is much higher quality than I had expected by far"}
{"source": " The strings it came with weren't complete crap, but I swapped them out for my favorite set of strings: Ernie Ball 2406 Ernesto Palla Nylon Black and Silver Classical strings"}
{"source": " The guitar sings beautifully; the tone is rich and vibrant"}
{"source": "It's quite comfortable to play, I have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away"}
{"source": " I'm not a big fan of the pick guard that has the Epiphone 'E' on it, so I will probably end up removing it; but the sunburst is really nice looking"}
{"source": " I have received many compliments on the look of it already"}
{"source": "OVER ALL: this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag"}
{"source": " GET IT!Also; I'm buying a hard case to take it home, or shipping this guitar back home to myself because I want to keep it as part of my collection"}
{"source": " My original thought was to buy this guitar and leave it out here at the Rec tent for other people to use after I'm gone"}
{"source": " Even if I do decide to leave it out here; I'll be buying another one when I get home!"}
{"source": "This is NOT my first guitar"}
{"source": " Nor am I breathless Epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of Taylors and Martins"}
{"source": " It's not"}
{"source": " Here's what it is: An exceedingly well-constucted, AMAZINGLY playable guitar"}
{"source": " Fit, finish, feel and action were all VERY nice"}
{"source": " Sound on the other hand? Let's face it"}
{"source": " It's plywood all around"}
{"source": " It SOUNDS like plywood"}
{"source": " But that doesn't distract from the fact that it's a great guitar for $100 bucks"}
{"source": "It's a fine &#34;first&#34; guitar"}
{"source": " It's a great beach/camping/cabin guitar"}
{"source": " Leave it in your car to practice at lunch"}
{"source": " Leave it in the office"}
{"source": " ANY guitar is better than no guitar"}
{"source": " And this guitar is better than a LOT of other entry level guitars"}
{"source": "Seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box"}
{"source": " New, premium strings DO make a difference"}
{"source": "If your expectations are for a playable, rugged, affordable guitar you won't be disappointed"}
{"source": " If sound quality is your primary concern, well"}
{"source": " You are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy"}
{"source": "For my desired application, this guitar was great"}
{"source": " I'm very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat"}
{"source": "It is my son's first guitar and he is learning on it well"}
{"source": "  It is still in great condition"}
{"source": " good quality Guitar!"}
{"source": "this thing plays great!!  action is low but does not buzz, very easy to chord"}
{"source": "i highly recomend this guitar"}
{"source": "I bought the wrong gauge"}
{"source": " I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong"}
{"source": " I bought the "}
{"source": "90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them"}
{"source": " These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound"}
{"source": " I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them"}
{"source": " Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do"}
{"source": "Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new"}
{"source": "Buy em!!!!"}
{"source": "This polish was recommended in one of Dan Erlewine's books and it works great"}
{"source": "  It really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop"}
{"source": "  The effect isn't as noticeable on darker finishes though"}
{"source": "  It really helps on the back of the neck too, makes it slippery and fast"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended"}
{"source": "Ive been using this polish since the early 80's"}
{"source": " It doesn't smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars"}
{"source": " Wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars"}
{"source": " What has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them, but this polish? No way"}
{"source": " Martin knows what they're doing"}
{"source": " I use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes"}
{"source": "This product is excellent"}
{"source": "  Cleaning is thorough and leaves no residue"}
{"source": "  Made my little Martin look almost as good as new"}
{"source": "I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit)"}
{"source": "  Either way, once plugged in, it sounds great"}
{"source": "  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar, a Blueridge BR-160"}
{"source": "  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good, if not better"}
{"source": "  If you don't mind the pickup visible in the sound hole, this is the way to go"}
{"source": "  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar"}
{"source": "This is not a bad product, just not great"}
{"source": "  As soon as I received it, I installed it on my custom made Grit Laskin Guitar, and played with it for over two hours"}
{"source": "  Installation was fast, and only took a couple of minutes"}
{"source": "  My problems with it are 3 fold:  #1"}
{"source": "  Sounds just a bit \"tinny\" = too much on the high end, and not an equal amount of bass"}
{"source": "  #2"}
{"source": "  A small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries, and I couldn't get mine to work in \"passive\" mode"}
{"source": "  #3"}
{"source": "  And the biggest complaint, is that the volume control is difficult to get to when you're performing on stage"}
{"source": "  You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft"}
{"source": "  Like I said, it is not a bad product, just not top notch, and definitely not for professionals"}
{"source": "  If you're just fooling around at home, or recording at home, it is fine, and will do the job for you"}
{"source": "  BUT!!!  If you're a pro, you'll want to spend double the money and get an L"}
{"source": " R"}
{"source": " Baggs M-80"}
{"source": "  The M-80 gives you the truest sound (unbelievable), works in passive mode, and is very easy to change the volume control"}
{"source": "  Sincerely, Doc"}
{"source": "These really do work great"}
{"source": " No more desk vibrations and the sound out of my monitors are very clear now"}
{"source": " I do only wish i could of found these in a smaller size since they are way bigger then my 5\" monitors"}
{"source": " If anyone knows where to get smaller ones let me know"}
{"source": " Thanks!"}
{"source": "The reviewer who wrote that that these are \"cheap foam\" worth $5"}
{"source": "00, doesn't understand or appreciate the quality of these speaker isolators"}
{"source": " A/B these with some $5"}
{"source": "00 cheap foam and you will realize how good these Auralex isolators work"}
{"source": " I am using a pair of Behringer Truth active speakers that weigh 33 pounds each"}
{"source": " These isolators not only support them very well but solved a big problem I had"}
{"source": " It seems my speakers were \"audio coupling\" with the console they were placed on making the console vibrate with the spaekers and muddy up the lower fequencies"}
{"source": "My problem started when I noticed that my mixes sounded good on other systems except for the bass frequencies around 80-125 HZ"}
{"source": " Apparently my Behringer speakers were not accurately reproducing that fequency range and I was EQing that range badly to compensate"}
{"source": " I didn't hear it when I mixed my Hafler M-1 speakers"}
{"source": " I was about to give up on the Behringer Truth speakers but I really thought that they sounded excellent on every other frequency and are very detailed in every other range"}
{"source": " The Behringers also had all the power I needed (active speakers) and can be played really loud in my studio without any distortion"}
{"source": " Except for what I can only describe as a muddy or not clearly detailed low end, I love these speakers"}
{"source": " Fortunately I was at a friends studio (a great pro studio) and I saw that he was using the Auralex Isolators under his speakers"}
{"source": " He said he loved them"}
{"source": " I bought them and placed them under my speakers and remixed a project I had been working on"}
{"source": " WOW!! What a difference"}
{"source": " It was an immediate difference"}
{"source": " The bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there"}
{"source": " I had to reajust the EQ on the lower frequencies (cut them back to almost flat)on the new mix"}
{"source": " I immediately bought a 2nd set for my small Hafler speakers"}
{"source": " Why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately"}
{"source": " These isolators are a great product and problem solver that saved me from buying new speakers and discovering that I still had the same problem"}
{"source": " \"Cheap foam\"?? I don't think so"}
{"source": "These strings are very bright and full"}
{"source": "  They sound great for a couple of weeks and then get a bit dead"}
{"source": "  I haven't had any problems with breakage, just a loss of tone over time (seems faster than some other strings I've tried)"}
{"source": "As a guitarist who's had the opportunity to work at Guitar Center (back in 1999), trying each type of string on the market was a fairly inexpensive and easy task"}
{"source": "  While I'll chose D'Addario EXL's for electric, Martin SP are my top choice for acoustic"}
{"source": "  The sound and reliability are unmatched for the money"}
{"source": "  They also have a neat bronze shimmer to them"}
{"source": "  Granted that's only aesthetic"}
{"source": "Martin makes a variety of good sounding strings, and these are toward the light end"}
{"source": "  The sound is bright, but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asMartin MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, Light-Medium"}
{"source": "The custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them, but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the Light-Medium"}
{"source": " Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics"}
{"source": " If you strum harder, they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent, changing the tone for the same reason a \"bend\" would"}
{"source": " If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one"}
{"source": "On the other hand, compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound, the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good"}
{"source": "Depending on your style, these might be a good choice"}
{"source": " If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable, these might seem more at home"}
{"source": "  If you are used to Martin medium strings, but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things, you might like these too, but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings, you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one"}
{"source": "I wouldn't say I dislike these, and I wouldn't quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them, because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs"}
{"source": " But as an all around choice, there are better sounding ones from Martin"}
{"source": " But it's a moot point if you don't feel comfortable playing them"}
{"source": " Make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique"}
{"source": "I bought these a while ago but just got around to using them last week"}
{"source": " I don't ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are"}
{"source": " To me it looks weird but they sound so much better than my ancient strings that were on there"}
{"source": "Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much"}
{"source": " Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings"}
{"source": " So when my strings wear out, I got this"}
{"source": " Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer"}
{"source": " Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls"}
{"source": "Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar"}
{"source": " If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string"}
{"source": "They work as well as any Dunlop pick; they don't crack, which is a big plus if you use the general Fender variety"}
{"source": "  I go a little thicker than I would for regular plastic picks, because they get flimsy after a while"}
{"source": "  Take note of the price of the picks and the shipping cost - it might be cheaper for you just to go to your nearest music store"}
{"source": "I think Tortex / Delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by"}
{"source": "Durable, good to gripping surface, easy to identify thicknesses by color"}
{"source": "The only way I can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing"}
{"source": "Then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better"}
{"source": "Take a look at \"Cactus Picks\" to get an idea of what I mean"}
{"source": "Yes"}
{"source": "  The 1"}
{"source": "0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack"}

{"source": "Whatever size you are looking for Dunlop is the best option"}
{"source": " It lasts long, sounds great, and feels very nice"}
{"source": " It is probably the most favored pick among all companies"}
{"source": " I recommend the orange one for beginners, and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well, but it is totally up to what you want"}
{"source": " Either way, Dunlop is the best and for a great price"}

{"source": " I played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time"}
{"source": " I recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock (I have an old Ibanez and a Les Paul Custom) and have tried several picks in that quest"}
{"source": " There are several I have liked (and several that I haven't) but thus far my favorite is the 1"}
{"source": "0mm Tortex (blue) picks"}
{"source": " They have a very nice, almost powdery, matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just don't break, though the 1"}
{"source": "0s are fairly stiff"}
{"source": " Depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available, and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences"}
{"source": " I won't say that I will never try anything else, but thus far I find myself picking up my 1"}
{"source": "0 Tortex more than other picks"}
{"source": "I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less \"clicky\" - than a standard plastic pick"}
{"source": "  My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these"}
{"source": "  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same, I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point, so I use them more"}
{"source": "  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent"}
{"source": "  They're almost impossible to drop, they sound and feel just right to me, and they last seemingly forever"}
{"source": "  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks"}
{"source": "I can't hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them"}
{"source": " better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast"}
{"source": "Ever since I started playing the guitar, I've used the nylon Dunlop picks"}
{"source": " They're better in a thicker size (1"}
{"source": "0mm or larger) but the "}
{"source": "73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick"}
{"source": " They're flexible and easy to pick with, but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break"}
{"source": " You'd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears"}
{"source": "Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- don't pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them, as you can get them at your local music store for about that"}
{"source": "They're very thin nylon picks"}
{"source": " They're good for practicing the hand motions of strumming; they put up very little resistance, so they train you to keep your hand stable"}
{"source": " I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone, but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums"}
{"source": " I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking, since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you don't notice with a thicker pick"}
{"source": "They're great for what they are (thin, flexible picks), and Amazon has the best price"}
{"source": "These just don't have the right feel and the sound isn't that great compared to other materials"}
{"source": "The quality control is so so"}
{"source": " The picks aren't cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them"}
{"source": "I'll stick with Dunlop Gator Grip "}

{"source": "73's are perfect"}
{"source": " They are flexible, but not flimsy"}
{"source": " The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks"}
{"source": " I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip"}
{"source": " However, they're definitely still usable after that"}
{"source": " One other advantage these picks have is that they never break"}
{"source": " So, i dont see how you can go wrong"}
{"source": "These Dunlop 88 mm picks are the right size, not to big or too small"}
{"source": "  Been using these for years"}
{"source": "  Always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases"}
{"source": "  They never wear out"}

{"source": "38mm a try"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately,  the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar (especially in an outdoor picnic setting),  and basically unusable for that purpose"}
{"source": "  However, I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice, allowing me to hear a  metronome or backtrack far easier"}
{"source": "  So although they failed my original performance intention, 5 stars for filling a need I didn't even know I had"}
{"source": "  :)"}
{"source": "This nylon pick has great play feel"}
{"source": "  It is stiff enough to pick individual strings and still feels comfortable stumming chords"}
{"source": "I'm not sure what else to say"}
{"source": " The picks work well and they don't wear out easily"}
{"source": " I like these because they have a nice grip and when my fingers get sweaty they don't slide out"}
{"source": "The "}
{"source": "6 MM pick has just the right amount of flexibility without flapping around like thinner picks"}
{"source": " And the dunlop nylon standard is my first choice for mountain dulcimer playing"}
{"source": " I know people use yogurt containers, credit cards, bird feathers and even coffee stirrers for picks, but for me, the consistency of the Dunlop pick can't be beaten"}
{"source": " And the price is right, too!"}
{"source": "I only use Dunlops"}
{"source": " For a number of reasons"}
{"source": " First, the texture of the plastic gives a good sound, and easier to hold on to"}
{"source": " Second, the \"grippy\" texture they put on them makes them easier to hold on to"}
{"source": " Thirdly, they make many sizes, for all the right occasions"}

{"source": "As a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree, we all have experienced the search for the personal Holy Grail of guitar picks"}
{"source": "  I am no exception"}
{"source": "  Dozens and dozens of makers, styles, shapes, gages,  materials,  price ranges, (oh ya, the 30 dollar picks), you name it, I've tried it (even nail picking on metal strings)"}
{"source": "  Now if you are new to the &#34;perfect pick quest&#34;, you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent, with personal grip, sound interaction, a host of music ingredients making your Grail different"}
{"source": "  However, if you play a light metal-string acoustic (my main is an Aria AF tenor guitar), check out these Dunlops "}
{"source": "60 Nylons"}
{"source": "Even within the Dunlop line, I have tried the different grips and thickness gages, and after all said and done, these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice"}
{"source": "  Just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb, light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings, just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing"}
{"source": "  Even the Dunlop Nylon Max grip of the same "}
{"source": "60 gage didn't acoustically perform quite the same"}
{"source": "Would I try another pick if the chance was presented?  Sure, most of us would since the quest for the Holy Grail never truly ends,  but until then, Dunlop's "}
{"source": "60 Nylon is without hesitation the closest thing I have gotten to pick perfection"}
{"source": "I think many/most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try"}
{"source": "  My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - they're nylon picks that have a raspy \"cat's tongue\" surface that makes it super easy to grip"}
{"source": "I've also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit, but they're not my favorite"}
{"source": "  I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic"}
{"source": "  These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them"}
{"source": "  Sound-wise I don't find that they're significantly different from any other pick"}
{"source": "  If they ever stop making Brain Picks these could very well become my #1"}
{"source": "This pick is great for strumming"}
{"source": " Some people are complaining about the grip but they are better than celluloid picks in that regard"}
{"source": " If you are looking for the best grip you need to find a pick that has a textured grip"}
{"source": "Since they were named &#34;Gator Grip&#34; I expected them to have a good gripping surface"}
{"source": "  That was not the case"}
{"source": "  The entire material and holding surface is the same material"}
{"source": "  Also they weren't as large as I expected"}
{"source": "  They are still usable as decent picks"}
{"source": "I started doing a lot of fingerstyle guitar playing, and it seems to have made my fingertips slick"}
{"source": "  So I have a hard time holding on to picks (when I use them) on upstrokes"}
{"source": "  I'm sure I could improve my technique and fix the problem, but it's more fun to blame the pick!  These picks were no different from picks without the &#34;gator grip&#34; IMHO"}
{"source": "  But Gorilla Snot worked beautifully"}
{"source": "First, I love these picks and used them exclusively for years"}
{"source": "  I have dozens of them, they never wear out"}
{"source": "  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band, and never had any issues"}
{"source": "  They are very comfortable, and easy to control"}
{"source": "Now the bad: the sound"}
{"source": "  Not the sound of the plucked not itself, but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable \"plinking\" sound that is audible through your amp"}
{"source": "  If all you're playing is loud music, this may not be an issue"}
{"source": "  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics, because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me"}
{"source": "So, too bad"}
{"source": "  I think these are great picks, but I'd like them to be made of a softer material"}
{"source": "So, these picks are really nice, but the picture is not what you will get"}
{"source": "  These picks are translucent purple"}
{"source": "  Other than the strange color, they are good picks"}
{"source": "  They really do help with speed and accuracy"}
{"source": "  Great for mandolin playing"}
{"source": "Updated: Amazon has changed the image for this item, so now the picture really does show what you will get"}
{"source": "These  picks  R awsome!  I have tremmors  in my  hands  and have a hard thime with pick control"}
{"source": "They Have a Gell  center,  Whitch  tingles,  It feels like muscles are activating in Your Hand  GREAT THERAPUTIC PICKI seem to do better with controll picks rather then ordinary picks"}
{"source": "These  picks have a indentation so U know where put UR thumb and index fingerThey really Do what they say"}
{"source": "If U have hand problems,  try these"}
{"source": "they really work"}
{"source": "The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one (no pun intended) you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice"}
{"source": "  I've used many different types of picks over the years and I've not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far it's just a case of getting used to it"}
{"source": "  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat, stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face"}
{"source": "  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard"}
{"source": "  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing"}
{"source": "  For me though, I'll keep this among my collection of picks for use but it's not my default or preferred choice for play"}
{"source": "If you're worried that the 3"}
{"source": "0 mm is too big for your guitar, you're probably right"}
{"source": "If you don't use a pick for your bass, then you don't want this either"}
{"source": "But if you want to pick your bass, this is the plectrum for you!"}
{"source": "When I first got them, I thought that they were going to be cheap, as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging, but it was ok, I wasn't expecting much from them"}
{"source": " The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material"}
{"source": " They did not bend at all when I tried to (and believe, me I tried)"}
{"source": " Pick wearing is virtually non-existent, and I utilize Alt-Picking a lot in my practices"}
{"source": " I actually learned my first sweep shred (D major) with these picks within a day of getting them"}
{"source": "I highly recommend for the shred guitarist"}
{"source": "My only complaint, is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do (becuase of the grip) but i got used to it rather quickly"}
{"source": "IMPORTANT!!!You can get these in 24 packs at ["}
{"source": "] for only $10!!! Free shipping as well!Sorry, Amazon, but that is just to good a deal to pass on"}
{"source": "These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone"}
{"source": "Unfortunately, these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability"}
{"source": "  They wear down fast"}
{"source": "  Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I don't think I play particularly hard"}
{"source": "  At around $4"}
{"source": "50 for six picks, these are some expensive pieces of plastic"}
{"source": "However, these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra"}
{"source": "  I will definitely be buying more"}
{"source": "I first want to mention that this is a pack of 6 picks"}
{"source": " The product description didn't mention that, but I was pleased to receive more than three!My son told me he needed some new picks, and since lately he's been playing Ozzy Osbourne songs I knew he needed a better pick than the standard Fender picks he's been playing with for three years"}
{"source": " After hearing him play with these picks, I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these"}
{"source": " The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level"}
{"source": " My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks"}
{"source": " I wish we could choose the color, or maybe they could send a color assortment"}
{"source": " We'll be buying these for a long time to come"}
{"source": "another item never received but i would not use anything over "}
{"source": "88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase"}
{"source": "I bought these wanting to try the nylon Big Stubby but was sent the lexan /clear purple ones instead"}
{"source": " I wanted to mention this because the item description is vague(PLYS PK) and the item pictured is nylon"}
{"source": " I'm still happy with the purchase these have the same picking dynamics as the Jazz Stubby but they give you a much larger surface to grip"}
{"source": "They are half the size of a regular pick"}
{"source": "  Bit too thick for me"}
{"source": "  Sound nice"}
{"source": " Will last forever"}
{"source": " Wish I had sized them before I bought them"}
{"source": "I bought these and used them for a week before giving my review"}
{"source": "If Amazon used half-stars, I would have given them 3"}
{"source": "5/5"}
{"source": " I just couldn't bring myself to give them a 4/5 so I went with 3/5, here's why:I've used standard medium picks for over 20 years"}
{"source": " Switching to these was not a problem at all"}
{"source": " Sure, they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems"}
{"source": " By far the biggest change was the &#34;pointy-ness&#34; of the picks"}
{"source": " The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing, especially when playing chords"}
{"source": " Everything is much more pronounced, which isn't necessarily a good thing in my opinion"}
{"source": " It's especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming)"}
{"source": "If someone was to ask me if these are good picks, my answer would be &#34;it depends"}
{"source": "&#34; It really does, in my opinion, it depends on what you're playing"}
{"source": " From a rhythm standpoint, I don't like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me"}
{"source": " For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through"}
{"source": "Could I play faster with them? No"}
{"source": " Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldn't do with my normal picks? No"}
{"source": "I tried them, but didn't like them"}
{"source": " Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work, constantly, these would be the way to go"}
{"source": " I don't, and they aren't for me"}
{"source": " I'm glad I tried them, though, because I'll never wonder again if they were for me"}
{"source": "I tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably"}
{"source": " In fact, they were so good that I purchased ten more when I went back to the same music store"}
{"source": " My favorites are mandolin picks like Golden Gate or Grisman \"Dawgs\""}
{"source": " The round side of the XH Dunlop Gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone"}
{"source": " I would recommend these to anyone"}
{"source": "If for some reason you're looking for a pick with a specific color, this is a nice set"}
{"source": " The bright colors make them difficult to lose"}
{"source": "If you can't find a container and add your own sponge, then buy this"}
{"source": "Keeping a valuable guitar humidified is essential"}
{"source": "I think this item should cost three bucks at most, and $1"}
{"source": "50 would still yield a healthy profit!I made some more from stuff from the dollar which I think are better"}
{"source": "I use this one for my baritone uke, and the bigger ones I made I use in my dreadnaughts"}
{"source": "If you make your own, just make sure to not let the sponge drip, ie, wring it out, and make sure it does not actually touch any bare wood"}
{"source": "Planet Waves humidifiers are simple to use and a great product to guard against drying your guitar and causing splitting"}
{"source": " Dampen the sponge, squeeze out excess water, insert the sponge into the holder and the holder between hte strings"}
{"source": " Check on it every few days and keep the sponge damp"}
{"source": " Couldn't be any easier"}
{"source": " I use them all winter long in my guitars"}
{"source": "It's nothing special"}
{"source": "  No frills, just a simple concept that works"}
{"source": "  It's important to maintain humidity in your instrument, especially in a dry climate like west Texas"}
{"source": "  The evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument"}
{"source": "So, when you first start using it, you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist"}
{"source": "This compact humidifier is easily filled with an included plastic syringe"}
{"source": "  If you don't over-fill, it will not drip, and you can simply place it in your case instead of the usual sponge"}
{"source": "I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier"}
{"source": "It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer"}
{"source": "The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%"}
{"source": "This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier"}
{"source": " Makes the whole house safer for the Martins"}
{"source": "Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity, but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system"}
{"source": "A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too"}
{"source": " Just don't get water on the wood"}
{"source": "And don't forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case"}
{"source": " Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case"}
{"source": "All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms"}
{"source": "I thought I would throw my two-cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier"}
{"source": "After making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge, I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck & headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas, especially the body where it is needed the most"}
{"source": "Even though I was getting acceptable humidification in the case I was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so I went ahead and splurged the 8 bucks on these"}
{"source": " (I actually bought three of them"}
{"source": ")I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer, keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet"}
{"source": " The humidity drops quite low, but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them"}
{"source": " lol"}
{"source": "Two great tips in one:Use a regular, more dense sponge, thicker like the ones at the dollar store"}
{"source": " Cut them to size and stuff them in!Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and don't worry about distilled water, unless you want to"}
{"source": " I can't argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets, but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size, and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced"}
{"source": "Don't worry about the &#34;thing&#34; hanging in-between your strings"}
{"source": " It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks"}
{"source": " I will either squeeze the excess water out, or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it won't drip"}
{"source": "The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole"}
{"source": "If you ARE rough, careless, thoughtless, or stupid, you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out, but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen"}
{"source": " This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause"}
{"source": "The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover"}
{"source": " The sponge inside is quite small, and there isn't too much room for a much larger sponge"}
{"source": " The device is simple and fairly solid"}
{"source": " Treat it gently and it will last forever"}
{"source": " You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher"}
{"source": " If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills, I'm sure it would be a decade before anything &#34;built up&#34; to require extensive cleaning or replacement"}
{"source": "Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge"}
{"source": "Try to keep the sponge moist when it's dry"}
{"source": "I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier, (or similar) mini sized about 1&#34; X 4&#34; costing around 17-20 bucks"}
{"source": "This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case"}
{"source": "Remember, too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp"}
{"source": " Too dry and it will shrink and crack, split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry, you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your 'baby ain't thirsty', or worse"}
{"source": "dead & broken!Hope this helps!"}
{"source": "I wish it was a little longer lasting but it does do the trick"}
{"source": " My guitar would probably not be happy without it"}
{"source": "This is a upgraded version of the guitar humdifier, The first one had that green stuff that florists use in it and you used a plastic syringe to ad water to it"}
{"source": " This has a replaceable sponge, you take it out, soak it and squeeze out excess then put it back in container, would say it gets more humidity out"}
{"source": "This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole"}
{"source": "  It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele"}
{"source": "  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge"}
{"source": "  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while"}
{"source": "  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides"}
{"source": "  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly"}
{"source": "  Don't push it all the way in after moistening and you won't have a problem"}
{"source": "  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge, squeeze out any excess, and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole"}
{"source": "  They can't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings"}
{"source": "  I've never had one of these move from where I left it"}
{"source": "If the sponge isn't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case"}
{"source": "  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isn't opened"}
{"source": "  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days"}
{"source": "If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or don't want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars)"}
{"source": "  Air conditioning can do the same"}

{"source": "  My wife uses on her 6-string acoustic and electric guitars"}
{"source": "  We keep a can in every case!"}
{"source": "There's not much to say about this product, except that it works"}
{"source": " It makes my strings last longer"}
{"source": " Sometimes I get lazy owning so many guitars, and 20 minutes per &#34;well done&#34; restring adds up"}
{"source": " This is a great way to put that off and keep jamming for as long as possible"}
{"source": " It's small and conveniently stored too"}
{"source": " I recommend trying it out!"}
{"source": "I am in agreement with others that state this is a must-have"}
{"source": " I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard"}
{"source": " This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood"}
{"source": " I've used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard"}
{"source": " I rub the entire neck down before and after I play"}
{"source": " It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop, which I suspect is what they must've been using all these years and never told me, though I never did ask"}
{"source": "foolish me"}
{"source": " Since I've recently gotten into doing my own setups, where I've read many forums and posters have recommended this and I figured what the heck, it's less than $5"}
{"source": "I discovered this string lubricant many years ago and I concur with what most of the reviewers here have said about it although I wouldn't call it a string cleaner although you indirectly clean the strings if you use the cloth and like another reviewer stated you should also use the cloth to clean the undersides of your strings as well"}
{"source": "  I unfortunately live in a very humid climate being only a little above the equator and so strings have a very short life here and so anything that can prolong their life is a real boon for a musician here"}
{"source": "  I agree that the only downside is the inability to tell in advance that you are running low on lubricant until it actually turns dry but I guess given the price and the overall usefulness of this accessory, one cannot complain too much"}
{"source": "  Now that mine has just run dry I'm going to delay a replacement purchase while I try out something new that I've just discovered called \"The Swipe\" which enables me to clean both the undersides and the topsides of my strings without chemicals"}

{"source": " This stuff honestly works very well"}
{"source": "  It is part of my regular arsenal"}
{"source": "I have been using GHS Fast fret for over six years and it's amazing stuff, I apply just a tiny amount to the strings before I play and then wipe them down afterwards, I used to change strings every one to two months and now strings can last me a year"}
{"source": " It's easy to control home much you put on and one can of this stuff lasts me a year or two, there isn't really any reason to just soak everything with it I don't think, I mainly use it to clean the strings"}
{"source": " I'm really glad I found this stuff!"}
{"source": "This product is not what it seems"}
{"source": " It has a cool name, but that's about it"}
{"source": " It's a tool oil that stinks"}
{"source": " I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time"}
{"source": " After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook"}
{"source": " Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty"}
{"source": " I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me"}
{"source": " You will too"}
{"source": "I agree with all of the reviews, but have found another area to use fast fret on: THE NUT"}

I used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around- but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and I noticed NO difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar"}
{"source": "  It says to use it before and after each session- thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar (I general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session)"}
{"source": "  I do still use this occasionally, but I would not spend money to purchase it again"}
{"source": "  Just not what I was looking for in a fret board cleaner"}
{"source": "Let's cut to the chase: this is, more or less, a tight roll of gauze soaked in mineral oil"}
{"source": "  But that's exactly what I need to clean and protect my fretboard"}
{"source": "  The lubricating feature is just a nice plus"}
{"source": "I used this on a 5string bass"}
{"source": " I liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier"}
{"source": " My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it"}
{"source": "Her reason for her opinion is simple"}
{"source": " This stuff puts out a LOT more oil (or whatever it is) than you would think"}
{"source": " This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard-earned callouses soft"}
{"source": "which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast (and did for my friend)"}
{"source": "To apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string, one string at a time"}
{"source": " I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string"}
{"source": " At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings, but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard"}
{"source": " That's ok"}
{"source": " You will need to wipe away the excess, and I'm telling you, if you accidentally get too much, that excess oil may not come off easily (didn't for me at least)"}
{"source": " Mine left little pools of oil between the frets, and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there"}
{"source": " Naturally, this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling"}
{"source": " My friend hated that part too, and I agree with her"}
{"source": " Soft callouses = no callouses"}
{"source": " This is a good product idea, and I like it in theory, and with my thick bass strings I didn't have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did"}
{"source": " Just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you"}
{"source": "It does what it says, but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers"}
{"source": "These impact pads came very fast and do their job although one of the pad I received ive already warn through in less then 3 weeks"}
{"source": "The Evans Pedal Patch will work for you great"}
{"source": " It will keep your mass drum head from gettingworn and nasty"}
{"source": "  I cheap buy and it works excellent"}
{"source": "In writing a simple review for such a simple product there's only a few concerns you should have"}
{"source": " 1"}
{"source": " Would the adhesive dry out on this and 2"}
{"source": " does it wear over time? The answer is it gets 4 stars"}
{"source": " It doesn't dry out but I had to replace mine after 5 years because it eventually wore out"}
{"source": " That's pretty good! Not perfect but pretty god!"}
{"source": "they look slick and work really good, i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so"}
{"source": "This strap kicks butt im a tall and big guy so its hard to find longer straps for cheap and baby is long if I have it to max its TO LONG that never happened to me and im 6 4 300 LBS so if your tall buy it don't waste your time with the Planet Wave ones there junk too short and the leather ends are really thin and brake after a few weeks of hard usage"}
{"source": "Very good strap"}
{"source": " Fine quality"}
{"source": " Your guitar will be fixed surely"}
{"source": " Just one thing: that strap is too big for kids"}
{"source": " So if you choose some kind of mini guitar, than you'd better to find something else"}
{"source": " Else, this is a really good choise!"}
{"source": "I needed a new strap but I didn't want to pay $20 for one"}
{"source": " I saw the ernie ball ones and decided to give it a shot"}
{"source": " I'm glad I did"}
{"source": " The strap is awesome"}
{"source": " It's very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap I've ever had"}
{"source": " It totally deserves 5 stars!"}
{"source": "I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before"}
{"source": "  It just didn't seem to want to hang on, so I went ahead and decided to buy a replacement"}
{"source": "This is what I chose, and notably, I chose it for the color, just simply because I thought a white strap would look nice on a red and white guitar"}
{"source": "So far, it's given me no problems, and it looks very nice and functions perfectly"}
{"source": "  This is a great bargain, too, since it's certainly not an expensive accessory"}
{"source": "I've always loved the ernie ball straps from playing it all the way down to your knees, all the way up to you chest the strap never fails, I've owned countless ernie ball straps and I always come back to them for the main reason, I've never had one fail! a great strap for a great price"}
{"source": "What you see is what you get"}
{"source": " It's cheap, It's basic, and It works"}
{"source": " The best thing about this synthetic product is the price, and color options!"}
{"source": "Product does what you would think"}
{"source": " I use it on my bass and haven't had a problem with it yet"}
{"source": " If you are constantly playing shows, this may not be your first choice, but if you just need something to hold your guitar or bass up, then this is it"}
{"source": " You can't beat the price"}
{"source": "This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten, and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them"}
{"source": " These straps have leather ends that hold the guitar securely, the strap itself is a step down from a seatbelt (If a seatbelt will keep me in place at high speeds this strap will keep your guitar in place at low speeds), and the length would be sufficient even if you are 7 ft"}
{"source": " tall"}
{"source": " Coming in several different colors to match any color guitar this is the only strap i will buy in the future"}
{"source": "Not a great mic, but if you need something realitively cheap, it'll do"}
{"source": "  Limited dynamic range"}
{"source": "  But, it works"}
{"source": "  Wish I'd have gotten something a little nicer though"}
{"source": "I got these mics because I am in an environment where we needed the ON/OFF toggle on the microphone and - for us - it works great"}
{"source": " These mics sound great for both normal speaking and singing in a small room"}
{"source": " They sound similar to the Shure SM58 and we use them every day"}
{"source": " They are still going strong"}
{"source": "Holy guacamole, you guys- this amp"}
{"source": "I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND"}
{"source": "Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase, then decided to try once more"}
{"source": "Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking"}
{"source": "I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it"}
{"source": " I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone"}
{"source": " Haven't cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but I'm sure it'll sound awesome too"}
{"source": "The Pignose is not the world's best travel amp, or portable amp, or practice amp"}
{"source": " It's not very good for vocals, it's inefficient, what with its 40-year old design, and it distorts way too easy"}
{"source": " There are far better amps for most purposes from Boss and others that deliver a lot more clean volume, thanks to modern class-D amp technology, and a variety of digital effects to boot"}
{"source": "BUT"}
{"source": " there is one area where the Pig prevails"}
{"source": " If you're looking for the sound of a big overdriven amp in the studio, or miked on stage, the Pignose will give you that sound for less than the cost of one good quality overdrive pedal"}
{"source": " By opening and closing the box, you can get a range of cabinet sounds from the open-back Fender to the classic Marchall sealed cab, and everything in between"}
{"source": " Frank Zappa recorded a lot of his guitar parts using nothing but his SG running into a Pignose, and he got fantastic sounds"}
{"source": "Beyond that, it's cool looking, reasonably rugged, and even has pegs that allow you to hang it from a guitar strap"}
{"source": " Every rocker needs one"}
{"source": "The previous reviews are pretty accurate, though I would add that when the Pignose cabinet is closed, it can often sound rather boxy"}
{"source": " It sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches"}
{"source": "As for using pedals with it, it will take distortion to a degree"}
{"source": " It reaches a point, if pushed too hard, at which the definition of the distortion will begin turning mushy and shrill"}
{"source": " You can use a distortion + overdrive to decent effect, especially if you are running a cleaner sounding OD like a Tube Screamer"}
{"source": " I don't think it would do so well with a Bad Monkey, for example, though, which has more dirt in the tones it produces"}
{"source": " I don't have a fuzz box (not yet, but have one on order), but I think most fuzzes will sound like crap unless you use a relatively cleaner, sweeter one like the Red Witch Fuzz God or the Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz"}
{"source": " Otherwise, you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound"}
{"source": "My wah wah, a Morley Power Wah, was almost useless with it"}
{"source": " The limited frequency response of the 5\" speaker made it sound overly throaty on cleans and when I put the boost in the shrillness would show itself again"}
{"source": "A chorus pedal sounds totally sweet on it, but a phaser, in my case, a Phase 90, just destroys the sound"}
{"source": " A flanger is also not really advisable"}
{"source": " You can use delay, just not with very rapid repeats"}
{"source": " Putting a compressor in front of your clean signal would probably make it more manageable for the Pignose' speaker"}
{"source": " I just bought a Dynacomp, but haven't tried it on the piggy"}
{"source": "This is a good cheap first amp to buy for a youngster who is just beginning their journey on guitar and for practice when you are on the road on vacation or business"}
{"source": " Once the young 'un seems dedicated, though, it is time to think about moving up to a VOX AC15C1 (note: that amp can do hard rock fine, but not high gain metal) or an ENGL Screamer"}
{"source": " I personally can't imagine recording with it, but Y guess that would depend on the engineering skills available to you"}
{"source": "Using this to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet"}
{"source": " It is holding a Shure SM57 microphone"}
{"source": "  The microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic, but I'm using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads"}
{"source": "I just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home"}
{"source": " It does the job well"}
{"source": " If you're looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio, then, it's perfect"}
{"source": " Many adjustments to get just the right position"}
{"source": " It's definitely not a performance mic, as it does feel a bit filmsy, but, you won't notice the flimsiness except for when you're adjusting it"}
{"source": " Adjusting it is a tad tedious, but, you can get a really good position with the microphone after a couple minutes"}
{"source": "I've mounted my Samson Q1U Dynamic Cardioid USB microphone to it"}
{"source": " It works well for sure"}
{"source": " Then, I attached the standard pop filter, and the microphone started tipping it over"}
{"source": " Make sure the boom is aligned with a leg extension, or it will tip over if there's too much weight"}
{"source": " Just find something semi heavy and find a way to attached it to the existing counter-weight, and it will be excellent"}
{"source": " So this mic won't play nice with your large condensers + pop filters + shockmount at the start, but, just find a good counter weight and all will be well"}
{"source": "It looks great, and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room"}
{"source": " It was a good investment, and all in all, you definitely get what you pay for"}
{"source": " If you're hesitant on attaching a lot of stuff to it, then, I would recommend shelling out a couple more dollars for a sturdier stand"}
{"source": "But atleast for me, it does the job, and does it well"}
{"source": "This mic stand will work great for mic'ing full stacks and guitar amps"}
{"source": "Some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone"}
{"source": " You should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg"}
{"source": "Just got this stand today"}
{"source": "First impressions are always important, and this stand gave me a good impression"}
{"source": "It seems to be made solid enough, not like some cheap off brand crap"}
{"source": "The base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over"}
{"source": "The telescope mechanism is quite well made"}
{"source": "Comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters"}
{"source": "I got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall"}
{"source": " It's quite the perfect height for when I'm seated on my stool"}
{"source": "One thing I did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place"}
{"source": " It unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved"}
{"source": " Maybe adding something to keep it screwed in?Would recommend to others"}
{"source": "Probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs"}
{"source": "I have quite a few mic stands, and picked this up to use for micing a guitar cabinet"}
{"source": " I love the low profile and the design of the feet - it's very sturdy, and all around better than the DR stands that I have which cost twice as much"}
{"source": " It has plenty of weight to it and enough reach to easily reach all 4 speakers in my 4x12 without becoming &#34;tippy&#34;"}
{"source": "5/5, though it would have been nice if it shipped with more than just the single cable clip"}
{"source": "Its much better than what I got with my violin"}
{"source": "  Its been good I can't really complain, considering its basically tree sap"}
{"source": "it's ok but a little cheaper quality than I expected"}
{"source": "  I would recommend going a little higher price"}
{"source": "  It also arrived cracked"}
{"source": "The rosin does the trick, and it's cased in a nice wooden holder, so it shouldn't crack easily (unlike those round rosin containers)"}
{"source": "really cool looking rosin, works well and is just overall awesome, you cant break it either becuase its in wood"}
{"source": "I got my daughter a cheap fiddle here and the rosin SUCKED big time so we got this to use instead"}
{"source": " Works well once you learn the trick of scuffing it up the first time you use it"}
{"source": " I know everybody knows this already, but I've never played with a bow before, most all my instruments use pics or at least fingers"}
{"source": "Good length but very slippery"}
{"source": "  I had my wife sew nice cotton fabric to the backside using white thread and it look better and doesn't slide around"}
{"source": "  I took sandpaper to the lightning bolt for the more faded rugged look and it is actually a very rad strap that I have been commented on a few times now"}
{"source": "  For the price, why not?  Be creative and make it original and it can be a very nice addition to a nice acoustic or electric"}
{"source": "  As far as the base product, it has gone through a lot of use and is not showing any signs of wear"}
{"source": "A perfect match for the original I replaced"}
{"source": "  These fit the American sized pots perfectly"}
{"source": "  The price at Amazon was the best I could find without buying used crap"}
{"source": "I bought this recently and I love it"}
{"source": " Why?  It has no &#34;smell&#34;, it leaves no residue on your hands, it's very &#34;light&#34; but yet it cleans, shines, and polishes your guitar beautifully"}
{"source": "  It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish, it also makes it ultra-shiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors"}
{"source": " This is fantastic stuff"}
{"source": " If you own a guitar this is the best product out there"}
{"source": " But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson"}
{"source": " I was very suprised that it was this effective"}
{"source": " This little bottle goes a long way"}
{"source": " I have already polished all of my guitars and my friend's guitars and I still have more than 1/2 a bottle left"}
{"source": " If you need to polish your guitar look no further"}
{"source": " This is your best choice"}
{"source": "This is my second condenser microphone and I have to say that I love it"}
{"source": " I previously owned an Audio Technica 2020 condenser mic which sounded thin and not as natural to me"}
{"source": " I noticed that this mic does not really boost any frequencies like some other mics do in this price range"}
{"source": " With this microphone, what you hear with your ears is basically what you get"}
{"source": " Of course, room acoustics and microphone positioning all play a large part in the final sound"}
{"source": "I use an Alesis mic preamp with a Focusrite 2i2 interface and the recordings sound clean"}
{"source": " Another thing to mention, this is a variable pattern condenser mic"}
{"source": " However, even with all the polar patterns that this mic has to offer, I usually just leave it on cardioid since I mainly use the M179 for vocals"}
{"source": " Although I usually only record vocals, I also record electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and drums with the same microphone"}
{"source": "Overall, my experience with this microphone has been pretty great"}
{"source": " I think that for this price, it will be hard to find another microphone that can perform on the same level"}
{"source": "I sent it back, probably due to my ignorance"}
{"source": "  Has multiple patterns to collect sound"}
{"source": "  Was a clear mike but I didn't detect any body to the sound"}
{"source": "  Maybe a preamp would have helped"}
{"source": "  I checked out many mikes and ended up with a Rode NT-1A which is probably similar in character"}
{"source": "  My goal was to record my voice without color and this came close"}
{"source": "  I wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars?  Suspicious ratings to me"}
{"source": "  Now that I have more experience I would be curious to check it out"}
{"source": "  But since I found a good solution I don't think it's worth the effort"}
{"source": "Ok here's the deal"}
{"source": "I'm just a small home studio type of guy, and honestly I wasn't expecting much when I shelled out the $120 for this mic"}
{"source": "  I have just always seen it around and I thought it would be a solid choice for my first multi-pattern mic!  The first time I recorded with it, I had it on omni mode and played some acoustic"}
{"source": "it sounded amazing!  I can't believe this mic is that good"}
{"source": "  Crisp, clean sound (who cares if it's made in China like that one guy says?), and very flexible usage"}
{"source": "  I've since used it on toms, acoustic, a room mic for amps, and even some background vocals, and it has shined every time!So if you're like me and looking for a low-price LDC with multiple patterns, GET THIS"}
{"source": "  You won't be disappointed at all!  :)"}
{"source": "I bought this mic after hearing good things about it, but I had never tried it"}
{"source": " It has impressed me quite a bit since then"}
{"source": " I use it in a small home studio set-up, along with a Presonus Firebox and Logic Pro on a Macbook"}
{"source": "For the price, this mic is a very good deal"}
{"source": " It sounds much better than an Audio Technica 3035 that I had (and ended up selling shortly after getting this mic)"}
{"source": " I also got an Oktava MK-319 that is a much more expensive mic, and that was then sent to be mod'ed by Michael Joly (and therefore cost even more) and I'd say the two mics are very similar"}
{"source": " I end up using the CAD M179 a lot more because it's less valuable, but sounds just as good"}
{"source": "What else? It has low noise and combines the crispness you want from a condenser without being unpleasant"}
{"source": " It sounds particularly great for male vocals, in my opinion, although I have used it for as a room drum-mic"}
{"source": " I would highly recommend this mic, especially at this price point"}
{"source": "Got mine for under 130, and it's a great Mic"}
{"source": "  I can use it for vocal tracks, or recording for webcasts that kind of thing, or recording studio guitar sounds etc"}
{"source": "  Awesome mic"}
{"source": "I've done a good bit of recording over the years"}
{"source": " This microphone has very very low self noise, low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern"}
{"source": "I've listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options"}
{"source": " This mic is outstanding, the sound of the mic simply disappears  "}
{"source": " "}
{"source": " "}
{"source": " it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail, but without hype or over brightness"}
{"source": "I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition"}
{"source": "I owned a Boss graphic eq many years ago and never really took to it"}
{"source": "  Ah, the folly of youth"}
{"source": "  First, this pedal is dirt cheap, but the build quality actually seems very solid"}
{"source": " The sliders have a nice feel to them, as does the on/off switch"}
{"source": "  If you have any tonal issues with your amp then a graphic eq is an easy solution"}
{"source": " No, it won't make you love an amp you hate, but if you're ALMOST THERE, or even just want to add some sonic variety, you won't really realize how useful and vital a graphic eq is"}
{"source": "My rig right now is a strat and jazzmaster into a Pro Jr"}
{"source": "  I love the amp, but as the volume goes up the treble gets a bit piercing"}
{"source": "  I've been able to tame that issue with this pedal"}
{"source": "  It's a subtle thing"}
{"source": " It takes some time to play around with the sliders and figure out what will really hit your amp's sweet spot - at least in my application, where I'm leaving it on all the time"}
{"source": "  This pedal would also be good for a solo boost, as it has plenty of output to make your leads punch through"}
{"source": "Overall, for this price, you can't go wrong"}
{"source": "  This is one of those pedals that has a million applications and will always have a use in my setup"}
{"source": "  I'm thinking of getting a second one and building a pedalboard specific to my acoustic rig (comp, eq, chorus, reverb)"}
{"source": "Seriously, this is a great pedal"}
{"source": " I can't improve upon what others have said, but I will mention a few points"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone, or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop"}
{"source": " It's run before time based effects (delay, phaser, etc) for me"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster, while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " If it gets noisy or \"self oscillates\" after a while, change the battery to a fresh one"}
{"source": " Better yet, use an AC adapter"}
{"source": "I found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews"}
{"source": " Otherwise, it's been on my setup for about seven years"}
{"source": " I take care of my stuff"}
{"source": "Well, just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours"}
{"source": "I still think it takes a bit of brightness on bypass but when it's on it's great! I've been thinking on using it mainly as a boost for leads but it sounds so much better with it i can't seem to turn it off!it's light, small and it looks well built but only time will tell how resistent it is but hey for 30 bucks it's a great deal!This is a good EQ for an excelent price, not an excelent EQ so i give it a 4 out of 5 and look forward to testing some others danelectro pedals"}
{"source": "Originally I purchased a Behringer EQ700 equalizer pedal for my rig"}
{"source": " It was cheap at around $20+ some change but like the other reviewers noted, it's noisy with hiss"}
{"source": " So I took the advice of another reviewer & bought the Fish & Chips model by Danaelectro and it's terrific"}
{"source": "I plugged it directly in line on my SKB pedal board, turned them both on, turned on the amp, put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max & no discernible hiss nor hum"}
{"source": " Mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable"}
{"source": "This pedal has a cool 1950's style & appearance"}
{"source": " It has a great punch when you raise up the Level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar & amp sounds"}
{"source": " For a modifying pedal, you cannot go wrong for the $30 price tag"}
{"source": " If you're in the market for a great 7 band EQ pedal, then you'll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one"}
{"source": "This product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars"}
{"source": "I been playing guitar for 12+ years now"}
{"source": " I play lead and rhythm"}
{"source": " I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high)"}
{"source": " I don't like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead"}
{"source": " A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more"}
{"source": " This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has it's own level BTW"}
{"source": "I've been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job"}
{"source": "  Yes, it could be metal, and I wish the button gave a satisfying 'click' when I step on it"}
{"source": "  For under thirty clams I can look past these things"}
{"source": "  I have not had any issues with noise (crackling or oscillation)"}
{"source": "  I really have no complaints at all with it's performance so I am glad I didn't shell out 3-4X more money so I can feel more secure when I unlatch my pedal board in front of gear-snobs"}
{"source": "  I don't think I need to run this pedal with every amp I own but it does a great job 'opening up the sound' of boxy or dark sounding amps"}
{"source": "  When I run it in the effects loop of my Palomino V8 (great little practice amp btw) that little amp sounds HUGE"}
{"source": "  Also great in front of my Blues Jr"}
{"source": "  If you own an amp with a single tone knob (Pro Jr, Valve Jr etc) or if you find your tone stack lacking responsiveness you owe it to yourself to buy one of these"}
{"source": " Even if you are satisfied with the responsiveness of your amp's controls, this pedal can double as a volume boost when playing lead"}
{"source": "  Once my sound is dialed in, I leave typically leave it on and forget about it"}
{"source": "  It's also pretty indespensible for shaping the sound of your amplified acoustic guitar-"}
{"source": "These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money"}
{"source": " I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more \"brilliance\" to the tone"}
{"source": " The case is plastic, not very attractive, and perhaps not very sturdy"}
{"source": " Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired -- it doesn't feel very solid"}
{"source": " But I intend to use this more for recording than live use, so I'm not worried about that"}
{"source": " Anyway, there aren't many EQ's on the market, and for the price, it can't be beat"}
{"source": " I would recommend it"}
{"source": "Had this for about 3 years now - it works great, and for 30 dollars, it was a heck of a bargain"}
{"source": "The construction is ok - it's plastic with a metal + rubber bottom, but seems sturdy"}
{"source": "  Battery is easy to get in and out, and comes with one (but is not shipped connected to the terminals)"}
{"source": "Signal wise, if on, it adds a tiny amount of hiss and static, which raises the noise floor by a hair"}
{"source": "  The noise isn't noticeable unless you are paying attention when turning it on or off"}
{"source": "  Besides, if you are boosting the high end, you are going to get hiss"}
{"source": "Works great in front for a clean or unclean boost, but I tend to use it in the fx loop - where it does what it's supposed to do"}
{"source": "  I think it's a must for getting the most out of an existing amp setup, especially if the amp's EQ isn't doing it for you, or the cab or speaker choice is less than optimal - this thing fixes it all!I would definitely choose this over more expensive EQs, but I tend to take good care of my stuff"}
{"source": "I have a Fender T Bucket acoustic guitar and I put heavy guage strings on it"}
{"source": " As beginner these strings were not good for me"}
{"source": " I tried these and they blow away the heavy guage strings"}
{"source": " Good quality"}
{"source": " Glad I bought these"}
{"source": "Nice overall, with a good sustained ring from the steel strings (1-2) and a bit of a metalic sound on the wound strings (3-6)"}
{"source": "  I like the sound I get on my Yamaha acoustic"}
{"source": "I read the reviews on Ernie Ball strings"}
{"source": " I have to say that I love the strings"}
{"source": " They have a rich sound that brings my acoustic alive"}
{"source": "There are something special about these strings"}
{"source": " They ring so bright and beautiful"}
{"source": " I absolutely love them for my fenders"}
{"source": " I honestly don't use them on all of my fenders but they are on my tele"}
{"source": " They're gorgeous sounding, especially when new"}
{"source": "We geetarists are a funny bunch: we'll change out pots and caps and pups from our axes and amps all day long, and spend a fortune doing it"}
{"source": " But sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks!Case in point: pure nickel strings"}
{"source": " Time was when that was all there was"}
{"source": "and gee whiz, that was a time when good guitar tone ruled"}
{"source": " Coincidence? Nope"}
{"source": " These things just sound better, if by better you mean warmer and with a subtle feel that your fingers will convey to your brain in milliseconds"}
{"source": " If you're used to wrapped strings, and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal, these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general"}
{"source": " Especially if you use tubes"}
{"source": "Tubes and pure nickel are like Gilmour and Strats or Angus and SGs"}
{"source": " They just fit"}
{"source": "I'm not nuts about Fender acoustic strings, but I like their normal electric strings fine, though Ernie Ball Slinkies have been my go-tos for many years"}
{"source": " But these Fender pure nickels are very very nice, and at 4"}
{"source": "75, they're a real deal"}
{"source": " Most pure nickels run nearer to ten, and these sound pretty much the same, and I don't seem to break many of 'em neither"}
{"source": " If you're used to mixed alloy, pure nickels might seem a little \"dull\", but wait a bit and you'll find that the harmonics are still there when the alloys have faded"}
{"source": " Plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips"}
{"source": " Try a set and see what I mean"}
{"source": " It's subtle but it's beautiful"}
{"source": "But the main reason I love these is for playing at VOLUME! I turned my modded Hot Rod Deluxe up to call-the-cops levels (the neighbors are getting used to it by now), louder than the drummer by a good chunk, and I got: less squealing, warmer tone by far, and full chords, triads and double stops that felt and sounded smoother and grinded with more harmonic warmth than any alloy string I've ever used"}
{"source": " I think there's an electrical cohesion between pure nickel and good pups and tubes that is simply sublime"}
{"source": " Check out BB's tone on the legendary Live At The Regal to hear what I mean"}
{"source": " That's the stuff"}
{"source": "So, if you haven't tried pure nickels, spend a buck or two more (or maybe less!) than you normally do and give these bargain-priced nickels a try"}
{"source": " You might find that you're a convert within seconds"}
{"source": " I know that my ears sure love them when things are really cranked up; those Zep and Jimi riffs just sound and feel so much more right with pure nickel"}
{"source": " And digging into some Otis Rush or Billy Gibbons licks is like night and day"}
{"source": " The bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels"}
{"source": "Hell of a bargain at less than five bucks"}
{"source": "You can't beat these, for the price"}
{"source": " I use them on 3 of my guitars (2 27&#34; scale baritones in A and B, and a 24"}
{"source": "75&#34; standard scale in C#)I got a 12-pack (elsewhere) for under 4 bucks a set"}
{"source": " They sound really good"}
{"source": " No breakage problems, etc"}
{"source": "This set of strings is fantastic"}
{"source": " I've been playing for over ten years now, and have tried everything from Elixirs, to D'Addario, to Martin, to John Pearse (you see where I'm going with this?)and many more"}
{"source": "I have to say that for the money, these strings are in a class of their own"}
{"source": "  When I first started playing I loved the coated strings"}
{"source": "  I wouldn't buy anything but Elixirs for years!  Then I got married and money became tight, and for $15 a pop, a set Elixirs wasn't looking as good as they used to"}
{"source": "So I tried every other set of strings under the sun for about three years"}
{"source": "I finally landed on these Earthwoods by Ernie Ball"}
{"source": "  Amazing!They are not coated, but after a while I got used to that, and now actually prefer non-coated strings"}
{"source": "These really do bring out the \"earthy\" tones of my dreadnought"}
{"source": "  And the Medium Light set is just perfect!  Nice size high E string so I don't feel like I'm going to snap it when I do a pull off, and good bass response"}
{"source": "All in all a fantastic set of strings that you can't afford not to try"}
{"source": "And at $5, why wouldn't you give them a shot?"}
{"source": "These just sound flat in comparison to Elixir Nanowebs and they don't feel as good either"}
{"source": "I guess I just prefer coated acoustic strings"}
{"source": "put them on my daughter's guitar, and she enjoys them"}
{"source": "  anything would be an improvement over the dead strings that she was playing"}
{"source": "i'll take ernies over martins, but not over d'addarios on my guitars though"}
{"source": "I have owned two of these stands"}
{"source": " The first one was rendered unusable after the set screw disappeared"}
{"source": " The second one must have walked off on its own while I was moving to a new place"}
{"source": " Not the greatest stands by any means, but for what they're worth, I didn't mind spending another $10 to get one"}
{"source": " Sure there are other stands of much higher quality that are even more compact and portable"}
{"source": " But price, ability to collapse, and it's light weight made it the one I bought"}
{"source": " again"}
{"source": "Total flimsy junk"}
{"source": " It leans WAYYY too far back"}
{"source": " I'll be damned if I put my $1000 guitars on these things"}
{"source": " On the other hand, ChromaCast makes one that's very close to this price, and I doubt that it could have been more for the money I paid"}
{"source": "In summary"}
{"source": " DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK"}
{"source": "Excellent compact guitar stand"}
{"source": " Folds so small that it easily fits in guitar case or gear bag"}
{"source": " Not as stable as some stands but for the size and price, can't be beat"}
{"source": " Thanks to Amazon for offering such a good product"}
{"source": "I love these little guitar stands"}
{"source": " They are small enough to go anywhere with you, and they are cheap enough that you can keep a couple of them around"}
{"source": " Which is good if you are as clumsy as I am"}
{"source": "The last two of these that I have owned met untimely deaths"}
{"source": " The first was on stage and since it is so small I tripped over it on the back of the stage"}
{"source": " The second one I tripped over and ended up falling off of the stage"}
{"source": " I know, I know"}
{"source": " but they really are cool little stands, and I just bought another one lol"}
{"source": " I am a glutton for punishment!"}
{"source": "The fender mini electric guitar stand is not made for the fender / Squire mini guitar"}
{"source": " the guitar falls through"}
{"source": " I will have to buy a differant stand for him, rendering this one useless"}
{"source": " The fender stand for standard guitars will not work on the 3/4 size ether"}
{"source": "I have two of these stands, the electric guitar/bass version and the acoustic version"}
{"source": " Back to buy a second electric guitar version as a spare or to keep in my guitar case"}
{"source": " Yes -- folded up it WILL fit in my tweed Fender electric guitar case alongside the neck of the guitar (I DO always keep it IN the included stand bag to ensure I don't scratch or bump it against my guitar)"}
{"source": " Great at this price too, buy several!"}
{"source": "Not your average Giant Clumsy Guitar Stand, but it works"}
{"source": " The only drawback is that it is literally not big enough to provide a very stable base of support"}
{"source": " If you have toddlers or rambunctious dogs, or even fairly large cats, a larger stand might be a better choice"}
{"source": " If your household is quiet, this is very much a good bargain"}
{"source": "I have 7 of these stands for my 7 guitars"}
{"source": " I have 4 classical guitars, 2 flamenco guitars and 1 acoustic steel string"}
{"source": "  It's very durable and easy to set up and the guitars never tip over"}
{"source": "  It's a really great, quality stand for the price"}
{"source": "  They don't take up a lot of room and they're very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if you're traveling"}
{"source": "  I highly recommend it"}
{"source": "My guitar teacher suggested that I keep my guitar(s) out because he said that if I kept it/them in a visible, easily-accesible place that I would practice more, even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right"}
{"source": "  Instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bags/cases after each practice session, I have them all out and displayed and I definitely practice and play more because as soon as I step into the room - there they are, I just pick any one of them up and start playing"}
{"source": "  It was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but I hadn't realized that I always had the excuse that I didn't have time to practice -- but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and doesn't take up a lot of time, for some reason kept me from practicing"}
{"source": "  I guess out of sight, out of mind"}
{"source": "  But now I keep my guitars out, and I also bought a music stand and I keep the music I'm working on and the stand out"}
{"source": "  Yes, it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful"}
{"source": "It was cheap to buy but works just fine"}
{"source": " I thought it might not be tall enough to hold my guitar securely but it does"}
{"source": " The arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching"}
{"source": " It is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely"}
{"source": " Perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar"}
{"source": " In that case, I would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier"}
{"source": "The these strings are fantastic"}
{"source": " The sound is deep and heavy, which is exactly what I was looking for"}
{"source": " Makes the bass sound pretty bad@$$"}
{"source": " I cranked up the bass amplifier after putting on these strings and the sound is pure, powerful, and blew me away"}
{"source": "Well worth the money"}
{"source": "Changed the strings on my Epiphone EB-0 bass today for the first time using this product"}
{"source": "Fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare"}
{"source": "  Cutter works great, winder makes the job really fast"}
{"source": "  10 minutes it took for all 4 strings"}
{"source": "  Next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended"}
{"source": "I found this tool to be convenient and better made than I anticipated, making it a solid value for the money"}
{"source": "  No need for a collection of separate tools anymore"}
{"source": "Great concept"}
{"source": "everything rolled into one product"}
{"source": "  Winder, String cutter and end pin remover"}
{"source": "  The price is fair for all that"}
{"source": "For about $8 you get a string winder, string cutter and an acoustic peg remover all-in-one"}
{"source": "What more can you ask for?Mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use"}
{"source": "I have nice wire cutters, etc (I'm an EE) but it is much easier to grab one tool instead of two or three"}
{"source": "As for quality, it has an unconditional guarantee, see above"}
{"source": "Planet Waves -aka D'Addario- is a well-known name in guitar accessories"}
{"source": "To the reviewers complaining about the tool breaking, try using your warranty instead of whining"}
{"source": "No manufacturer has a perfect run forever, but at least in this case you have not wasted your money"}
{"source": "For the record, I do not work for D'Addario / Planet Waves - but I would not dismiss a job off-hand if they offered it  ;-)"}
{"source": "Finally, a winder that has features and durability designed into it"}
{"source": "  The pocket of the winder head appears to be large enough to handle any tuning peg head size and the molded plastic body appears to be thick enough to stand up to a lot of use"}
{"source": "  The pivot point doesn't bind when using the winder as has a couple other cheaper models I've purchased (and thrown away) over the years"}
{"source": "  The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated, works well regardless of string composition type,"}
{"source": "stainless, chromes, core-types, etc"}
{"source": "  The price seems fair enough"}
{"source": "  I've seen a couple of battery powered models for not much more money, but if you're in that big a hurry to change strings you're living life too fast"}
{"source": " get a 'roadie' to do it for you"}
{"source": " why have to remember to carry spare batteries"}
{"source": "Stripped down one of my basses at the weekend, found this very useful, made stripping and replacing strings really easy"}
{"source": " Large enough to fit the fender tuners"}
{"source": " Have 2 new sets of strings on order so fitting them won't be as daunting a task as without this item"}
{"source": "I bought this mainly for the string cutter, although it has a peg winder and a bridge pin puller as well"}
{"source": " At first I was skeptical because it's lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp"}
{"source": " I was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings"}
{"source": " I'm happy to say that it does an excellent job, much better than the pair of diagonal pliers I was using"}
{"source": "  It cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly"}
{"source": "  It's nice not having to carry the pliers around, which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock"}
{"source": " As for the bridge pin puller, I tried it once but it is rather ineffective"}
{"source": " I think it was included more as an afterthought as it's just a notched edge and can't really pull stuck pins"}
{"source": " For pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge I would recommend the Dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive"}
{"source": "Overall I give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter"}
{"source": " I'd recommend this to any acoustic guitarist as an essential tool to keep in their guitar case"}
{"source": "It beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet, but it could be better"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " It slips off if you go too fast, but I thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " It didn't come with much of any instructions, so I was using it wrong at first"}
{"source": " There is a big and a small slot"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use"}
{"source": " The cutter works great, you just have to be careful"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " The screw that holds it on keeps coming loose"}
{"source": " Sure I can tighten it, but it just means the design could be better"}
{"source": "All and all it's one of those must have gadgets, but it does require a little discipline to master"}
{"source": " I hope the next version comes with a soft, rubber insert so it doesn't scratch the chrome off my turner pegs"}
{"source": " That and maybe they could use a long screw and some Loctite to keep it from coming loose"}
{"source": " And well, maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find"}
{"source": " Everything I have seems to be jet black"}
{"source": "The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design"}
{"source": " It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job"}
{"source": "My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item"}
{"source": " The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item"}
{"source": " If you need an additional item on an order from this seller you need to check the shipping cost or you will not be getting the good price advertised for the item and may consider purchasing it elsewhere"}
{"source": "I've had string winders for years, but never a multifunction one like this"}
{"source": " I recently bought it for my niece, and taught her how to change her strings"}
{"source": "The different size gaps make it 'grab' the tuning pegs much better than my old one"}
{"source": " I was able to use it on an electric, steel string acoustic, and classical, and it grabbed them all rather well"}
{"source": " The string cutter works well, and the peg puller does also"}
{"source": " So handy!"}
{"source": "I honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all"}
{"source": " First, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick"}
{"source": " And as for the winder"}
{"source": " I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner"}
{"source": " But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit"}
{"source": " Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help"}
{"source": " Didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing"}
{"source": " Just looked at it"}
{"source": " guess that notch in the peg winder is it"}
{"source": "Each time I have set out to use it, I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string"}
{"source": " I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters & Needle-Nose Pliers Set(the pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding)"}
{"source": " When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, I'll try the notch bridge peg puller"}
{"source": " But other wise, this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;"}
{"source": "I like Dunlop products but"}
{"source": " The push down applicators (Dunlop's Dab-O-Matic Applicator Tops) are horrible idea"}
{"source": " One popped right off the other day and oil got all over the place"}
{"source": " I will not buy these again or I will remove them and just use a cloth"}
{"source": "Everything from the string cleaner to the polish works very well"}
{"source": "You have to be very careful with the fretboard cleaner because it will dry out the fretboard but the conditioner is included and can be applied after"}
{"source": "The string cleaner does not really leave much residue and really does help with string noise"}
{"source": "You wont be let down"}
{"source": "Dunlop makes good quality products"}
{"source": "I love this system"}
{"source": "  Every time I change strings now, I go through every step of this system, and what a difference it has made"}
{"source": "  The fretboard cleaner and conditioner are great"}
{"source": "  I never realized how dry the wood was"}
{"source": "  The string cleaner is nice too"}
{"source": "  I feel like I was neglecting my guitars until I got this"}
{"source": "  The quantities of product in this kit are good, and the instructions are clear"}
{"source": "  The two polishing cloths are adequate size, and washable"}
{"source": "I hate string noise and a dirty acoustic"}
{"source": " This kit covers all the bases from the fret board to the body"}
{"source": " My favorite acoustic guitar is over 40 years old and it looks like a brand new guitar and no annoying string noise when I am changing chords or fingering the fret-board"}
{"source": "Unfortunately, the first one of these I ordered from Amazon arrived with two of the bottles having leaked their contents all over the place"}
{"source": " Take two! The second set I received was in great condition, and I'm really surprised with the amount of product you get for the low cost"}
{"source": " This kit literally has everything you will need (except new strings of course"}
{"source": ") to keep your guitar looking and sounding great"}
{"source": "Granted, I'm no expert on what's out there in the world for guitar cleaning materials"}
{"source": " This is my first foray into that world"}
{"source": "But, I've used it, and it's easy"}
{"source": " The polish is great, the cloths are soft and just what they should be; the wax is wonderfully shiny and easy to put on and buff"}
{"source": " Everything here is, as far as I can tell, just as advertised - a way to keep one's instruments in good shape"}
{"source": "I now have a shine on my guitar that is better than when it arrived from the factory, and there doesn't seem to be any chemicals in the stuff that corrodes or otherwise destroys the guitar, like perhaps some fly-by-night cheapy cheapy product maker might offer"}
{"source": "Maybe there are better polishes and waxes out there - and knowing the way the world works, I'm sure there are some, probably made out of rare elephant glandular excretions that sell for $500 a bottle that the pros use and maybe would be worth 6 or 7 stars on the Amazon review"}
{"source": " I don't know"}
{"source": " But come on; this stuff is just fine"}
{"source": "In general it's OK but when you look at the fine writing on the fingerboard formula it says not to use on Maple; which means I can't use it on either of my Gibsons"}
{"source": "  Probably better to just get the lemon oil for that separately"}
{"source": "The products work great, applied them to my new Les Paul Ukulele for protection"}
{"source": " The strings that came with my ukulele were junk so I decided to replace them with aquila strings"}
{"source": " Prior to doing so I decided that I would like to prep the fret board"}
{"source": " The frets seemed a little rough and the rosewood looked a little dry to me so"}
{"source": "I ordered this kit to see what it would do"}
{"source": " It comes with both fret board cleaner and even a very fine grit emery cloth for the metal frets"}
{"source": " I thought I would try the emery cloth on the frets and was very pleased with the results"}
{"source": " The frets are now very smooth and shiny and the rosewood fret board looks like it is much happier after a little drink"}
{"source": "The polish for the instrument brought out a deep luster"}
{"source": "but remember a little goes a long way so the wax should last a very long time as I am sure the other products will too"}
{"source": "The cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument"}
{"source": " Mine came soaked due to the 02 bottle leaking upon arrival"}
{"source": " That is the reason I did not give this product a 5 star"}
{"source": " It looked like the package was damaged prior to shipment since the out side package was pristine and the product was protected well inside with adequate padding"}
{"source": "I am now going to work on my Gibson Les Paul Custom Guitar and I am sure that I will be very happy with the results!Great product which would deserve the full 5 stars if it was packaged a little better"}
{"source": "This kit cleans strings body and conditions the fretboard"}
{"source": " It's got everything you need for your high end guitar maintenance"}
{"source": "Take some time but it was well worth it"}
{"source": "  I've always cleaned the finger boards with rubbing alcohol then used linseed oil afterwards"}
{"source": "  This worked great and the guitars buffed up like never before!"}
{"source": "got a cleaner/polish/wax type ointment for every part of your guitar"}
{"source": " comes with a small rag, and fret polishing pad deal"}
{"source": "the fret pad is great and I didn't know about this type of thing till getting this kit"}
{"source": " also comes with a step by step/stage by stage instruction pamphlet"}
{"source": " worth it to get this kit and replace /add to it as needed"}
{"source": "The Dunlop Guitar Fingerboard Kit arrived very quickly and was put to the test immediately"}
{"source": "  I am pleased with the product"}
{"source": "  It makes my guitar look new again"}
{"source": "  I will definitly look into their other products"}
{"source": "  Thanks to Amazon for the quick service"}
{"source": "Nice little kit"}
{"source": " it has 800 grit sandpaper in it, I hadn't noticed that in the listing, maybe I overlooked it"}
{"source": " I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade"}
{"source": " The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me"}
{"source": "I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board"}
{"source": " Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible"}
{"source": " I was miserable, my guitar sounded like s***"}
{"source": "After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bob's your uncle, good as new"}
{"source": " I'm going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars"}
{"source": "Nice little kit, I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days"}
{"source": " Works a charm on acoustic guitars, haven't tried it on the electric guitars yet"}
{"source": "This product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar"}
{"source": " My fretboard hasn't been cleaned/oiled in 15 years so it was extremely dry"}
{"source": " The cleaner removed visible grime, the polish cloth shined up the frets, but most importantly, the oil returned the fretboard to a deep beautiful color and feel"}
{"source": " I am very pleased with the product"}
{"source": "I have used Ernie Ball strings for along time"}
{"source": "  Mostly slinky's or super slinky's"}
{"source": "  I read the review on these and thought I would give these a try for the sound they make paired with a LP"}
{"source": "I bought these to replace the stockers on the EPI LP 100 I just bought"}
{"source": "  Luckily I order two packs"}
{"source": "  I was putting on the top E string and had turned the crank less than a few times, not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet, and \"pop\" it broke"}
{"source": " I had ordered two sets, so I put on the one from the new set"}
{"source": " No problems until I got to the G string, then \"pop\" another breaker"}
{"source": " Very sad quality"}
{"source": "After finally getting them on and in tune (you will need to stretch the top 3 strings alot to get them to stay in tune, especially the E) I have to say they have a great sound to them"}
{"source": "  Nice tone and sustain"}
{"source": "  Great crucnhy sound for metal, but still a good clean tone too"}
{"source": "  These are thick strings, but still bendable, just not very far"}
{"source": "  I would rate the sound 5 stars"}
{"source": "Unfortunately, it takes two packs of strings for one successful stringing to occur because of how brittle the strings are"}
{"source": "  So I have to give these three stars overall"}
{"source": "Tried a heavier gauge string for playing slide guitar on my S"}
{"source": "G"}
{"source": " It worked out perfectly "}
{"source": " I am 66 years old and have been playing Guitar for over fifty years"}
{"source": " Of course over the years I've tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings "}
{"source": " There are no surprises"}
{"source": " The quality Is always the same"}
{"source": " Also, I believe the very best value for the dollar"}
{"source": " From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings , You just can't go wrong"}
{"source": " I am a fairly new Amazon customer and am finding out that that all important trust factor is there and have no hesitation on my part in shopping with them"}
{"source": "I use earnie ball strings as my backup strings"}
{"source": " They don't have as nice and clear a tone as my d'addario or curt mangan strings, nor do they have the life expectancy, however they are cheaper and really easy to bend"}
{"source": " Since I can't afford to restring with the more pricey strings every single time, I go with these when I'm practicing"}
{"source": " They do break alot when I play some crazy solos, which blows, and is the main reason why I'm not giving them 5s"}
{"source": " (No it's not my technique, I've never broken a string on any other brand strings I've tried"}
{"source": ") When I'm in the studio recording, I prefer, like I said before, D'addario or curt mangan strings, however to save money, I practice with these strings and I think it's not a bad method, as I go through strings like doritos (I eat doritos alot)"}
{"source": "This isn't a review of these strings so much as a warning or caveat for those of you playing guitars with floating bridges (usually for a whammy bar) and not using these heavier strings already"}
{"source": "I wanted a little fuller sound than the 10-46 slinky strings (aka regular slinky) and the idea of some driving base appealed to me so ordered the beefy's"}
{"source": " I strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar"}
{"source": " Every time I got the higher strings in tune, the lowers would go down as much as a half note"}
{"source": " It took awhile to realize that my floating bridge was coming off the body as I tightened the strings"}
{"source": " So I pulled the back plate off my strat and set to off tighten down the the tensions screws"}
{"source": " I made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress"}
{"source": " The final time I tightened them down, the high E string broke"}
{"source": " Since these were my only beefy's, my day was done with these strings"}
{"source": " However, given how far I tightened the tension screws, I think I would have had to purchase an additional tension spring (not too expensive or difficult to install if you have the inclination to do it) to get the bridge flush with the body"}
{"source": "As I said, this isn't a knock of these strings"}
{"source": " I never really got a chance to play them"}
{"source": " Just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings"}
{"source": " It can be quite a shock the first time your see your bridge sticking out at a 45 degree angle to your guitar and if you aren't careful, you can damage your guitar"}
{"source": "Great EXTRA Light POLYWEB strings for guitar"}
{"source": "  Really impressed with the PolyWeb!  These are easy on my fingers and the polyweb don't sqeek"}
{"source": "My son plays electric and acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " He uses Elixir for both and swears by them"}
{"source": " He has had other brands, but they just don't stand up to elixir"}
{"source": "What you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone"}
{"source": " I'm not saying the tone is bad, but it's not as good as quality strings with no coat"}
{"source": " That having been said, I'm pleased with them as a string for guitar practice"}
{"source": " They last for months without a change in tone"}
{"source": " I don;t play much in public venues, so it is not a problem for me to change strings when I do"}
{"source": "These strings actually save you money because you don't have to change em much"}
{"source": " I keep em on a year or so and I play alot, out door indoor"}
{"source": " constant abuse"}
{"source": " they never rust"}
{"source": " When they break I change em"}
{"source": "now"}
{"source": "I'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change em"}
{"source": "they really hold up"}
{"source": " There are better sounding strings yes"}
{"source": " But if your plugin in anyway, you can tweak the tone"}
{"source": "The tone isn't bad, just not as good as a martin uncoated string"}
{"source": "but if you like longevity and less squeak"}
{"source": " these are great"}
{"source": "These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " They are just the right weight, and just the right amount of flex"}
{"source": " We've tried D'Addario, brighter sound (D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set, EXP 80/20 Lite), and Martin, a little stiff (Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12"}
{"source": "5-55 MSP4150)"}
{"source": " In the end, these Elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar"}
{"source": "As has been said, there is no perfect guitar string for everyone"}
{"source": " The perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar"}
{"source": " For the combination we have, these are outstanding strings"}
{"source": "On the strings lasting longer, that's hard to say"}
{"source": " Fresh strings do sound better"}
{"source": " It's clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings"}
{"source": " But I'm not certain these last so much longer"}
{"source": " We buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability"}
{"source": " Corrosion or crud on the string isn't the sole factor in changing strings"}
{"source": "June 15, 2010 Update: Elixir is a wonderful company"}
{"source": " On my third or fourth sets of Elixir strings, the G string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time"}
{"source": " Elixir is outstanding, they will replace any string that doesn't perform up to your standard"}
{"source": "The other amazing thing - I've watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings, and I'm still very confused"}
{"source": " The Elixir website (it's pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding"}
{"source": " Ther is a two part video from the Taylor factory on how to change strings"}
{"source": " I swear that if you follow those instructions, you will change strings in minutes"}
{"source": " It is so simple and so reproducible"}
{"source": " I love this technique"}
{"source": "I'm a huge fan of these strings now!"}
{"source": "I've been playing guitar for over twenty years now and I've tried just about every guitar string in existance and even these Elixir coated strings"}
{"source": "  I've come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it"}
{"source": "  Eventually, all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs, you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesn't make any sense"}
{"source": "  If you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what I do is I get the least expensive ones and make sure I wipe down and clean them, even using products like string cleaners and Fast Fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost"}
{"source": "Few people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": " and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names"}
{"source": "  Granted Elixir probably isn't one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price?  I myself use generic Kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and Memphis Electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest I could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way"}
{"source": "  In fact, you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings; at least most people would be able to hear the difference"}
{"source": "  Don't get me wrong these Elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique (practice), getting better cables, pickups, amps, guitars etc than from just using these strings"}
{"source": "  For better string life, just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use"}
{"source": "  This discipline once a habit is good enough"}
{"source": "Peace!"}
{"source": "There's NO SUCH THING as a \"best string\""}
{"source": "  From experimenting over the years, I've found that, while I have \"old standbys\" that will be the first thing I try, often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar"}
{"source": "Coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years"}
{"source": "  They're expensive, but they last a lot longer, especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly"}
{"source": "  Also, they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings"}
{"source": "Elixir Polywebs were the first coated string"}
{"source": "  The coating is much heavier than that of other strings"}
{"source": "  This produces a much less bright, more muted sound"}
{"source": "  I have an old koa guitar that is so bright I can't stand it with standard strings"}
{"source": "  The Elixir Polywebs tone it down to the point where it's perfect"}
{"source": "If you're looking for a darker sound, then Elixir Polywebs are definitely worth a shot"}
{"source": "  If you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings, then you definitely don't want Polywebs"}
{"source": "The 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound"}
{"source": "  If you don't want this sound, you could end up awarding them 1 star"}
{"source": "Fantastic strap"}
{"source": "  Nope, it isn't leather or tooled or all that kind of stuff"}
{"source": "  But it is really comfortable and fitted with ease even my CC-OT banjo that has a *really* tight spacing (all the others I tried were a bit of work to fit through the brackets)"}
{"source": "  Had it on my heavy weight resonator bluegrass, once again extremely comfortable and sturdy, so had to buy another so I can just have one on each"}
{"source": "Amazing strings, they last longer feel better on the bends than any other"}
{"source": " They have a smoother feel and a nice bright sound"}
{"source": "Taylor ships this guitar with these strings - and for a good reason!  They sound wonderful - right out of the box! Like with most/all 12-string guitars, lights or extra lights are most often appropriate - the feel of these Nanowbs is smoth and easy and the tome they generate, in tandum with the instrument, bring out it's best resonance and sustainability"}
{"source": "Give 'em a try!"}
{"source": "These are my favorite strings"}
{"source": "  They last a long time and my fingers don't hurt when I play"}
{"source": "  I tried Martin strings once and hated them"}
{"source": "I've used these strings longer than any other strings I've tried (about 7 years)"}
{"source": "  Last year I switched to D'Addario EXP16's because they sounded better on the guitar I have now, but still keep a pack of Nanowebs as a backup"}
{"source": "  Here are my pros and cons of this string:Pros:+Easier to fret and play than other strings"}
{"source": "  I don't know why; I looked up the tension stats on these strings and they seem to be equivalent or higher than other strings"}
{"source": "  But they certainly are easier to fret (press down) and play than any other string I've tried, including other coated ones"}
{"source": "  The coating on the Nanoweb strings is thinner than the Elixir Polyweb series, but still feel very smooth and even 'slippery', as some people remarked"}
{"source": "  They have very little string squeak"}
{"source": "+Last longer than any other strings I've tried - maybe because of their brightness, these strings mellow with age (as all strings do) but never really sound dull"}
{"source": "  The only reason I saw to change them was when they became overly dirty or broke, usually every few months of regular playing"}
{"source": "+Very bright sound, which cuts through well playing live with a full band, and livens up the sound of cheaper guitars"}
{"source": "  However, this can also be a con (see below)Cons:-Cost more than most strings, including other coated strings"}
{"source": "-Can sound overly bright, especially on some higher end guitars"}
{"source": "  They tend to dominate the sound of the guitar, which is good for cheaper guitars without quality woods or construction, but not so good for a guitar that already resonates well"}
{"source": "  For this reason I switched to the EXP16 phosphor bronze string for my current guitar"}
{"source": " The EXP16 is coated but has a more natural/dark sound that complements the 'woodiness' of the guitar better than the Elixirs (although not as easy to play)"}
{"source": "-Not available for export outside the U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": "  When I was working abroad, I used to buy these from a U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": " company who would ship them to me"}
{"source": "  Elixir changed their policy to prevent this, so I ended up switching strings because the cost of Elixirs abroad was so high"}
{"source": "Lately I have been experimenting with various make of acoustic guitar strings"}
{"source": "to the less and also most expensive strings"}
{"source": "  I find the Elixir excellent"}
{"source": " My testing is ongoing and cannot give the Elixir a top rating yet"}
{"source": " That may change along the way"}
{"source": "However, I believe that guitar strings are a bit like food and wine"}
{"source": "  What may appeal to my palate may not appeal to someone else's palate"}
{"source": "  Therefore, strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear"}
{"source": "My ears remain attentive to future string sounds"}
{"source": "  I also love the d'Addario make"}
{"source": "  Which I purchase through Amazon"}
{"source": "always"}
{"source": "I've been using Nanoweb and Polyweb (no idea what the difference is) Elixirs consistently for years now on my Martin Jumbo Cutaway"}
{"source": "I periodically try out other brands whenever I see something that might compete, especially when another \"extended life\" or \"coated\" string is released"}
{"source": " I would happily bail on Elixir at $13 a set if someone offered a cheaper option that worked as well"}
{"source": " In fact, I was quite optimistic about the $9 D'Addario EXPs until I heard their tone begin to evaporate after a few days like any other string"}
{"source": " Nothing that I've used up to this point has gotten close to challenging the quality of the mighty purple box"}
{"source": "The sound you get from these on Day 1 is crisp and beautiful as expected"}
{"source": " That's not where Elixirs kill the competition though"}
{"source": " It's after 20 hours of play that they show their strength"}
{"source": " You will still hear fresh, bright tones from them when any other set would have already crossed into the dead zone"}
{"source": " In fact, I typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull"}
{"source": " I play relatively aggressively and use palm-muting constantly, allowing skin oils to eat right through the strings at the bridge"}
{"source": "Saying that the tone lasts 3"}
{"source": "5x longer (as stated on the box) might be a stretch but there is no question that you get at least double the life out of these at less than twice the cost of alternatives"}
{"source": "If you are an occasional player or a music shop owner, these are a no-brainer"}
{"source": " The coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure"}
{"source": " For the everyday, aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life"}
{"source": "One nit-picky point of criticism: the packaging is an issue for me"}
{"source": " WHY would any manufacturer still utilize tree-killing paper envelopes that allow strings to get stale? I'm seriously asking! I've got to be missing something here"}
{"source": " A shred of plastic sealed around all 6 strings is greener, more cost-efficient, and it keeps the strings fresh (thank YOU D'Addario, I'll never leave your electric strings)"}
{"source": " I would happily buy Elixirs in bulk if I had faith in their shelf-life"}
{"source": " Complaints about these snapping prematurely are probably valid, happening when someone gets a set that's been sitting around for a while"}
{"source": " Think of them as a perishable and buy them from places that move a lot of units (like Amazon :)"}
{"source": "Regardless of the string itself, I insist on honesty in advertising and marketing"}
{"source": "  So when I was earnestly considering ordering this string I read the summary, in which it was stated:\"Elixir Strings are coated in a unique way to protect wound strings from your DNA and other contaminants"}
{"source": "\"Ohhhh"}
{"source": " protects my string from DNA!  Yeah, that DNA really messes up guitar strings all right"}
{"source": "  In fact it's the worst contaminant EVER"}
{"source": " worse even than the oils and acids on our skin"}
{"source": " worse than the cells themselves that contain and hold the DNA from exposure because the DNA is the blueprint of those cells, contained deep within protective walls"}
{"source": "  But somehow that nasty ol' DNA leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings!Honestly"}
{"source": "  It's like none of us have ever attended a biology class because we're musicians?As I read the reviews, I noted review after review after review that seemed like some sort of marketing promo"}
{"source": "  I noticed not one of those reviews indicated they had actually purchased the product from Amazon"}
{"source": "  Hmmmm"}
{"source": "The first honest review I found was one which said, \"These strings sound somewhat artificial"}
{"source": "\"  Ah finally, one of the REAL reviews"}
{"source": "Look, the product may be good or not"}
{"source": "  It may be the best string ever or not"}
{"source": "  But am I going to spend time and money testing a string that apparently can't stand on its own quality without bogus marketing hype?We're musicians, not morons"}
{"source": "  If you want us to buy a string, be totally honest in the marketing"}
{"source": "  A quality string will sell itself by performance, sound and long life"}
{"source": "  No matter how heavy the marketing hype, if the string is bad you'll only sell one set"}
{"source": "  If it's good"}
{"source": " you don't need the hype"}
{"source": "EDIT FOLLOW-UP:  After reading numerous reviews, this does actually seem to be a good set of strings"}
{"source": "  Which means the product can stand on customer testimony alone and shouldn't need spin to sell"}
{"source": "  Just sayin'"}
{"source": "  ;)"}
{"source": "Time will tell if they last longer than strings 1/3rd the price"}
{"source": " Visually, they don't appear any different than cheaper Bronze wound strings"}
{"source": " I was expecting something different, but as far as sound goes, the strings tuned well and only required some stretching 3 times to get them to stay in tune, even after playing &#34;smear notes&#34; on several songs"}
{"source": " My problem with cheaper strings (De'Angelo) was they would tarnish or rust quickly, the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar"}
{"source": " The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer"}
{"source": " I'll know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not"}
{"source": " Since these are literally triple the cost, I'll know if it was worth the extra expense"}
{"source": " Hopefully these are made in the USA instead of China like most other things we buy in America"}
{"source": " Good or bad, once I see the longevity of this set, I'll add to this review at that time"}
{"source": "The Nanoweb strings do stay clean and they stand up but, on the negative side"}
{"source": "I replaced one string in my set with a nanoweb and noticed right away the feel was slippery"}
{"source": " When picking my fingers would slip on the nano string rather than pluck"}
{"source": "  I will stick to cleaning my good old standard strings"}
{"source": "I hesitate to write this review simply because it's pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings"}
{"source": " To be honest, I was very, very impressed with their feel and handling"}
{"source": " I do think they're the best playing strings I've used when it comes to pure playability"}
{"source": " Hands down, none better"}
{"source": " They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking"}
{"source": " But for me it was a trade-off, because I simply wasn't impressed with the tone"}
{"source": " I even took the time to try them on three different guitars (all dreadnoughts): a classic maple sides/spruce top, a mahogany back/sides with spruce top, and a maple backs/sides with a nato top"}
{"source": " On all three, I didn't like the tone as much as the strings I was using"}
{"source": " I really wanted to like them, but they simply didn't have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use"}
{"source": "This isn't to say they're not great strings that sound different on other peoples' guitars, but I simply didn't like them on mine"}
{"source": " I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group"}
{"source": " The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use, and the treble sounds tinny vs"}
{"source": " the clear ring of the Martins I normally use"}
{"source": " To be fair, the bass strings sound great, and aren't much different"}
{"source": " I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you're going to use them"}
{"source": " I play in acoustic groups, and the Elixir strings just don't have what I need to be heard, in spite of how great they feel under your fingers"}
{"source": " If playability is more important than great tonal range, then by all means buy these strings"}
{"source": "you won't be disappointed"}
{"source": " I'm guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric, where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones"}
{"source": "I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar"}
{"source": " Installed as usual and tuned them"}
{"source": " They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible"}
{"source": " My capo could not even hold them"}
{"source": " I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking"}
{"source": " When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off"}
{"source": " I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it"}
{"source": " I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail"}
{"source": " The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now"}
{"source": " Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them"}
{"source": "I tried these not knowing what to expect, and have been very pleasantly surprised"}
{"source": " I tend to have sweaty hands, and my guitar strings get a lot of crud on them and then eventually rust"}
{"source": " Although I have learned now to wipe them down each time I play, they still deteriorate pretty quickly, and it's a pain"}
{"source": " When I wipe them down with a cloth, they leave black streaks of crud on the cloth"}
{"source": "The Elixirs are not as bright as other strings when you first put them on -- that is true"}
{"source": " However, other strings lose their brightness after just a few hours of playing, so I don't see this as a major disadvantage"}
{"source": " The advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them"}
{"source": " When I wipe them down, there's nothing on the cloth! I've even stopped wiping my strings down as carefully"}
{"source": "So for a player like me, these are a godsend"}
{"source": " I don't detect any loss of tone"}
{"source": " They are a bit slippery, and some people have reported having trouble because of this, but it's fine for me"}
{"source": "Definitely they're worth a try"}
{"source": " Although they're twice as expensive as regular strings, they'll last longer, so they're worth checking out! Ernie Ball makes titanium coated strings that I'm interested in trying out, and there are some other brands, too"}
{"source": "Love these strings"}
{"source": " I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly"}
{"source": " I have a washburn with a glossy, sealed looking fretboard, that doesn't have that problem, but still prefer these strings for it as well"}
{"source": " They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie ball's, but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding"}
{"source": " I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands"}
{"source": "not two weeks after I put these on the A string broke close to the ball on the string"}
{"source": "  I break high e strings on occasion"}
{"source": "  but something as thick as an A string?? maybe it was a defective string as I thankfully bought two sets and I was able to pull the A out of the other set and it has been fine since"}
{"source": "  now however I have the dilemma of should I just buy more strings and just use the second set as I need them"}
{"source": "  Further more do I stick with the same brand"}
{"source": "  that is supposed to last longer than average strings"}
{"source": "  At this point I am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there"}
{"source": "  I will update once I decide if I should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month went by(a week ago) and the D string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe I either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be"}
{"source": " either way its losing another star"}
{"source": "  if it happens with a different set of strings I will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly"}
{"source": "They will always sound the same as the very first day, I love this strings, currently on all my guitars"}
{"source": "I really like these strings, because I have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast"}
{"source": " I can play a guitar once, and leave it there for 2-3 weeks, and the strings will be rusty and nasty when I return to it"}
{"source": " I now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them, but this stil happens"}
{"source": "Then I happened across these Elixir nanowebs"}
{"source": " They are great"}
{"source": " I no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly, and they stay rust and gunk-free for 2+ weeks (of regular playing)"}
{"source": " However, I did encounter one strange thing"}
{"source": " While playing at a rehearsal, my E-string just popped and broke, hurting my finger a bit"}
{"source": " I was surprised, because outwardly the string didn't look that bad"}
{"source": "So that is the downside"}
{"source": " With regular strings, you can tell the string is near the end of its life b/c it looks really bad"}
{"source": " With these, they may still look okay but be close to breaking"}
{"source": " Made me a little cautious"}
{"source": "I still prefer these 100% over other strings, though"}
{"source": "These are the best strings ever"}
{"source": "  I've tried almost every string on the market, and these are by far my favorite"}
{"source": "  They sound great and last forever"}
{"source": "  Believe the hype"}
{"source": "they really DO last FAR longer than any other strings, and they sound great while doing it"}
{"source": "Many other strings will sound great for a short while, but as soon as they get \"gunked up\", they lose any brilliance and tone, and become dead sounding"}
{"source": "  Not these"}
{"source": "  They will sound great for the life of the string"}
{"source": "  In fact, the only way I know to change them eventually is not because they stop sounding good (which they don't), but because I'll start having intonation problems and I know the strings need to be changed"}
{"source": "  Normal wear and tear does that, but these strings last SO long"}
{"source": "I've tried the polyweb strings from Elixir as well, but I didn't like those at all"}
{"source": "  To me, they didn't FEEL right"}
{"source": "  Sticky or something (not like your fingers stick to the strings, but like you could tell they were coated)"}
{"source": "  With the Nanowebs, they sound AND feel like regular strings, but last forever"}
{"source": "  The only string I'll use"}
{"source": "I liked my Elixir strings on my acoustic, so I knew that the ones for electric would be worth the extra money (as compared to non-coated brands)"}
{"source": "  They seem to create less noise from unintentional slide friction--it's sort of like the difference between flatwound and regular strings--these feel like super-flatwound strings, meaning they feel smooth"}
{"source": "  I have some nice callusses built up, but I imagine that I'd like these strings even more if I was just starting out (or restarting) because I imagine they tear up your fingertips much less than non-coated strings"}
{"source": "Good strings for my electric guitar"}
{"source": "I liked the product a lotClean sound, easy to change and much more"}
{"source": "Bought these for my son's electric guitar"}
{"source": "  He loves this brand!  They sound great and seem to last longer than other brands"}
{"source": "  Price is great!"}
{"source": "Elixir strings are very nice"}
{"source": "  so slick and last forever compared to standard strings"}
{"source": "But i will admit D addario strings are just as good but have to be replaced more often"}
{"source": " So if you have the money and want to try these technology advanced strings i dont think you will be disappointed"}
{"source": " Some people say they are too slick"}
{"source": " and i can see that when you put new strings on you expect them to feel a certain way"}
{"source": "  But you will get over that once you see how long they last"}
{"source": "Been using these for years"}
{"source": " They feel great, last longer than any other string and most importantly, they sound GREAT"}
{"source": "They cost a little more than other strings but they're worth it"}
{"source": "Totally awesome strings"}
{"source": " I've heard other strings are great too, but I highly recommend everyone try these if you haven't"}
{"source": " Outstanding string life, superior sound, ease of sliding, I get these strings every time"}
{"source": " Elixirs for life! I'd pay double for these strings all day"}
{"source": "As a professional guitar player, I am always nervous playing a show with &#34;old&#34; strings"}
{"source": " However, I've been using Elixir for over 2 years now, and the strings really do last a long time"}
{"source": " I would usually replace my strings every month, but I've started leaving them on for up to 6 months"}
{"source": "These guitar strings are very nice and I love them"}
{"source": " I always buy this brand"}
{"source": " They work well and sound amazing"}
{"source": "After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!Instead, I got a decent set of "}
{"source": "10's that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup"}
{"source": " I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely"}
{"source": " Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky "}
{"source": "10's"}
{"source": " Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings"}
{"source": "As for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told"}
{"source": " Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune"}
{"source": " Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings"}
{"source": "So, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings"}
{"source": "What's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?Especially when it costs three times more?And what's up with the tuning thing?And why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there"}
{"source": "Anyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while"}
{"source": " And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally"}
{"source": " So much for Magic Elixir Tone"}
{"source": "Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better"}
{"source": "PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions"}
{"source": " I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions"}
{"source": "[Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup"}
{"source": " Once again I ask: what good are strings that \"sound good three times longer\" if they break three times faster?][Edit: 10/31/12"}
{"source": " Come on! After four more hours, the A string went"}
{"source": " I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, \"Which one will go today?\" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension"}
{"source": " An hour later, guess what? Yep"}
{"source": " So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play"}
{"source": " Seriously?Not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks, I'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks"}
{"source": " The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new, but dang, unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such, I'd stick with Slinkies or D'Addarios"}
{"source": " Unless I got a \"bad set\", which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price"}
{"source": " In any case, these Elixirs were just not worth the money"}
{"source": "][Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage, and they sent me another set"}
{"source": " That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet, thought the tuning issue remains"}
{"source": " I'll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud"}
{"source": " But honestly, at this price, there should be no duds at all"}
{"source": "]"}
{"source": "These are my favorite brand of strings"}
{"source": "When i was a beginner a few years back these were the 1st strings i bought on my electric (since i used them on my acoustic) And i have to say, elixir is my favorite brand of strings"}
{"source": " They last long, are easy to tune, & have a nice bright sound & if you take proper care of them (wipe them down when your done playing, keep the guitar in your gig bag when your not using it, ETC"}
{"source": ") that bright sound can last about 6 MONTHS OR MORE!! i usually just buy about two sets a year & im a HEAVY player i play about 2-7 hours EVERYDAY"}
{"source": " I love the coating aswell but the medium gauge & up usually don't have that other coating you can get on the light gauge strings, but overall these strings are awesome & are a must buy for every guitarist!"}
{"source": "great set of strings I will stick with elixir strings whether it be electric or acoustic great brand and they know what they are doing"}
{"source": "I put a set of Elixir Nanoweb custom light strings on my main acoustic guitar maybe a couple of months ago"}
{"source": "  Although I don't play gigs on it, I play the guitar just about every day, or maybe every other day"}
{"source": "  The custom lights are wonderful:  great durability, nice tone and projection, easy on the fingers"}
{"source": "  I bought a set of the Elixir extra lights for a Laguna 3/4 size travel guitar I have"}
{"source": "  The reasoning was that the lighter body guitar with a shorter scale could use lighter strings, thereby putting less stress on the body"}
{"source": "  Compared with the light D'Addario strings that came with the guitar, these have a more muffled low E string"}
{"source": "  The A string, too, doesn't project as much as the standard strings"}
{"source": "  Although I've not tried the extra lights on my full-sized acoustic, I suspect that there, too, the lower strings would not have the presence or ring of other brands"}
{"source": "  Even with the custom light set--where the lower strings are a heavier gauge than a normal light set--the bass notes have a slight hint of that muffled quality"}
{"source": "  The thing that most players of Elixirs seem to talk about is the playability and the durability"}
{"source": "  They are smoother feeling than non-coated strings, and certainly don't degrade because of perspiration nearly as quickly as regular strings"}
{"source": "  The other thing that's important to know, though, is that the Elixirs are excellent at holding a tune, once they're stretched and broken in"}
{"source": "  That being said, I'm not sure that I would put the extra lights on the Laguna again because of the bass projection issue:  a small guitar has little enough bass to begin with and these strings don't help"}
{"source": "  As you might have guessed, though, I'm thoroughly convinced about the custom lights on the full-sized acoustic"}
{"source": "It was time for a change after many years of using the same strings and I am really glad I tried Elixir"}
{"source": " They feel really nice and sound awesome, I will be sticking with these now, thanks for the good and prompt service as well Cheers !!!"}
{"source": "Love Elixir strings! I bought my first pack, over 7 years ago and I've been hooked"}
{"source": " They last, at least, twice as long as traditional copper wound strings, and sound even better"}
{"source": " GET THESE! These make my cheap $50 acoustic guitar, sound almost as good as my Martin"}
{"source": "no kidding"}
{"source": "I first discovered Elixir strings when I purchased my Taylor and I've been a convert ever since"}
{"source": "  They cost roughly two or three times as much as uncoated strings but are well worth it"}
{"source": "  If your hands perspire when you play, this product will keep your strings sounding new and fresh"}
{"source": "  They sound great on my Martin too !"}
{"source": "I have used these strings for years and this was a great price"}
{"source": " Shipping time was good"}
{"source": "What can I say, I am a string snob! Ive tried MANY different kinds of strings for my acoustics and the Elixir Nanowebs are by far the best strings I have ever played"}
{"source": "I had a set of another major brand on a cheap Washburn I bought, and I changed them out with these strings and WOW what a HUGE difference"}
{"source": " The guitar has such a great ring to it"}
{"source": "Also use these on my Taylors"}
{"source": " These will give any quitar a beautiful voice!Pros:LifeSoundPlayabilityQuality and DurabilityCons:Price"}
{"source": "I have tried many types of steel strings"}
{"source": "  My Taylor 355 came delivered with these - and though I have tried several others, I have returned to them"}
{"source": "  Their ease of play (smoothness to fret and finger) and light but rich tonality makes them a good choice for your 12-string"}
{"source": "  Haven't tried 'em yet?  Pick up a set - they ARE different and, in many ways, better than the more standard Phosphor Bronze strings that were the best before these came along"}
{"source": "I own aTaylor Guitars 355-CE Jumbo 12 String Acoustic Electric Guitarand it came with these strings on it"}
{"source": " 12 string guitars are generally hard to play for long periods of time, so they might not get as much use as a regular 6 string"}
{"source": " The tone from these strings is just as bright and clear 8 months later, and they still hold their tuning like they after the first 2 days"}
{"source": " Elixir strings are in general more expensive than other major brands - but the extra few bucks are worth it because the sounds stays so clear and consistent after extensive use"}
{"source": " They are great strings on any guitar"}
{"source": "WOW, is putting it mildly when you here the quality sound that these strings produce on a 12 string"}
{"source": "Endless beauty when you here the tones produced by Elixer"}
{"source": " Elixer strings are more expensive than other strings but well worth the higher price tag"}
{"source": " You can not go go with a set or two of Elixers"}
{"source": "These strings are great for a 12 string"}
{"source": " I started using coated strings on all of my guitars last year and have gotten use to the smooth feel"}
{"source": " A 12 string is a little harder on the fingers so the coating is nice to have"}
{"source": " They sound as bright and clean as any uncoated string I have used on this guitar"}
{"source": " And I think they will last longer"}
{"source": " Which is nice because the guitar is really not much fun to restring!"}
{"source": "I was a little reluctant to try the EVO XM as I have a Vendetta and the tuners are junk"}
{"source": "  Fortunately this guitar does not inherit this issue"}
{"source": "It's a beautiful looking guitar with very nice setup"}
{"source": "  Action is incredible"}
{"source": "  Almost too low for those that do a lot of stretching but great for those that are into fast riffs"}
{"source": "  The difference in tone between the neck and bridge pickups is great and the pickups are very responsive"}
{"source": "Hardware is slightly better than expected for this price point"}
{"source": "In the past I've always just guessed at how tight to make each lug on my drums"}
{"source": " This takes the guess work out of tuning your hides"}
{"source": " Each setting doesn't correspond to any particular octave but once you get the sound you want at least you know all of the lugs on that hide are pretty close to the same torque"}
{"source": " It's also easy to use"}
{"source": "B"}
{"source": "I love the idea of this but I wish I had spent more for a better quality version"}
{"source": " I had seen them used by others and chose this one but it is not well made"}
{"source": " The number dial is not accurate and is loose so as you are using it you have to keep checking that it has not moved"}
{"source": " It works but I'll probably end up getting a better one"}
{"source": "I purchased this key on a whim"}
{"source": "  When it arrived the instructions were not clear, but I sat the dial to #2, loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns, and tested the first cut of tuning"}
{"source": " Too loose and deep, so I increased the setting to #3 and repeated"}
{"source": "  Almost the sound I wanted, so I used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern"}
{"source": "  Perfect"}
{"source": "  I then started on the next largest tom, working back to the smallest"}
{"source": "  Using the #3 setting plus an eighth turn I got my toms 1/2 octave apart"}
{"source": "Next I worked on my snare drum, starting with the snare side, then the batter side"}
{"source": " I used #4 on the batter side and #5 on the snare side, and managed to get the crisp, yet warm, sound I wanted"}
{"source": " The bass drum came next - I set the batter side tension 1 notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning"}
{"source": " From there I went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning I attained"}
{"source": "This is an easy device to use - with the lever facing you move it to the left, loosen all of your lugs, then tighten each starting with one or two"}
{"source": " When the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting"}
{"source": "  Test, increase a notch if necessary, and repeat until you get the sound you want"}
{"source": " Set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other (and to your desired sound), and you will have a perfectly tuned set"}
{"source": "I'll never go back to tuning by ear!  You'll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key, and don't forget to write down your optimum settings"}
{"source": "This is my second 4 way switch and it won't be the last"}
{"source": " The four way gives you an added combination of neck and bridge in series, which gives a fatter tone than position 2 and more output than positions 1,2,or 3"}
{"source": " I am very pleased with the &#34;new sound&#34; of my tele"}
{"source": " The wiring diagram is very easy to understand and the install is pretty easy if you have a soldering gun"}
{"source": " (don't forget to lay down some newspaper to protect your guitar finish from solder)"}
{"source": "This switch does work, but you should look before you leap"}
{"source": " The switch travel is greater than it is for a standard 3-way switch, and if you use the common Fender replacement control plate (or one that was only intended for a 3-way switch, it may not fit"}
{"source": " You could fairly easily alter the plate, but if you want the cleanest look possible you may want to investigate a new control plate"}
{"source": "Recently, I was building a Telecaster project"}
{"source": "  A friend recommended using the 4 way switch instead of the stock 3 way switch"}
{"source": "  This allows you to have the three positions normally found on a Telecaster,  bridge only,  bridge + neck in parallel, and neck only"}
{"source": "  It also adds the ability for you to add a setting with the bridge and neck pickups in series"}
{"source": "The result of this added position is that you get a higher volume output from the guitar than in the regular bridge + neck position and  a slightly higher top end output"}
{"source": "  This is clearly a case of &#34;your mileage may vary"}
{"source": "&#34;  I've been used to the traditional 3-position switch on my other Telecasters"}
{"source": "  I'm a bit indifferent to this mod"}
{"source": "  If I was building another guitar, I would probably use this switch again"}
{"source": "  It does what it is supposed to do and it is within a couple dollars of the 3-way"}
{"source": "  However, I would not change out a working 3-way switch for this"}
{"source": "  For me, the added benefit just isn't worth the effort"}
{"source": "I got these for a parts-tele I built and I'm really happy with them"}
{"source": "  Like all vintage tuners you may need conversion bushings to make them fit modern peg holes which are usually larger"}
{"source": "  But they look great, work great, stay in tune and are completely vintage spec"}
{"source": "  I have a '57 reissue strat and I can't tell the difference"}
{"source": "  One thing I've always loved about vintage tuners is that you tuck the strings in the center of the shaft so it keeps the headstock looking neat"}
{"source": "These are nice,and this was easily the best price around"}
{"source": " These are made in Japan, and I believe they're made for Fender by Gotoh, so they're good quality"}
{"source": " But I was annoyed that they ( the bushings) didn't fit the \"standard,vintage-sized\" "}
{"source": "340\" holes in my All-parts neck ( they're a little large)"}
{"source": "So be aware of that"}
{"source": "Looks good but disappointed that they aren't made in the USA"}
{"source": " Oh well just shows me little by little more and more things aren't anymore"}
{"source": "First of all, don't expect any new tuner to work as a \"drop-in\" replacement"}
{"source": "  Drop-in replacements for tuners basically don't exist unless you have the exact type of tuner, and in that case, you aren't doing an \"upgrade\""}
{"source": "  You'll likely need to bore out additional diameter for the peg hole with a drill press or tapered reamer"}
{"source": "  Or, if there's a Guitar Center or guitar shop nearby, have a tech do the work for you"}
{"source": "These tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive, with a nice vintage look"}
{"source": "  They would look great on a either a Strat or Tele"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately, my Squier Bullet had a slightly smaller headstock, which meant that the low E string's tuner was too large - the wing for the screw hung over the edge"}
{"source": "  Therefore, I will not be installing these on my guitar, but that is not the fault of the tuner"}
{"source": "Functionally, these are one of the easiest tuning keys to rotate, and I've heard the hold tune just fine"}
{"source": "  Check the back of your headstock for fit, but if that's a \"go\", these are a great option!"}
{"source": "Had the old stamped one and was upgrading all the chrome some I put one of these on"}
{"source": "  They work perfect and look good"}
{"source": "  You get 2 in package (with screws) so I have a spare"}
{"source": "Update I only had one on E/B but went ahead and added one for G/D"}
{"source": "  Works and look great!!!  google \"stratocaster string tree placement\" if you are unsure of where and how to install"}
{"source": "A great, clean look for the otherwise ugly string guide clamps"}
{"source": " The guides on these are not rollers, but are the next best thing visually and performance wise in my opinon"}
{"source": "  The only guides that I like better are the round 50's guides for Tele's, but then I like those asthetically only on Tele's"}
{"source": "  An inexpensive mode that looks and works great"}
{"source": "  To the inexperienced eye this simple, clean looking mod can make a Mexican or Chinese instrument look more like the made in America models"}
{"source": "I put this in my Fender MIM Stratocaster"}
{"source": " I want to change that &#34;poor&#34; string guides that came in MIM by the American Series string guide"}
{"source": " So nice"}
{"source": "I may be a guitar newbie, but as far as I can tell - this capo is not a fake-o piece of crapo!"}
{"source": "I was impressed by the quality of this product"}
{"source": " It is simple and does its job well"}
{"source": " Easy to release and will work with a fat neck acoustic or Les Paul or with a thin neck on most metal Guitars"}
{"source": " Holds strings tight and is easy to place with no fret noise"}
{"source": " Was a great value"}
{"source": "In 40+ years of using many Jim Dunlop products Made in America or to his standards of quality, I've never broken or worn out the capo"}
{"source": " I use mine on both 6 and 12 string guitars"}
{"source": " The spring tension remains strong after several years, which keeps the sound nice without the strings being muted or buzzing"}
{"source": " The only problem I have with them, they seem to disappear when I'm not looking"}
{"source": " I have used other brands where the rubber leaves marks or sticks to the neck with prolonged use"}
{"source": " Other than smudges from getting the capo dirty, it cleans easily"}
{"source": "I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars"}
{"source": "  They definitely look great, but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so"}
{"source": "  That's my experience at least"}
{"source": "  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people, but they are wonderful"}
{"source": "  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out"}
{"source": "  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!"}
{"source": "I've had a few of these my life time because people always steal capos"}
{"source": "  What the hell"}
{"source": "  Anyway, this capo works well"}
{"source": "  I've only used it on Gibson and Fender electrics, and it does a fine job"}
{"source": "  Some of the rubber padding will eventually come off as glue wears off, but it does not affect the capo-abilities"}
{"source": "  I'm sure there are better ones, but for me, this works well"}
{"source": "Although it is touted for acoustic guitars, it works well with my Ibanez Electric as well as my dreadnaught and acoustic/electric"}
{"source": " The spring is tough and it holds securely"}
{"source": " On and off is a quick process if you have the hand/finger strength to operate it"}
{"source": " I rate it 4 stars only because I just received it and haven't had a chance to use it much"}
{"source": " But, I like it so far"}
{"source": " It was delivered quickly"}
{"source": " It does the job"}
{"source": " I'll update after I've had it for awhile"}
{"source": "I had always used the Kyser clip-on-the-top capos (and still do), but I liked the look on this Dunlop clip-on-the-bottom model"}
{"source": " It works great and looks better"}
{"source": "Like other reviewer wrote previously, I received less picks than advertised (I received a total of 7 picks)"}
{"source": " I don't know if the people at customs \"borrowed\" some from me, but I find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem"}
{"source": " Other than that, the picks are good, seem to be durable and produce a nice sound"}
{"source": "The Fender medium is my second choice for picks"}
{"source": "My first is the 'Just Strings' pick that is the exact same shapewith a softer (less scrape) feel on the strings at half the price"}
{"source": "Pick choice is like guitars and amps; everyone has a different opinion"}
{"source": "I am VERY satisfied with my hard shell A-style mandolin case; I received prompt delivery, it was reasonably priced, and a quality product; thanks!"}
{"source": "I gave this 3 stars simply because the review has to conatin a star rating"}
{"source": " I have nothing to say against the product or the company, only that this is NOT a GUITAR CASE! It is a MANDOLIN case! Amazon should correct this"}
{"source": "Stagg STB-10W  Acoustic Guitar BagEpiphone Case for Epiphone Dot, Sheraton, 335"}
{"source": "I just received the case today, the soonest delivery day on the estimation range (a plus there!)"}
{"source": "  Now having spent a long time pricing hard cases from all around internet, this price is extremely reasonable and a wonderful case"}
{"source": "  Nothing fancy and differs slightly from the pictured item in that the outside rim-threading and basic locks (keys included) are gold toned (instead of silver toned pictured), but that doesn't mean diddly-squat to me"}
{"source": "  Plush interior with a small, yet roomy, compartment located under the neck"}
{"source": "  I am primarily a 5-string banjo player, but decided to casually play around with the mandolin, and so I figured I had better get a hard case for possible \"long-time\" storage (my first banjo lived in a padded gig bag for a few years before I started getting serious with it"}
{"source": " and boy, not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces)"}
{"source": "  This case will definitely do the trick"}
{"source": "  Excellent value!- Additional note, there is a bit of extra play around the peg-head (I have an Rover mandolin)"}
{"source": " I can see if someone traveled with this case and dropped it hard it enough, some peg snapping may occur"}
{"source": "  But again, for simple storage/protection, its a non-issue"}
{"source": "These are a little larger than a traditionally sized, what you normally see used picks"}
{"source": "  Thus, just a heads-up"}
{"source": "  Having said that, they are top quality and are excellent picks"}
{"source": "  I use all types and all brands and Fender's are always predictably great quality"}
{"source": "This shape give the strumming hand a better grip on the pick"}
{"source": " I sand a bit from one of the points to give it a shape more like the classic heart-shaped Fender pick"}
{"source": " The stock rounded point dulls the attack on the string"}
{"source": " Good for strumming rhythm, not so hot for lead"}
{"source": "So glad I found these,  three sides,  much easier for me to hold,  thin is in!  As a beginner these make much more comfortable"}
{"source": "I wish I could say that they let me play more like Frank Zappa, but only practice can make that happen"}
{"source": "These are solid picks, they don't break apart, they're easy to hold, and they work exactly as a pick should work, and at a good price"}
{"source": "I bought these as spares (and they look really cool too!)"}
{"source": " I think everyone has used Fender Mediums at some point; these are no different"}
{"source": " Reliable, last a while and more important they're inexpensive!"}
{"source": "Everyone here seems to be complaining about the same thing- packageing and shipping"}
{"source": " Well i bought all my picks from the music store so im rating the picks only"}
{"source": " Ive been playing a few years and own a takamine acoustic and a fender strat"}
{"source": " I mostly play my acoustic and use light strings so i dont need a heavy pick"}
{"source": " I started using med fender tortose shell celluloid picks and really liked the look but as a beginner i dropped them more"}
{"source": " My friend left a thin pick and i tried it"}
{"source": " Since i mostly strum on light strings this was nice"}
{"source": " The pick had a little more give so i dropped them less"}
{"source": " Ive only broken 1 pick and it was cracked when i got it"}
{"source": " I started reading all these great reviews how the dunlop tortex was great so i ran down an bought some thins"}
{"source": " The tip is a little more rounded"}
{"source": " I tried them and they feel alright but the fenders were louder and brighter sounding no doubt about it"}
{"source": " So its back to the fenders"}
{"source": " Also something i learned is when i play a guitar that has a dark pickguard i use a light colored pick (pearloid) and a red pick for a white pickguard"}
{"source": " The contrast helps you see what your doing"}
{"source": " These are good picks and you have a good selection of colors instead of the dunlop that are color coded and your stuck with no choice"}
{"source": " These are a little more slippery but you will get used to them the more you play"}
{"source": " I dont drop em anymore"}

{"source": "My favorite pick for years was a Fender heavy and then I went for the really heavy brands like Dunlop or Clayton but found they are way too heavy and were eating my tone"}
{"source": " I went back to Fenders and then found I like the medium best"}
{"source": "Fender makes these in the coolest colors now so I went with them"}
{"source": " Price them at a store and you will come back here"}
{"source": "These came from GO-DPS which is no big deal as I shop on AMZ enough to know they use secondary sellers a lot of the time"}
{"source": "However, I ordered a lot of stuff the day I ordered these and the full exhaust system was in my house 5 days later"}
{"source": " These didn't show up so I contacted AMZ which goes back to GO-DPS"}
{"source": " it took nearly a month to receive an envelope containing 12 picks"}
{"source": " It didn't kill me not to have them - I have a million picks, I just wanted to see these in my hand"}
{"source": "That said, I will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors"}
{"source": "Great price, great picks"}
{"source": "I read the reviews for the bad shipping in the box & decided to take a risk since i really wanted to try fender picks & really wanted heavy picks & the shipping definitely improved it comes in a little plastic baggy & has the fender logo on it"}
{"source": " but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick, sweep pick, tremelo pick, tap with the pick better"}
{"source": " Also my pitch harmonics (better known as squealies) come out clearer to me"}
{"source": " Overall the product is not an disappointment & im only using these pick (just in different colors) from now on ^"}
{"source": "^"}
{"source": "I know many people love the design, but I find it much too frustrating"}
{"source": " You have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw"}
{"source": " Then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again"}
{"source": " What a farce"}
{"source": " This is the worst capo I've owned, and I've tried nearly every brand and type"}
{"source": " Yeah, I've had people show me how to do it right, and I know to do it right"}
{"source": " It's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me"}
{"source": " Also, while I'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing I want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw"}
{"source": " It's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with"}
{"source": " This design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it"}
{"source": " The only good thing I can say about it is looks durable"}
{"source": "No thanks"}
{"source": "Simple, compact, well constructed, easy to use, and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo"}
{"source": "This is the original Shubb capo, designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings"}
{"source": " The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make, each with their own specialized use"}
{"source": " The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models"}
{"source": " This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar, Heritage Cherry Sunburst), aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar, Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge, andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburstelectrics"}
{"source": " The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic"}
{"source": "Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension"}
{"source": " It's key to not get too much tension"}
{"source": "We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo"}
{"source": " Mostly it goes in a pocket"}
{"source": " Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck, it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock"}
{"source": " Not a huge deal, but a consideration"}
{"source": "Researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the Shubb"}
{"source": "  This is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types, it's a great capo and very durable in construction and material"}

{"source": "it's just that it gets in the way (for Me and my chording skills) mounted as designed and shown"}
{"source": " I altered the mounting manner to accomodate MY style and it functions fine"}
{"source": "(Looks great, too) High quality and compliments the Martin Name and reputation really well"}
{"source": " I feel that it's a good deal and  recommend it!"}
{"source": "I love this guitar strap button"}
{"source": " It's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in"}
{"source": " I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink"}

{"source": " Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close"}
{"source": "I got this for my Ibanez acoustic and found it was a real challenge to get it attached at the neck"}
{"source": "  It took a few trys before I could get it buttoned so the strap would stay put"}
{"source": "  Even so it was a good quality button"}
{"source": "  The leather is tough and will last for years"}
{"source": "  It will probably outlast the guitar"}
{"source": "If you're looking for a good way to attach a strap to the guitar neck is a possible option"}
{"source": "  Maybe if you have a Martin it might be a better fit"}
{"source": "  But it's really worth the hassle"}
{"source": "The biggest question I ask about these cables, are they worth the premium charged above more normal cables? The key to me is the lower end 100 series Monster cables,Monster S100-I-12 Standard 100 1/4-Inch Instrument Cable (12 Feet)"}
{"source": " The answer is mixed, and depends on what you are looking for"}
{"source": "The cable ends are very heavy, they are metal and do unscrew"}
{"source": " In some ways this is probably good, they feel good in your hand plugging and unplugging"}
{"source": " The jacks are gold plated and look like they would last a lifetime"}
{"source": " On the other hand, the series 100 plugs are a molded plastic end, with a good bit of flex to them, and they are lighter weight"}
{"source": " So the choice is, heavy, shiny gold; or light weight, gray/black? For me, I like the heft of these cables"}
{"source": "Construction-wise these are likely lifetime cables"}
{"source": " Check out the pictures I've posted"}
{"source": " The metal housing screws into the jack"}
{"source": " There is an O-ring to seal the top portion of the threads"}
{"source": " Inside the wires are soldered solidly to the jack, and then the whole thing is cast in solid acrylic or plastic"}
{"source": " Unless you run over this end with a truck or pulled really really hard like tug of war, the wire is never separating from the jack"}
{"source": " I don't think the actual 1/4 inch jack is any sturdier than other jacks"}
{"source": "Sound is excellent"}
{"source": " They are clear clean cables"}
{"source": " Are they better than the 100's? Oh maybe a tiny bit"}
{"source": " Maybe a little clearer, cleaner sound"}
{"source": " But it isn't a huge difference"}
{"source": "Bottom line, for gigging, probably go with the 100's"}
{"source": " The jack ends will get stepped on at some point and they are cheap enough to replace"}
{"source": " For practice or in your house, these are probably the way to go"}
{"source": " They do look particularly good plugged into a Marshall half stack"}
{"source": "These cables are not outrageously over priced like everything else Monster Cable"}
{"source": " Study different one quarter inch jack cables and you'll see these are priced very close to everyone else"}
{"source": " This is not the case of the HDMI cables at the big box store for fifty times what you should pay for them"}
{"source": "These cables work very well at transmitting sound"}
{"source": " So why only three stars? Well, these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find"}
{"source": " These are stiff, thick, and heavy"}
{"source": " While that's good for most analog cables, these cables are so stiff and heavy that, for instance, a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there"}
{"source": "With so many amps having plastic jacks these days, you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard-mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one"}
{"source": " I mean, let's face it"}
{"source": " You never know what will happen at a gig"}
{"source": " Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable"}
{"source": " A cable shouldn't come out because of a gentle pull, but if it's between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it, you want the cable to fall out"}
{"source": " If everything you have is heavy or Velcro'd to the ground, this isn't a problem, but it is for me"}
{"source": " I feel like when you're playing with these cables, you're worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it's seriously like a trip wire out there"}
{"source": "Lastly, these plugs are huge"}
{"source": " That's not really a problem if you play a Strat or a Tele, but what about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body? This is going to stick out a lot, and to loop it around your strap, it's going to be a huge, stiff, cumbersome loop"}
{"source": " I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments, but most normal straight plugs do just fine"}
{"source": " So yeah, if you like to move around on stage, get more flexible cables"}
{"source": " You'll thank me"}
{"source": "These cables are just poorly thought out"}
{"source": " They'd work great as patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amp (as long as you have a metal jack)"}
{"source": " Monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use, and at that price, Pro Co cables are also excellent, and they have brand name plugs, as well"}
{"source": "These aren't my first set, I can't count the amount of Monster 1/4 cables I bought and own"}
{"source": " None has ever failed me so far"}
{"source": " Highly recommend these!"}
{"source": "I compared this cable to the monster studio pro 1000 cable i also own"}
{"source": " I prefer this more as i play live and it does a good job in handling noise snd also has a no questions asked lifetime warranty"}
{"source": " Just take your broken cable to your local guitar center and they will replace it"}
{"source": " I got 4 replacememts over 3 years"}
{"source": " Worth the higher price because of the warranty"}
{"source": " The 100 dollar studio pro doesnt do well live compared to this rock cable as the studio pro sucks up tone snd only sounds good for recording"}
{"source": " note, this cable has high mid range so if thats what you like go for it"}
{"source": "This is definitely a high quality cable"}
{"source": " However, my experience with this model and the less expensiveMonster Standard 100 Instrument Cable 21 ft"}
{"source": " - straight 1/4 plugs S100-I-21model has shown me that the only difference is one is \"prettier\" with its gold colored, bling fittings"}
{"source": " Sonically I found them to be the same - or to my ears anyway"}
{"source": "As you can see by the tag above this review Amazon has verified that I purchased this cable (as well as Amazon verifying my purchase of the less pricey model on my review on that product page"}
{"source": ")I initially purchased a pair of these cables for my keyboards because I had invested a significant sum into those instruments and wanted nothing but the best cables"}
{"source": " I purchased the standard cables for some low end instruments including an old Squier Jazz Bass and a new, but very inexpensiveEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburst, neither of which to my mind warranted top of the line cables"}
{"source": "Much to my surprise, when I started testing each cable on each instrument (all through the same amp to keep things equal), I could not discern any sonic difference between both Monster cable models"}
{"source": " Same manufacturer, but different models"}
{"source": " To be sure, this more expensive model looked \"cooler\", but when it came to sound - no discernible difference (that I could detect anyway"}
{"source": ")  More perplexing is the molded stress relief ends on the less expensive model seem to make that one more reliable!My recommendation is test both this one and the standard model side-by-side before plunking down extra money for no added value beyond looks (which, I have to admit, may be a selling point on stage for some folks - no shame as long as you know what you are paying extra for and why"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "Very well made"}
{"source": "  No problems"}
{"source": "  Should be able to stand up to any use or abuse"}
{"source": "This mic is fine"}
{"source": " One should know that it has quite low gain and requires the use of a boost/preamp for the guitar sound to be heard"}
{"source": "Could not get to fit small sound hole"}
{"source": " Once in sound hole pickup did not work at all"}
{"source": " Would not buy it"}
{"source": "I've owned a Seymour Duncan Woody for several months now, and have had a chance to try it out with various amps, with the pickup tipped for a stronger low end or high end, and so on"}
{"source": "  This is an excellent value and is basically as feedback free as you're likely to get from an acoustic guitar pickup"}
{"source": "  The one thing I've found is that I get a significantly more natural acoustic guitar sound playing the Woody through my Ampeg bass amp than through my Peavey guitar amp"}
{"source": "  The high ends are too grating through an electric guitar amp and there's a tendency for distortion to creep in, even with the clean setting"}
{"source": "  Through the bass amp, though, the tone is absolutely clean and clear"}
{"source": "  The pickup is easy enough to install and remove and it's easy to get it to sit low enough that it doesn't interfere with finger picking any more than any other sound hole pickup would"}
{"source": "  The other great feature of this pickup is the look; the natural wood finish actually enhances the look of the guitar"}
{"source": "  If you are looking for an acoustic guitar pickup, this is the one to buy!"}
{"source": "I bought this for my 1974 Martin D-18 for recording on my PC"}
{"source": " So far it is working great"}
{"source": " I have a Behringer 802 mixer already and I just plugged the guitar into that"}
{"source": " It works perfectly"}
{"source": " This guitar is very loud without a pickup, but to get the sound into my PC for recording I either needed to use a mike or a pickup"}
{"source": " I chose the pickup"}
{"source": " I got too much background noise with the mike"}
{"source": "Update: I started to get a loud buzz in my sound system and scratched my head a bit trying to figure it out"}
{"source": " I had played my guitar about an hour before without that \"buzz\" being a problem"}
{"source": " I discovered that if I turn the guitar a certain way the buzz went away"}
{"source": " Then I remembered that the only thing I was doing differently was that I had turned on another overhead light since it was dark outside"}
{"source": " I turned that light off and the buzz went away"}
{"source": " My pickup was picking up interference from the new type florescent bulbs in the light"}
{"source": " I'm glad there is nothing really wrong with the pickup"}
{"source": " ;)After using the pickup for awhile I have noticed that the 5th and 6th strings aren't as loud as I would expect; also the 2nd string is louder than all of the strings"}
{"source": " I'm not sure why"}
{"source": " It's not a big deal"}
{"source": "Easy to use"}
{"source": " No metallic hiss you'd normally expect"}
{"source": " The only real drawback is the lack of presence when it comes to the bassier strings"}
{"source": " It takes some skill to EQ things to the point of normalcy"}
{"source": " If you're uncomfortable dealing with EQ, this might not be your best bet"}
{"source": " Otherwise, a wonderful product at a great price"}
{"source": "I've used D'Addario strings for many, many years without problems - both acoustic & electric"}
{"source": "  I've tried these coated strings in the past, and I actually prefer them to Elixir because they feel more like regular strings - the wrap is coated, rather than a sheathe being placed over the entire string, like on Elixirs"}
{"source": "Do they last longer?  Probably"}
{"source": "  Even when I'm in situations where I'm gigging regularly I rarely change strings more than every few months, just because I don't see the need"}
{"source": "  I think the main benefit to coated strings is if you have guitars that you can't play regularly the strings won't corrode"}
{"source": "  But these sound great and feel fine, and the're the least expensive coated strings I've found"}
{"source": "  I've always found D'Addario quality to be great"}
{"source": "Good strings, though in 1 use I didnt notice any significant improvement over the standard Diaddario phosphor bronze strings"}
{"source": "I've been using these strings for about eight years, and I also use them on my two Taylor's (814-CE & I use the mediums on my 710) I agree with the other reviewer in saying they are the best sounding coated string out there"}
{"source": " I still use Martin strings once in awhile, but these strings last and improve in sound as they get a few hours of play on them"}
{"source": "Actually I own three other acoustics other than my two Taylor's and right now they're all strung with EXP's"}
{"source": " I know people want different sounds from their strings, but I find these to be bright with a great bottom on them, unlike the Elixirs which I find to be unbearably bright with a weak bottom end"}
{"source": " These strings sound great with great dynamics on them"}
{"source": " Even on my Laguna Grand Symphony (slightly larger than a Grand Concert) they pump out the lows and sparkle on the highs"}
{"source": " These on my Grand Auditorium do the same thing, they produce the sound I demand and make a real positive improvement over the other coated strings I've used"}
{"source": "The Mediums on my 710 have an endless bottom end and still have great range on the mid's and treble"}
{"source": "As I said I still use Martin Phosphor Bronze strings once in awhile, but honestly these strings hold up extremely well and sound great"}
{"source": " Darn near as near to an uncoated string that you're going to find"}
{"source": "I tried the EXPs on my Gibson L4 archtop because I play jazz single lines, small chord comping, and full chords more than I do on a Martin OM-1 and figured I'd get a better overall feel for tone and response"}
{"source": "For years I've played Martin Phosphor Bronze mediums on both guitars and that's my reference: The D'Addario EXP lights show their difference mostly on the bass end where they're a good 7 mm thinner"}
{"source": " The high E and B are 3 mm less and I can feel it but not enough to bother me"}
{"source": " All things being equal I prefer heavier strings for tone but I play instruments I don't trust with truly heavy gauges"}
{"source": "The first thing I noticed is considerably less \"new string clang\" compared to both the Martins and D'Addario's regular phosphur bronze strings which I've used in the past and still use for mandolin"}
{"source": "While still a long way from sounding broken-in, the EXP strings sound as though they've had several days of good use"}
{"source": " As a kid I perspired much more and would just rot strings like you wouldn't believe - on a humid summer day I could get rid of that clang in a hour"}
{"source": "The tension on the EXP's feels very comfortable and considerably more flexible than the 7 mm difference should account for"}
{"source": " I like to bend strings on acoustic in certain contexts, which can be tough with tight strings; the EXP's feel very easy - not electric guitar easy mind you, but fine for acoustic"}
{"source": "The other quality that's noticeable is sustain"}
{"source": " The strings I took off weren't completely dead and I wasn't expecting a dramatic difference, but it's noticable across the board, especially on small chord comping on three or four strings at a time"}
{"source": "The tone also feels a bit more balanced across all six strings, but this is admittedly very subjective: I play with differently shaped and thicknessed picks for different recording contexts; some generate more percussive pick noise than others; sometimes I want it, other times no"}
{"source": " The response of the EXPs sounds very consistent to my ears"}
{"source": "I've had them on for a couple of weeks now, playing fairly regularly"}
{"source": " Some of the initial clang is gone but the (desired) bright lively tone has not degraded noticeably"}
{"source": "I suppose the real test of the EXP coating is how they sound beyond the point where other strings begin to sound dead"}
{"source": " Maybe I'll update this review down the line, but for me, it's a false question because if the strings don't sound and feel good in the short term, who cares if they last forever!"}
{"source": "After playing for years with Elixir Nanoweb 80/20's, I decided to experiment with a few different coated strings"}
{"source": " I tried the Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze, Dean Markley Alchemy Gold Phosphor (now discontinued) and these EXP16s"}
{"source": " Ultimately, I preferred the Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze the best, but the EXP16 are cheaper and the difference didn't warrant the extra cost, so I decided to stick with these for now"}
{"source": "  I wasn't a fan of the Alchemys because of their rough texture and high tension"}
{"source": " The EXP16s are smooth and have a very playable tension, although not as smooth and easy as the Elixir 80/20's"}
{"source": "  As far as longevity, these seem to last me about 2 months, which is on par with other coated strings I've tried, except for the Elixir 80/20's which average about 3 months"}
{"source": " Uncoated strings last me about a month"}
{"source": "Depending on the style of play, I prefer brighter or warmer strings, but I'd rank the EXP16s somewhere in the middle"}
{"source": " It's a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle"}
{"source": " Even though they don't project as well as the Elixir 80/20s, they have a very agreeable tone without some of the harsh overtones"}
{"source": " For live use with a pickup I'd be more inclined to use the Elixirs, but for unplugged or mic'ed use I like the tone of these"}
{"source": "Not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze? Not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze"}
{"source": " The EXPs are nice strings"}
{"source": " They have a nice feel to them along with less string noise"}
{"source": " And they last"}
{"source": " My two acoustic  guitars, a Takamine Mini jumbo and a Gretsch jumbo, both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars"}
{"source": " I figured i would try these 80/20 strings after using phospher bronze"}
{"source": " Only real problem i noticed is the 80/20s seem brighter and they ring longer"}
{"source": " I prefer the warmer tone"}
{"source": " And since my guitars have alot of \"boom\" already, i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast"}
{"source": " I imagine these strings may work in some instances, but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars"}
{"source": "I like Elixir"}
{"source": "  I had to try this one because of another friend said it's ok and cheaper"}
{"source": "I tried it and the quality is low end"}
{"source": "The sound is not as crisp"}
{"source": "The gauge is too heavy for my fingers (not their problem)All 6 strings are wrapped inside one single bag"}
{"source": "I'd go back to Elixir next time"}
{"source": "These strings are the bomb!  I have used D'Addario's since my earliest playing days"}
{"source": "  Over the years I have experimented with several different brands and eventually found myself at home with Elixir Polyweb lights"}
{"source": "  After having the frets on my guitar (a Fender grand concert) redressed I noticed it had been restrung with EXP's (which I used eight years ago and loved)"}
{"source": " Since they were on the guitar, I decided to give them another try"}
{"source": "  I am glad I did, the tone is great"}
{"source": "  They speak with a natural, bright and lively voice that is sweet to the ears"}
{"source": " EXP's make my guitar sound like it should"}
{"source": " Individual notes speak with warmth, definition and depth"}
{"source": "  They blend together beautifully when paying chords"}
{"source": "  They have more punch to them than Elixir's do and the coating doesn't fray after a year like Elixirs either"}
{"source": " D'Addario EXP'16s are probably the most musical strings I have ever used"}
{"source": "  They respond well to dynamics and the bass response is excellent when finger picking"}
{"source": "  I was able to get eight months out of them before I noticed deterioration in tone"}
{"source": "  I think I have found my strings and I don't see myself using anything else for a while"}
{"source": "I've been playing guitar for years and personally I would prefer Cleartone or Elixir strings"}
{"source": " I bought these for my little sister and she loves them"}
{"source": " They have a really nice sound to them"}
{"source": " I feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these"}
{"source": "These strings last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings"}
{"source": " I use the  EXP Phosphor bronze on my other dreads"}
{"source": "One doesn't get much better than D'Addario strings"}
{"source": "  In my opinion they're twice as clear as Martin strings and the EXPs just last forever"}
{"source": "  I like the standard Phosphor Bronze just as well and use those as a less-expensive alternative"}
{"source": "I certainly recommend D'Addario nylon strings on classical guitars"}
{"source": "  I've heard no other string that has the crisp, clean, rich sound of this brand of strings"}
{"source": "  I've used them for years and once in a while give in to the temptation to try another brand"}
{"source": " but always come back to this one"}
{"source": "Different diameter strings will sound significantly different, depending on the guitar you use"}
{"source": "  I prefer this mid-range string set for overall depth of sound and mellow beauty of tone"}
{"source": "  Any lighter and the guitar sounds \"tinny\", any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck"}
{"source": "  These are \"just right\""}
{"source": "I did not care for the tone or feel"}
{"source": " Took them off within an hour and put back on EJ16"}
{"source": " They had a rough feel and were stiff"}
{"source": " Lots of folks like them but not for me"}
{"source": "I bought this to bring my fender strat with me on airplane trips"}
{"source": "  I check the guitar in baggage with this case and it seems to protect it just fine"}
{"source": "  the it is very good for a Stratocaster and there is a little extra room inside for tuner, picks, tuning forks, capo, etc"}
{"source": "  and"}
{"source": "the price was very good"}
{"source": "  best I could find for this time of hard case"}
{"source": "  The only thing that is sort of weird is that most employees at the airport are constantly asking me if I have a gun in case"}
{"source": "  If you need basic protection of your guitar, this will do very well"}
{"source": "  I do not know if it will fit other guitars"}
{"source": "  I have heard that some are too long for it"}
{"source": "  but"}
{"source": "for the Fender stat, it works just great"}
{"source": "I ordered this for my Jackson DKMG"}
{"source": " This is my 1st Gator case, and I'm very pleased with it"}
{"source": " It is similar to SKB and fits my guitar very nicely"}
{"source": " Being lightweight is a big plus as well, and also the secure feeling of having a HSC"}
{"source": " I will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it"}
{"source": " Just remember that this model is for standard type axes; Strats, Teles and such"}
{"source": "I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars"}
{"source": " One was in the SKB Fender case ($99"}
{"source": "95 on Amazon), the other in this Gator case purchased locally"}
{"source": "  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case"}
{"source": " Both ended up in checked luggage"}
{"source": "  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up"}
{"source": "  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case"}
{"source": "  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, I just ordered another SKB Fender case"}
{"source": "  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips"}
{"source": "  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on"}
{"source": "Works perfectly for both my Martin dreadnought and my Fender Stratocaster"}
{"source": "  Solid unit, good material and construction, though it is made in China apparently--but hey thats why its such a bargain!"}
{"source": "Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars"}
{"source": "  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar, and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway, it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate"}
{"source": "  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low"}
{"source": "  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked"}
{"source": "  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands, but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these"}
{"source": "I don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school"}
{"source": " When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand"}
{"source": "It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar"}
{"source": " I just don't like the features of this stand at all"}
{"source": "Well built and solid stand"}
{"source": "  It keeps the guitar well protected and looks nice too"}
{"source": "  Some stands hold the guitar with only a hallowed little tube on the bottom, which breaks easily from the weight of the guitar"}
{"source": "  This stand holds the guitar with two solid metal bars, which should last a long time"}
{"source": "  It can hold both acoustic and electric guitars"}
{"source": "  Highly recommend it"}
{"source": "This is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size"}
{"source": "  Opens easily and folds up to a fairly small footprint for storage/transport, and it cradles the guitar nicely"}
{"source": "Two minor issues:1) Personal gripe - the git leans back a bit more than I would like"}
{"source": "  Makes it more difficult to hug a wall and ends up taking more 3D space than it really needs"}
{"source": "2) Product gripe - the two footer bars are not quite level with each other, so it rocks just a little bit"}
{"source": "  However, with a solid body electric on it, even a little rocking can be a really bad thing"}
{"source": "I like OnStage and own several of their products"}
{"source": "  They are well constructed and a good value so I have no doubt I was just unlucky with this one"}
{"source": "  I've been applying a little persuasion to even it out and it's getting better, but with the relatively robust construction it just doesn't want to give much"}
{"source": "  Kinda sucks that it's not level out of the box, so 4 stars"}
{"source": "Very sturdy stand suitable for stage use"}
{"source": " This stand even accommodates a double neck"}
{"source": " Its not very compact when folded but I'm still giving it 5 stars"}
{"source": "Have had one for years"}
{"source": "  Has survived many gigs and rehearsals, and many months in the trunk of my car"}
{"source": "  Harsh environment!"}
{"source": "After trying out a few other styles and brands, I settled on this stand, wanting something that would keep my 50s Telecaster from taking an unexpected fall"}
{"source": " The overall design of the stand is great, but I had to return my first stand, as there were severe quality issues with the finish"}
{"source": " There were at least 3 spots where the black finish didn't stick to the metal, and I essentially had bare metal spots sticking out"}
{"source": " The neck portion was also sitting cockeyed about 15 degrees to the right, once it was clamped down to the main stand body"}
{"source": " Disappointingly, the replacement unit I received also has this issue, but only about 7-10 degrees worth"}
{"source": " I'm going to use this stand in the meantime while I try to find something of a nicer finish, and truly worthy of my guitar"}
{"source": "Frankly, I'd never heard of a \"pop filter\" until my popping p's and b's came into consciousness at the same time that this device popped into my field of view on an Amazon web page"}
{"source": "  I'll bet that a couple of layers of women's nylon stockings would be just as effective, but this contraption pretty much purges your elocution of the offensive phonemes (they're called \"plosives\")"}
{"source": "  I'm still hearing the \"s\" phonemes (sibilants) along with some guttural artifacts (\"back\" vowels prefaced by an \"h\" that ignite a momentary gargling effect), but this filter doesn't purport to be able to do anything about those buggers"}
{"source": "As for the price, after seeing the gooseneck, the base, the generous-sized screws, etc"}
{"source": ", I'm prepared to say that  this one is fairly valued (I doubt that the Shure or Blue pop filters, at almost double the price, offer anything more than brand-name status)"}
{"source": "  The hardware and build-quality are about as solid and heavy-duty as you could wish for"}
{"source": "  (I know I'll never be able to blow it away"}
{"source": ")  Unfortunately, the clamp seems designed to fit on a mic stand rather than a computer screen, which is almost a half-inch too thick"}
{"source": "Its poorly made with attention to detail"}
{"source": " I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon"}
{"source": " But they will not screw down all the way and are losse"}
{"source": " It is useless!!! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine"}
{"source": "I use my Shure SM7B mainly for podcasting and voice work and it performs extremely well in those applications"}
{"source": "  I also use aHeil PR-40 Dynamic Studio Recording Microphoneand you can check out that link for my review on that item"}
{"source": " Both microphones are dynamic microphones and both give my voice a very warm, natural feel"}
{"source": "One thing, well actually two things, the Shure SM7B has that the Heil PR40 does not is a set of two switches"}
{"source": "  One for bass rolloff and one for mid-range emphasis / presence boost"}
{"source": "  While both of these switches can be useful, I prefer to keep the mic flat and let any outboard processing / EQ handle adjustments that need to be done"}
{"source": "  If you don't have outboard processing, both of these could be helpful to you as the bass rolloff really does help keep low frequency noises (for example, someone bumping the table) to a minimum and the presence boost does help certain voice ranges cut through the mix a bit better"}
{"source": "When I reviewed the Heil PR-40 I said that it was the best bang for the buck out there and the Shure SM7B may be changing my mind a bit"}
{"source": "  While the PR40 is about $70"}
{"source": "00 cheaper than the SM7B here on Amazon at the time of this review considerations must be made to the fact that most PR-40 users will want to use a shockmount (about $100) and pop filter / windscreen ($15 - $60) to get the best results out of the microphone"}
{"source": "  With the SM7B the shockmount is built into the microphone and does a surprisingly good job and Shure includes two different foam windscreens (one for normal use and one for ultra-close up use) with the microphone"}
{"source": "  So the bottom line is the Shure SM7B with all the accessories is probably going to be less than the Heil"}
{"source": "Another thing worth mentioning is that like the Heil PR-40 the Shure SM7B is built like a tank"}
{"source": "  It is a heavy microphone and in my opinion just looks very cool whether it is mounted on a boom or on a desk stand"}
{"source": "  Both microphones perform about the same as far as rejecting any off-axis sounds and both are excellent microphones for voice and podcasting applications"}
{"source": "The SM7B takes a little more to drive it than the Heil PR-40, so you'll want to make sure that you have a decent mixer / pre-amp that can handle the microphone"}
{"source": "The bottom line is the Shure SM7B is a very high quality microphone and I would highly recommend it"}
{"source": "  If you're comparing it to the Heil PR-40 most likely the thing that will make the difference to you will be the aesthetic differences and the price because the performance of these two is very, very close"}
{"source": "You are looking at what I consider to be the best friend a voice ever had"}
{"source": "  During a 40 year broadcast and voiceover career I have used (or been forced to use) every other large diaphragm studio mic on the planet along with the Shure SM7B and it's predecessors the SM7 and SM5"}
{"source": "Large diaphragm dynamics have some notable advantages over condenser microphones for voiceover work and solo vocalists in multi-track studio work"}
{"source": "  I've used over the years the Sennheiser MD421, EV RE20, EV RE27N/D, Shure SM7B, Shure SM7, Shure SM5 and most recently tried a Heil PR-40"}
{"source": "  Sometimes this was not of my own selection, but I just used what was available"}
{"source": "  Of the lot the Shure SM7B is my favorite of the ones still available"}
{"source": "  The SM7B is a better shielded SM7 and the SM7B of today has a better shock mount than the old SM7 or earlier SM7B"}
{"source": "  The shielding in the B model minimizes RFI from computer monitors, florescent lighting, radio transmitter proximity, etc"}
{"source": "  The SM7 was a redesign of the SM5"}
{"source": "  I consider the SM5 to have been the very best vocal dynamic microphone ever created but it hasn't been in production in ages"}
{"source": "  I have used a few ribbon microphones that were also pretty good such as the RCA 77DX and RCA 44 but they were not as good as the SM5 or SM7 or SM7B"}
{"source": "Today's SM7B is the best non-condenser vocal microphone still in production"}
{"source": "  Stop looking and buy one"}
{"source": "  You will not find a better microphone for voice work whether singing or spoken word"}
{"source": "  It has a very controllable proximity effect, something that is missing from the EV's"}
{"source": "  I can play a SM7B like a violin, the others I just don't seem to have nearly as much proximity effect to toy with for dramatic impact"}
{"source": "Everything that is good about condensers for voice work is in an SM7B while everything that is bad about condensers for voice work isn't"}
{"source": "DJ's change jobs a lot and I got tired of finding the EV RE20 & RE27N/D mics or the Sennheiser everywhere I went, so I bought my own SM7B"}
{"source": "  I never liked the EV's or Sennheiser much and didn't ever feel like they were much of a tool"}
{"source": "  The Heil PR-40 is pretty good but doesn't have any on-board EQ options"}
{"source": "  For recording not having the EQ is probably no big deal as you can tweak it in post production but for live radio you can't do much of that"}
{"source": "The SM7B is a tool for skilled vocal talent, so if you are trying to make a novice sound good you might do better with an RE27N/D but for someone who actually knows how to really work a microphone over then the SM7B is only dynamic large diaphragm mic I know of that can deliver everything a real voice artist has to give"}
{"source": "  The reason is that this microphone is designed for one thing, voice work"}
{"source": "  The others are more versatile, but the SM7B is \"THE VOICE\" microphone and that was all it was intended to be"}
{"source": " It has however found secondary duty as a bass cab microphone and it is pretty good at recording some very loud and boomy sound effects, but it is primarily a vocal microphone"}
{"source": "Of all the instruments that have ever been recorded or broadcast, the human voice is the most complex and difficult to capture reliably"}
{"source": "  That is one reason vocals sound good on a $4,000 tube condenser microphone, since it can capture all the complexity, inflection and multi-frequency overtones of the human voice"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately even these very best condensers also pick up lots of things you didn't intend and also have at least a trace of self generated noise"}
{"source": "  If you are doing a dry voiceover you can't hide the hiss of a condenser under something else"}
{"source": "  With the SM7B you don't have to"}
{"source": "Even for singing this microphone is sort of a secret weapon that kids calling themselves \"Recording Engineers\" today are usually totally ignorant about"}
{"source": "  They figure anything short of a multi-thousand dollar tube condenser microphone is inferior for studio vocals and this microphone proves them wrong"}
{"source": "If you want a good all around microphone, this is NOT it"}
{"source": "  If you want the best dynamic vocal microphone, here it is"}
{"source": "  As others have mentioned the output needs a decent preamp but works with all the pro studio gear I've ever connected to it"}
{"source": "  I think if you have some cheap USB interface then you will want to put another preamp in front of it and that will make it far more usable for recording whispers"}
{"source": "  Most real studio preamps are a good match for it"}
{"source": " I've plugged it into some real junky mixers and had it work too"}
{"source": "  You need at least 60 dB of gain, the spec sheet actually says 59"}
{"source": "  70 dB would be better"}
{"source": " Lots is made of the \"LOW OUTPUT\" of -59 dB but it isn't all that much less than the Shure SM58 which is -54"}
{"source": "5 dB! -4"}
{"source": "5 dB isn't much at all for any decent mic preamp"}
{"source": "  But again most of the \"one-box-solution\" USB interfaces with built-in mic preamps is probably going to need some help as they were designed with the hotter output of a condenser in mind"}
{"source": "The Shure SM7B comes with the built in shock mount in the stand mounting and yoke attachments"}
{"source": "  Every other large diaphragm dynamic has a shock mount made for it but it costs extra"}
{"source": "  They all need an external windscreen but only the SM7B comes with one! I got mine 10 years ago when it still came with two windscreens"}
{"source": "  It has a nice metal case for storage/travel"}
{"source": "  I think now they just come with one windscreen which is the bigger one Shure calls the A7WS but still come in the metal case"}
{"source": "  I use the smaller windscreen mostly and Shure calls them the RK345 and their distributors still carry them"}
{"source": " The smaller windscreen makes the microphone more open and airy for me and I'd suggest getting one of the RK345's, but that is the only accessory you'll need to add"}
{"source": "  The windscreens are held on by some little Velcro tabs but easily interchanged"}
{"source": "  They are also very durable for foam screens"}
{"source": "On the back end of the tube is a round plate you remove with a hex key and under the plate are multiple EQ adjustments for Flat/Bass Rolloff/Presence Boost settings that you can fiddle with to get the sound you like best"}
{"source": " You can just leave the plate off if you want"}
{"source": " This is easily the most EQ flexibility of any large diaphragm dynamic"}
{"source": "So I'm just adding my two cents worth here and joining the others who pretty much all agree this thing rules for voice work"}
{"source": "  I should have written this review earlier but wanted to try the new Heil PR-40 first to make sure I was still an SM7B guy and it took a while for the Heil tryout to happen since I didn't want to actually buy one"}
{"source": "  I still am an SM7B guy"}
{"source": "  I would give it 4"}
{"source": "5 stars but it won't let me do that, since there is nothing better right now in the class I rounded it up to 5 stars, but the SM5 was actually a bit closer to a 5 star vocal mic"}
{"source": "So I am a big fan of the SM57 Microphone as a vocal mic due to its ease of recording and good sound quality"}
{"source": "I have a bunch of the Large Style Condenser Microphones (Rode NT1-A, AT2020, SP C-1) and they are clear, but so sensitive that it's difficult to get a solid performance and mix without them either clipping or picking up everything in the room"}
{"source": " So if you're like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing, you should try a Dynamic Mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little"}
{"source": "I did an A / B test against the SM7B I just bought and the SM57 (I love) for vocals - with the exact same processing chain, cable, settings, etc"}
{"source": " and just switched the mics out"}
{"source": " I sung the same passage as well, and I have to say - the SM57 sounds muddy in comparison to the SM7B"}
{"source": " If I didn't have this new microphone I would still like the SM57, but the Genni is out of the bottle now"}
{"source": " so not going back"}
{"source": " The SM7B is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well"}
{"source": "DYNAMIC SINGERS ( Rock, Jazz, GOSPEL, OPERA )= If you have the budget get this SM7B and if you don't, buy the SM57 until you do have the budget"}
{"source": "QUIET SINGERS (ACOUSTIC , FOLK ) = If you sing softly all of the time you really don't need one of these dynamic mics, and would be better off with the standard Large Condenser mics as listed above"}
{"source": " Of those type, I like the Studio Projects C-1 Best I think, but they are close"}
{"source": "I can't do more than underscore the endorsement of this mic by the previous reviewer (FOX)"}
{"source": "  If you haven't started in the mic-collecting business, trying every trendy dynamic and condenser mic in the hundred dollar range and below, you might actually save some bucks by cutting directly to the chase and going for this one"}
{"source": "  I've always wondered why I can't reproduce the sounds of our local NPR outlet, and I finally realize it's because they have the Shure SM7B and I don't"}
{"source": "It enhances the voice with depth and richness and filters out the pops and unwanted percussives (face it, those separate pop filters are cumbersome to use)"}
{"source": "  It's very directional and \"selective\" (rejecting room ambience and background noise), so it's perhaps not the ideal mic for all applications"}
{"source": "  But for announcing, broadcasting, vocal performance and vocal recording, I don't see how anything could possibly equal let alone surpass it"}
{"source": "What you need to know about this mic:1) This mic is very directional"}
{"source": " You must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results"}
{"source": " Pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory, and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect"}
{"source": " I found that a palm's width from the tip of the mic works best"}
{"source": " As long as I keep my mouth there, the results are predictable and good regardless of the room I'm in"}
{"source": " Also if the mic is aimed too low on your face (like at the lower lip or chin) you'll sound like you have a stuffy nose"}
{"source": " Aimed too high (like at the bridge of the nose) sounds sneering and nasal"}
{"source": " Right at the upper lip works well for me"}
{"source": "2) The bass cut and presence boost are convenient"}
{"source": " Use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them, as metal will scratch it"}
{"source": " I've played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best"}
{"source": " Initially I thought the presence boost was a good idea, but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids"}
{"source": " Flat's where it's at"}
{"source": " Flat sounds most natural"}
{"source": "3) Being a dynamic, it won't sound as open and airy as a condenser might"}
{"source": " Though it takes EQ well, and you can EQ that in"}
{"source": " If you remove the foam and use a pop filter, you do get more highs, but after working with that for a while I realized it doesn't always sound right, seems to unbalance the highs above 5k toward sibilance a little too much, but it might work for you"}
{"source": " After using it for a few years, I learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the SM7B on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled, but really it's the mix that's the problem"}
{"source": " Whereas if I start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural, and build the mix around it, the mix turns out to have a natural sound that's not too bright or dull either"}
{"source": "4) Yes, it rejects room sounds more than a condenser, but not gobsmacked amazingly so"}
{"source": " It rejects what's behind and to the side, but in front it's pretty sensitive"}
{"source": " So if you're singing with an echoey room behind you, it will pick that up"}
{"source": " So don't think this will make you sound like you're in a dead control room, unless you actually are in one"}
{"source": " Hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you're set"}
{"source": " Being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser, it takes reverb pretty well in a mix, meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix"}
{"source": "5) So what does it sound like? The sound is *very* natural and true to my voice"}
{"source": " It truly is a vocal mic first and foremost"}
{"source": " That plus the dry/up-close characteristic are this mic's top selling points"}
{"source": " It works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse/acoustic/clean backgrounds"}
{"source": " It does have slight color in the mids; I agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop 400-900Hz, slight boost 1000-2000Hz, but it's still natural sounding despite that"}
{"source": " The color is tailored to the voice: reduce the honky boxy mids, accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range"}
{"source": " That's one reason why this mic is considered \"flattering\" on vocals"}
{"source": " It still has body though, definitely not a thin sounding mic"}
{"source": "6) This thing is heavy and rugged"}
{"source": " The capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone-like metal screen enclosed on all sides"}
{"source": " The screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors"}
{"source": " What I like about this mic is that I can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it, and it doesn't need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do"}
{"source": " So it's actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts"}
{"source": " Even without the adapter, it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount/stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down"}
{"source": "7) This mic needs 50 dB gain for loud singing, 55-60dB for quiet singing, 65-70dB for whispering"}
{"source": " Make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60dB of clean gain"}
{"source": " Some cheaper USB interfaces only go up to 35dB"}
{"source": " If your interface lacks the juice, no worries, get yourself a CloudLifter and it'll add 25dB of nice clean gain and it's phantom powered too"}
{"source": "Overall, I would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound, and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one"}
{"source": " But since my room isn't perfect, this will do"}
{"source": " The biggest pros are that it's natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix"}
{"source": " It's especially good on spoken voice, as it was designed for, since unlike a condenser the SM7B does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks, mouth noises, and background hissing"}
{"source": "In the end, if I had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life, it would be the SM7B"}
{"source": " Mainly because I know I can conveniently use it anywhere, anytime, and get reliable good results"}
{"source": "EDIT 2014:  Forgot to say, when you listen to mic shoot-outs on the net, often times the tip of the SM7B will be positioned the same distance as the condenser"}
{"source": " This is a problem because the SM7B's diaphragm is actually back a few inches"}
{"source": " So the condensers will be closer to the talent (or lack of talent) than the SM7B in such cases, causing the latter to sound more duck-ish, honky, un-detailed, or thin due solely to distance factors, and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color"}
{"source": " In shoot-outs where the proper distance was used, you'd be surprised how much the SM7B sounds like a good condenser"}
{"source": " It really does"}
{"source": " Of course it may be missing air (or conversely, be less prone to sibilance) but as I said below you can *easily* EQ that in, since this mic takes EQ very well"}
{"source": " Seriously, a 2dB shelf in the highs"}
{"source": " Another thing I wanted to add, is that the gentle bump in the 1k to 2k region (for vocal definition) that his mic has, can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources, but again you can EQ that down a bit"}
{"source": " And finally, when Shure says this mic has a flat response, that's not true, it has color and the frequency response charts show it"}
{"source": " Yet, the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice, so it sounds natural even though it's not completely transparent and honest"}
{"source": "I bought this compression pedal to give my leads a little extra oomph and it does just that"}
{"source": " When playing hammer-ons and pull-offs, sometimes it can be difficult to get them to sound as loud as the rest of your picking, but not when using this pedal"}
{"source": " It amplifies your quieter sounds and levels off the louder ones to give a smoothe sound"}
{"source": " Works great if used correctly"}
{"source": " Not to be used with dynamic picking sounds because you will lose that louder/softer sound"}
{"source": "I use this with a Gibson Les Paul, and Washburn Hollowbody through a Fender Super Champ amp along with other pedals"}
{"source": "  It can cause some major feedback if using heavy distortion"}
{"source": "Its OK, the adjust ability is not what i would like but it does have some uses and its built like a tank"}
{"source": " i got this for free from my girlfriend who had it given to her from some old guy who told her it was a broken distortion pedal so i can't complain about it not being worth what i paid for it"}
{"source": " i currently have this on my pedal board along with a Digitech MainSqueeze which is less expensive, more adjustable and just more versatile"}

{"source": " But at this fairly low price point you can't complain about much, and it's better than the real cheap thrones"}
{"source": "First of all, I use this as more of a 6 band EQ using the lower and highest more for LP and HP filters"}
{"source": "  The middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone"}
{"source": "  You can also use this as boost box, using the gain and volume sliders"}

{"source": "  I'd been looking for a boom attachment for a non-boom stand because I play guitar and sing"}
{"source": "  This seemed perfect, and it is"}
{"source": "  Regular booms have always been a necessary evil, in my book"}
{"source": "  They can be helpful, but also take up too much \"air space\" on cramped stages or in small rehearsal spaces"}
{"source": "  This thing gives you plenty of room to get the stand out of the way without making an annoyance of itself"}
{"source": "  The other thing I like is that the elbow where it adjusts has teeth that interlock, so you're not just tightening a joint and relying on friction - as those are the kind of things that eventually fail once the tightening bolt gets tired"}
{"source": "Anyway - no reservations about this one"}
{"source": "  A dead-simple idea that works great"}
{"source": "One thing I love about this extension bar is it will fit over the relatively large diameter down tubes on my hi-hat stands"}
{"source": " I use anOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneckto connect to the bar, then I attach either aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphoneor DM80 microphone"}
{"source": " The bar-gooseneck arrangement is sturdy enough for that mic model"}
{"source": "This also works well for mounting on microphone stands"}
{"source": " I use it and a shorter gooseneck to mount the DM70 for tenor and alto saxophones, or a DM80 for baritones"}
{"source": " Again, it works perfectly for my situations"}
{"source": "I always keep a few of these, plus various size goosenecks, just in case I need to mount an additional microphone and I am short on stands"}
{"source": " It's one more tool to make set up less stressful"}
{"source": "Trust me, when you need one (and chances are you will if you're a drummer or a sound tech) you will thank yourself for having the foresight to purchase it for situations I cited above and those that I have not foreseen"}
{"source": "I use this to position my iPad a way so that it's out of the sight-line of the audience, but it's also great for mic-ing drums"}
{"source": " Sturdy, flexible and well designed"}
{"source": " Lots of metal where there needs to be metal"}
{"source": " Buy a few, you'll be glad you did"}
{"source": "Think it sounds like a trash can lid? No, it doesn't"}
{"source": " It sounds like a crappy china which has it's place (in the rehersal studio for one"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": " Want a really good china? Spend more money"}
{"source": " That's how it works"}
{"source": " Great for practicing"}
{"source": " Small diameter gives it a shrill overtone"}
{"source": " Poor on recordings (unless you're looking for that"}
{"source": " there's always an application)"}
{"source": " For $20 though, c'mon"}
{"source": " What do you want? Anyone giving it less than 3 stars is a pretentious wad"}
{"source": " It's $20"}
{"source": " It was made in the remote hills of Wuhan China where they've been making cymbals of sorts for more than 3,500 years and you got one for $20"}

{"source": " And at the asking price, who can resist?"}
{"source": "wow haha!! this china"}
{"source": "really packs a punch haha!! I got this china and was blown away by it"}
{"source": " my band loves it, the crowds love it, and most importantly it is very loud and trashy"}
{"source": " great for hardcore drummers"}
{"source": "We live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals"}
{"source": "  One could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals"}
{"source": "  It's not unusual to see an online review and think a pedal sounds good then find out that it costs $150, $200, $250, $350"}
{"source": "whatever"}
{"source": "  There are a LOT of really expensive distortion/OD pedals out there"}
{"source": "I've had my Bad Monkey for about 7 years, after hearing good things I took a chance and gigged with it for many years"}
{"source": "  I rarely use a lot of gain on most pedals, just because those fuzzier tones can easily get lost in the mix"}
{"source": "  I generally use the Bad Monkey for mid-gain crunch tones, and for that it's just fantastic"}
{"source": "Having two tone controls makes all the difference"}
{"source": "  This pedal is Tubescreamer-esque, but not as midrange-heavy as a TS"}
{"source": "  Anyway, this thing sounds great"}
{"source": "  Excellent classic rock and lead tones"}
{"source": "The things it WON'T do: 1) a clean boost"}
{"source": "  It has plenty of output, but there's always a little bit of dirt in the signal, so it can't be used as a pure clean boost"}
{"source": "  2)  it won't clean up when you turn your guitar down"}
{"source": "or at least not much"}
{"source": "  No dialing in a crunch tone then turning down your guitar volume for a clean rhythm tone"}
{"source": "  I have a Barber LTD which does that beautifully"}
{"source": "But, despite those limitations, the Bad Monkey is awesome"}
{"source": "  At the very least it can be a great \"throw in your case to take to a jam\" pedal, but it's worth having on your pedalboard, as well"}
{"source": "I've had this pedal for about five years"}
{"source": "  I own a bunch of other overdrive pedals, including the Boss SD-1, TS-9, a Klon clone, and a bunch of DIY pedals"}
{"source": "  The Bad Monkey is cool for a couple of reasons"}
{"source": "  First is the bass and treble controls"}
{"source": "  Most overdrive pedals only have one tone control, the Bad Monkey lets you sculpt both the highs and lows"}
{"source": "  Second is the mixer out"}
{"source": "  Not everyone will appreciate this feature but it allows you to jack the pedal into a mixer or audio interface with a \"speaker sim\""}
{"source": "The gain sound is ok, but what I do is use it as a boost by diming the output and turning the gain all the way down which slams my tube amp giving me a natural tube overdrive"}
{"source": "  This pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid state"}
{"source": "It's built like a tank"}
{"source": "  Can't go wrong for the price, IMO"}
{"source": "This is purely an overdrive pedal, not a distortion pedal"}
{"source": "  It increases the gain and dirties your tone, but it does not actually distort your sound"}
{"source": "If you're a metal or hard rock player, don't buy this"}
{"source": "  It's better suited for country, soul, R&B;, blues, or even jazz players who want to boost their volume and umph when they're doing a solo"}
{"source": "  For that it's excellent, especially considering its very low price"}
{"source": "And despite its very low price, it's very solidly built"}
{"source": "  It's like a brick"}
{"source": "This update is to point out that I've only used the Bad Monkey pedal with tube amps: A Fender Blues DeVille 4x10 and a Line 6 Spider Valve HD100 MK II running into an Ampeg 4x12"}
{"source": "  I have no idea how it'll sound with a solid state amp"}
{"source": "  But it sounds great with a tube amp"}
{"source": "This update is to point out that I finally tried it with a solid state amp and it sounds pretty darn good"}
{"source": "  I recently bought a 100 watt Fender Mustang III combo to use as a practice amp"}
{"source": "  It perfectly compliments my Fender Blues DeVille 410/Fender Mustang floorboard combination"}
{"source": "  As I've said, I use the Bad Monkey as a boost for soloing"}
{"source": "  Whether I'm playing clean or dirty, the Bad Monkey gives my guitar a rich/deep/great sounding boost"}
{"source": "This update is to reiterate how awesome this pedal is"}
{"source": "  I rarely play directly through any of my amps, e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": ", Fender Hot Rod Deluxe, Blues Deville, Super Champ x2 or Ampeg B25, I'll turn down the gain on the Bad Monkey and use it for a much fatter \"clean\" sound"}
{"source": "  It's just so thick, like texas chili with lots of umph"}
{"source": "  You've got to get this pedal"}
{"source": "This pedal makes my Les Paul sing"}
{"source": "  Better than I imagined, even with all the good reviews"}
{"source": "  Such a wide range of sounds; warm jazzy boost, great blues overdrive, and almost some Black Sabbath distortion"}
{"source": "  Makes my crappy Behringer amp sound"}
{"source": " almost good"}
{"source": "If you listen or read what many pro guitarists and techies have to say about DigiTech effects pedals, they'll tell you to stay away from them"}
{"source": "except for this one"}
{"source": "  That's because the DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive is an incredible value that could go head to head with any pedal made by BOSS or the $100 TS-9 Tubescreamer"}
{"source": "In fact the TS-9 Tubescreamer is the pedal the Bad Monkey is best compared to"}
{"source": "  This is not meant to be a heavy distortion pedal with endless game - it simulates and overloaded tube amp that adds crunch and a little gain to an otherwise clean tone"}
{"source": "  Notes will sing and chords will really crunch, especially in blues and classic rock"}
{"source": "  But since the pedal works well as a level/gain boost, I've heard of guitarists turning on the Bad Monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects, to really push them to new levels"}
{"source": "But the best feature of the Bad Monkey by far is the two-band EQ"}
{"source": "  Virtually any distortion pedal has a \"Tone\" control that will make the tone darker or brighter"}
{"source": "  But since one band EQ basically takes away bass to add treble (or vice versa), you may not find the sound you want"}
{"source": "  That's what's so great about the Bad Monkey - if you feel like your tone is too weak, you can fatten it up"}
{"source": "  If it's too muddy, you can add treble"}
{"source": "  And you can make those changes without compromising the parts of the tone that you like"}
{"source": "Construction is extremely durable - die cast metal, and probably heavier than a BOSS pedal"}
{"source": "  The switch is more similar to a BOSS than an Ibanez pedal, but I find that easier to use"}
{"source": "If you're a beginning player or a player on a budget, this would be an outstanding pedal to own, along with a more traditional high gain distortion pedal"}
{"source": "  There's really no need to spend the extra money on a Tubescreamer, if that will prevent you from buying something else you need for your gear"}
{"source": "  But even for player where money is not an object, don't overlook the Bad Monkey"}
{"source": "  It might just be the only tube overdrive pedal you'll need"}
{"source": "This pedal is beyond loud"}
{"source": " It's to the point where if you crank this pedal with a 15 watt amp with an 8&#34; speaker, you will get noise complaints from the end of your neighborhood"}
{"source": " To match it up with the clean tone that I get out of my amp, I have to set the level in between 1 and 2"}
{"source": "The BAD MONKEY overdrive pedal does not produce \"Crazy Train\" metal distortion"}
{"source": " It isn't made to, and thus if you buy it for that sound you're off target"}
{"source": " (If that's the sound you want, I recommend: DigiTech TL-2 HardWire Metal Distortion Extreme-Performance Pedal"}
{"source": ") What the BAD MONKEY produces is delicious, bluesy overdrive at a highly competitive price (it currently sells for $49"}
{"source": "95 here at Amazon)"}
{"source": " Unlike so many overdrive/distortion pedals, the BAD MONKEY has independent (and sensitive) dials for treble (\"high\") and bass (\"low\"), and using them can greatly affect the resulting sound; they are by no means token dials"}
{"source": " In particular, the bass dial can be used to increase bass to an amazing degree (especially when using double-coil pickups); it's easy to achieve a \"fat\" sound with this pedal"}
{"source": " The pedal does not come with, but does accept, an external power supply (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", an adapter)"}
{"source": " It can also be powered with a 9V battery, which is installed under what's literally the pedal portion (just as in BOSS pedals)"}
{"source": " The BAD MONKEY is made of metal and can be used as a weapon if so needed"}
{"source": " It seems extremely rugged, again like BOSS pedals"}
{"source": " I have several overdrive/distortion pedals, but I find myself turning to this one again and again"}
{"source": " My impression of the BAD MONKEY is based on using it with [i] an Ibanez guitar with good double-coil pickups, [ii] an Ibanez guitar with good single-coil pickups (similar to \"soapbar\" style, or P-90, pickups), and [iii] a Fender Mustang II amp"}
{"source": " It works well with both single- and double-coil pickups"}
{"source": " If I lost my pedal, I would order another right away"}
{"source": " I've been playing for over 30 years and can say with confidence that this is a great pedal"}
{"source": "I like the sound of this pedal and the ability to get the right over drive sound I want"}
{"source": " I've used it with my reissue 70's Fender Strat plugged into my 1968 vintage Marshal 50 watt head and a slanted 4 cab"}
{"source": " Love the sound"}
{"source": " I am also using this pedal with my Ibanez GB 10 arch top jazz guitar and I am amazed with how good of an over drive I can get!! I've also owned a tube screamer, but I like this one better!!"}
{"source": "I've tried to like this pedal, I really have"}
{"source": "  Maybe it's my signal chain (?)  My experience with the DigiTech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar"}
{"source": "  Sure, the OD is there, but it isn't worth losing your tone, is it?  Again, I reiterate maybe it's just me"}
{"source": "  I have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now"}
{"source": "  And the blue pedal isn't any different, either IMO"}
{"source": "  Grunge was OK, but not my kind of style"}
{"source": "Virtually eliminates all outside sound, allowing you to dial in a comfortable volume during rehersal and recording sessions"}
{"source": "  Nice, flat response"}
{"source": "I got these for noise reduction, barking dogs, loud trucks etc"}
{"source": " They work well for that"}
{"source": " The only drawback is that they fit very tight on my head"}
{"source": " After a time the pinch is bit much"}
{"source": " I have a small (7-1/4) hat size too"}
{"source": " However, the price was great, and the sound is good"}
{"source": " I'm no audiophile, but do play guitar, mando and dulcimer, and for me these phones deliver a good, well rounded sound"}
{"source": "One other thing, these headphones are made for the studio, not for outdoor use"}
{"source": "So, if you can deal with the pinch, I highly recommend these headphones for noise reduction and sound quality"}

{"source": " While I now prefer the latest Direct Sound EX-29s (a vast improvement over my original DS cans, mentioned below), the Firth's are still VERY good and, as a bonus, cost half as much"}

{"source": "I am a professional musician, keyboard player, and keyboard collector (mostly vintage poly analog, but also a ton of mono phonics, modulars, and built your own kit units (shrugging, ambik-) etc - not that that has a lot to do with a pedal, however, I do live the life of a person surrounded by keyboard instruments that I use to make my living"}
{"source": "  have purchased every brand and style of pedal (for the purpose of this, we'll stick with sustain"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "Compared to other units, it is heavier than most and I find the point where sustain engages to be just about right comparing electronic to acoustic"}
{"source": "  It is just an on/off switch, so no half modeling here,The only reason I gave this unit 4 stars instead of 5 is because Yamaha decided not to include a polarity switch and alienate perhaps 20% of the market who will get home and , if they hadn't thought to check, may be stuck wi a pedal that sustains when not being used and stops sustaining when pressed"}
{"source": "  A backward sustain pedal is not fun"}
{"source": "  Many manufacturers include a simple polarity reverse  switch that would eliminate that potential headache"}
{"source": "These days, most keyboards have the option to switch polarity internally either thru a global bemusement or by sensing whether the pedal is engaged at startup and adjusting accordingly (never press the sustain pedal while turning your keyboard on, you may very well cause an issue you don't expect and are confused by - turning on and off again without the pedal depressed will clear everything up in those cases"}
{"source": ")So - build quality, excellent"}
{"source": "  Durability - excellent (I've had a bunch of cheaper pedals - used on stage - break  at the switch point or at the jack), this Yamaha endures"}
{"source": "  Design - some older pedals used to have a flip out rubber footrest that was supposed to make the pedal more secure- I don't see that much anymore, but, so long as you aren't on glossy hardwood, this will stay I place with no issue"}
{"source": "I've read a few reviews that give this pedal a bad rating because of what appears to be a change in a global setting on a keyboard, or something similar,  All a sustain pedal consist of is a momentary contact switch, engaged when contact is made by depressing and completing the circuit, and disengaged when the pedal is released"}
{"source": "  There are no electronics - so - if it doesn't work, there are three points to look at 1) unscrew the jack and be sure that the wires coming from the pedal are all  connected to the metal posts inside the housing"}
{"source": " There are usually two wires of differing color"}
{"source": "  if one is disconnected, the pedal will cease to function (and, in rare instances, cause the keyboard to sustain all notes indefinitely"}
{"source": "  This is easily corrected with a soldering iron and a bit if solder - jacks are points of strain so it isn't inconceivable that a wire could come disconnected"}
{"source": " 2) The switch itself it either out if adjustment or is damaged"}
{"source": "  The switches in the Yamaha pedals are of good quality and unless you received a faulty part, would be unlikely to wear out with normal use"}
{"source": " I have, however, needed to take the pedal apart and made an adjustment"}
{"source": "  this was easy and a quick fix, even with limited tools"}
{"source": "  The third option is 3) the keyboard has had a change in a global setting causing the pedal t operate in reverse"}
{"source": "  This can be corrected by consulting your owners manual and reading whether your keyboard has a software polarity &#34;switch&#34;, if it senses on startup, or if you pedal simply stopped working altogether - doing nothing At all - it is #1 or 2 or a problem with the jack on the keyboard (HIGHLY unlikely,,but I've seen it happen"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": " Hopefully this helps some who have posted questions"}
{"source": "To conclude - a nice pedal for the money, much better build than the m-audio (decent, just not as nice as the Yamaha - certainly not a bad unit)/on stage (if they can't get most of their mic stands right, I don't trust them with even basic electronics"}
{"source": ") or generics"}
{"source": "Does what it should and Yamaha quality"}
{"source": "  The price seems very good for what you get out of this pedal"}
{"source": "  I am using on a Yamaha board"}
{"source": "My first guitar ever, I am happy with it"}
{"source": " I read great reviews here and the price seemed good"}
{"source": " It is a slightly darker color than the picture, as others have mentioned"}
{"source": " And the top part isn't pink like the pic, also as others have mentioned"}
{"source": " It still looks pretty"}
{"source": " I did as another reviewer suggested and replaced the strings with extra light ones (to minimize finger pain) I ordered \"d'addario EJ15-3D phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings, extra light\" in a package of three sets"}
{"source": " And I like those strings better"}
{"source": " The color is nicer (though the originals weren't rusty, they looked new-- others have said their strings were rusty but mine weren't) but most importantly it's easier for a beginner like me to play with lighter (thinner) strings"}
{"source": "I might also do what someone else said and lower the string height by filing down that one part (I am a female and it's already hard enough to press down the strings cause my fingers are shorter than a man's, especially bar chords), but for now this is fine"}
{"source": "I also ordered \"dava 6024 grip tip\" guitar picks, they are nice"}
{"source": " And I got a \"kyser 6-string capo\" in gold and that works well"}
{"source": " And I got a \"planet waves acoustic guitar quick release system\" add-on for my guitar strap to provide more security than the just tying a string to the neck"}
{"source": " The strap I got was a Levy's with pretty floral pattern which is comfortable"}
{"source": " And I got a \"planet waves pro winder\" string winder/cutter which came in handy for re-stringing"}
{"source": " And I bought an acoustic guitar gig bag which I haven't tried yet"}
{"source": " And I keep the guitar sitting on an \"on stage xcg4\" guitar stand"}
{"source": " And I got a string cleaner by fender"}
{"source": "So I write all this in case you were a beginner like me and had no idea what to buy along with your new guitar"}
{"source": " I'll be using mine to sing with, so that's why I needed a capo cause many songs I sing need a capo"}
{"source": " I use a lot of youtube tutorials to learn how to play, and also find tabs/chords on \"ultimate-guitar\" website"}
{"source": " I can tune my guitar for free from using the program on garageband (a music recording program that comes on mac computers) and on garageband there is also a great guitar tutorial video lesson series which has been helpful"}
{"source": " I am very satisfied with my purchase"}
{"source": " It came in a big rectangular box and inside that box was another one that looked like a coffin! Haha it made me laugh"}
{"source": " And inside that was my lovely new guitar"}
{"source": "This is not a toy"}
{"source": "  It's a well crafted instrument"}
{"source": "  Material is wood"}
{"source": "  Decent quality"}
{"source": "  Plain wood but with a nice tone colors to it"}
{"source": "  Good refinements"}
{"source": "  Rings around the hole and stripe on the back"}
{"source": "  Strings had some oxidation"}
{"source": "  Understandable as it was made and shipped from Indonesia"}
{"source": "  Metal strings"}
{"source": "  So that's a consideration if you're a beginner"}
{"source": "  Sounds good too"}
{"source": "  I prefer the sound of a metal guitar anyway"}
{"source": "  So if you're a beginner or an intermediate player who just needs a nice instrument hanging around home for an occasional strum this is it"}
{"source": "  It is a pleasant addition to my home guitars"}
{"source": "  It's for my wife who is learning guitar"}
{"source": "  She loves it"}
{"source": "  And it costs 10% of what mine costs, and I don't mind playing it at all"}
{"source": "  The only plastic is the plate on the front that protects during strumming"}
{"source": "  I don't even have that"}
{"source": "  It's a feel good guitar"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended for the occasional strummer"}
{"source": "After going to various guitar/music stores and trying out many guitars (Yamaha,Ibanez, Fender and others) I researched on the internet and stumbled upon this make/model and saw the MANY positive reviews it had"}
{"source": " I was reluctant to purchase an instrument without playing it first, so I purchased the best sounding guitar locally (costing me $129)"}
{"source": " After 1 day I realized I was unhappy with it still and took a chance and purchased this guitar online"}
{"source": " The many reviews were absolutely correct"}
{"source": " THIS guitar is wonderful and sounds great"}
{"source": " I replaced the strings yet the original strings were just as good as the LIGHT strings I bought"}
{"source": " Even though it is only an $89 guitar, I will treasure this one as if it was $300"}
{"source": " Perfect intonation all the way up to the octave"}
{"source": " Low action and stays in tune for days!"}
{"source": "I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar, it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument"}
{"source": " Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately, and you would be more likely give up"}
{"source": " This, on the other hand, is NOT a low-quality instrument"}
{"source": " Takamine makes many excellent instruments, this included"}
{"source": " It plays very loud and clear, zero buzzing"}
{"source": " If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else, look no further"}
{"source": " I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price"}
{"source": " Note: the package does not include a gig back or case, So I bought this one here, that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)"}
{"source": "Yeah, the strings that it came with were terrible, but it's an amazing guitar"}
{"source": " I'll admit I bought it because it was cheap so I could practice playing on it and not have to worry about it becoming damaged, but it sounds great and plays really well"}
{"source": " I like how the wood finish isn't all slick, has a nice natural feel to it"}
{"source": "This beginner level guitar is very good quality for the price"}
{"source": " It's lightweight and has attractive but basic finishes"}
{"source": " The biggest drawback is that the one I received required the action to be adjusted"}
{"source": " The bridge needed lowered slightly and the nut held the strings way too high above the frets"}
{"source": " The result was very sore fingers"}
{"source": " These are easy fixes if you have the proper tools"}
{"source": " Otherwise you'll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup"}
{"source": " Stock strings have a warm tone"}
{"source": "I've paid hundreds of dollars more for guitars that didn't sound anywhere near as nice and natural as this one does"}
{"source": " And, mind you, I have yet to even change the facory strings out! So if you're looking for a quality guitar at a price that's more than fair, there simply isn't a better deal around"}
{"source": "I didn't know what to expect given the price, but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money"}
{"source": " I am impressed by the quality of materials, components, and construction"}
{"source": " For example, the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed; they work smoothly, and firmly hold the strings in tune"}
{"source": " The instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box; the action didn't seem inordinately high, but I couldn't resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so, and now the guitar plays even better"}
{"source": " I might tinker some more at some point, probably when it comes time to replace the strings, but for now I am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full-bodied dreadnought, which is rich and resonant and very impressive"}
{"source": " I still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price, but the proof is indisputably before me"}
{"source": "I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter"}
{"source": "  She is learning to play guitar and the classical guitar I gave her was just too wide for her little fingers to reach"}
{"source": "  The action on this guitar is perfect and required no set up"}
{"source": "was ready to go out of the box"}
{"source": "  I almost kept it for myself as a knock around guitar it is that nice"}
{"source": "  I have been playing for about 30 years and was really impressed with the quality of this guitar and the sweet, full, rich sound"}
{"source": "  If you are looking at this guitar, buy it!  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"source": "This was my first guitar"}
{"source": "  I've had it for about 5 or 6 years now"}
{"source": "  My wife bought it at a local \"center\" from the recommendation of one of the teachers"}
{"source": "  I taught myself to play on this"}
{"source": "  First the good:  This instrument is a good beginner piece"}
{"source": " It has a nice full sound and does not take steel fingers to make acceptable sounds"}
{"source": "  The tone is very rich and will having even simple chords sounding great"}
{"source": "  The fit and finish of the piece is amazing for the price"}
{"source": " It looks great and had no rough or unfinished areas"}
{"source": "  The frets are smooth and finished and the fingerboard feels good"}
{"source": "  Tuning is a breeze and this will hold tune very well"}
{"source": "  Often only a tweak or 2 before a practice session is all that is needed"}
{"source": "  I have never had it go out of tune while playing (even when stringbending!)  As you get better the true beauty of this guitar starts to shine"}
{"source": "  It is amazingly playable"}
{"source": "  From simple melodies to serious chord jams this instrument handles it all!  The only real compliant I had (and the reason for the 4 stars) is the stock strings aren't the best (IMHO) for a beginner"}
{"source": "  I'm pretty sure they use heavy strings as stock and sure they produce a nice deep rich sound, and WON'T break, they are BRUTAL on new fingers!  I would invest in a lighter set and switch them out pretty early on"}
{"source": "  The only other minor quibble is the bridge seems a bit light duty and their is a tendency to get some string slap on the lower strings"}
{"source": "  All in all this is a great deal for the beginner- or even advanced players that just want an extra guitar around to jam on when they don't feel like dragging out the expensive units (like playing around a campfire, or outdoors)  If your a beginner just starting out- this is a great route to go as the guitar will continue to give great sounds as you advance!"}
{"source": "I recived this guitar today(2/8/13)and its perfect"}
{"source": " After I tuned it it sounded great,it plays well,and it does not hurt my fingers like my old guitar"}
{"source": " This guitar is amazing!"}
{"source": "This is nearly identical to theGuardian Cases CG-020-B Bass Guitar Caseat about half the cost"}
{"source": " However, there are some issues with this case as well as limitations"}
{"source": "First the issues: while the covering appears to be stitched on, it is - for the most part - glued on, and if the case is left in a hot, unventilated space like a car for prolonged periods the covering will start to life at the edges"}
{"source": " On the other hand, someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car (or garage or other storage space) for prolonged periods"}
{"source": " However, you should be aware of the issue, if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers, imagine the effect on your bass"}
{"source": "The limitations are simple: the case, while a hard shell design, is not as strong as one made from ABS plastic"}
{"source": " The top is relatively flimsy as are the sides"}
{"source": " This is not a show stopper if you use the case for home storage and occasional gigs, but if you have a heavy road schedule, and especially of you are not personally loading and unloading the band's gear, this case will not afford you the protection of an ATA-style case"}
{"source": "Also note that I have only used this case for a Fender Jazz Bass, so any long-scale J- or P-style basses will fit"}
{"source": " I cannot be sure about other brands and models"}
{"source": "I mentioned an ATA-style case as a better solution, and it is essential for protecting your instrument if you have heavy road or even local gig schedules"}
{"source": " For less demanding protection I recommend that you also consider this case (which I purchased as an upgrade when I became aware of the issues and limitations of the Musician's Gear model:SKB Electric Bass Rectangular Hardshell, standard latches, handle"}
{"source": "If you still opt for the Musician's Gear case, you are still getting relatively good value and are certainly making a large step up from a soft gig bag"}
{"source": "When I was looking for a Bass Case I just wanted something that was not too expensive and would protect my bass"}
{"source": " This fits the bill perfectly"}
{"source": " It's not really a case that is meant for heavy travel (like checking it a the airport) but it definitely will take good care of your bass during normal travel"}
{"source": " And the internal compartment is really nice for storing straps, cables, strings, etc"}
{"source": " For the price this is an excellent case"}
{"source": "Honestly it took a few adjustments to get it right, but now it works great"}
{"source": "The black handle is a quick release to be used with a drum stick while playing"}
{"source": " After a few tries I got it a good angle so it can be hit while being played"}
{"source": "Height adjustment was also important"}
{"source": " If the latch is to high, it will not grab the hi hat and bring it back up"}
{"source": " Too low and it does not sound right"}
{"source": "This replaced horrible Pulse Hi Hat hardware that shook loose every few songs, so I am completely pleased with it"}
{"source": "definitely worth $13"}
{"source": "00"}
{"source": "good product  great price  works well so far  bought 2 for the price of one of the others  free ship  one for the road  one for pratice"}
{"source": "This is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi-hat pedal, but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top"}
{"source": " This allows you to either ride closed hi-hats when using both bass pedals, yet return to normal hi-hat playing when the music calls for it"}
{"source": "Be aware that this clutch has only two positions - open and fully closed"}
{"source": " However, there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi-hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound"}
{"source": "  I did a work around by placing a spring on the hi-hat stem, with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring, which gives me that opening when I drop the cymbal to closed"}
{"source": "  There was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together, and I was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening"}
{"source": "  Too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound"}
{"source": " Too large or stiff and you will not get the sound"}
{"source": "  However, this is all personal preference, and many drummers ride a fully closed hi-hat anyway, which makes this clutch perfect out of the box"}
{"source": "Regardless of your hi-hat style, if you are using a double bass, this is a \"must have\" accessory"}
{"source": " Gibraltar's model is solid, heavy duty, and engages and disengages perfectly every time"}
{"source": "I like to hit things"}
{"source": " I use drums so nobody else gets hurt"}
{"source": " I need the sticks to most effectively channel my aggression into the drums and not, say, local wildlife"}
{"source": " These have the sweetest tone for battery-based abuse"}
{"source": " Thanks Vic! Also, flammable!"}
{"source": "My 8th graders are literally beating the crap out of these sticks"}
{"source": " They are good and reasonably priced"}
{"source": "  The principal is mad at me because I told them that a real drummer plays constantly, so the walls in the halls, cafeteria tables, and classroom desks are getting pounded constantly"}
{"source": "These sticks are solid hickory, which is insanely durable, and sounds great for classic rock, and punk rock drums"}
{"source": " These sticks are weight, and sound matched, so each pair will sound and feel almost identical"}
{"source": "That guitar sounds magically beautiful for guitar of that level and cost"}
{"source": " It is a great pleasure to jam on it around"}
{"source": " Sound is like it's real big brother"}
{"source": " Very very familiar"}
{"source": "I suppose, it is the best choise for your kid! All hardware is Ok"}
{"source": " Just give some days to tuners to get used to"}
{"source": "I've been interested in learning how to play the guitar for a long time, but the huge problem for me was finding something that was both affordable and made for smaller hands, as I'm rather petite"}
{"source": "  Luckily for me, we found one of these secondhand (it needed minimal repairs)and it's just great"}
{"source": "  I don't know anything about purchasing it new, but I can tell you that this is a great beginner's instrument for someone who has small hands"}
{"source": "  I'll also note that it's even affordable while it's brand new"}
{"source": "The notes are surprisingly clean-sounding coming from a guitar that's so low-priced"}
{"source": " I'd definitely recommend this guitar to anyone who is interested in learning how to play but not interested enough to pay an arm and a leg for an instrument"}
{"source": "The build quality could be better - ideally the nut needs to be replaced (the cut is a rush job) and the neck needs to be reset (there's a gap that indicates that the pocket wasn't completely cleaned out when it was put on) - but what do you expect for this price"}
{"source": " It is however a playable instrument right out of the box and if you're willing to invest another $50 or so it can be a great starter guitar for a"}
{"source": "young (smaller) player or a"}
{"source": "nice travel instrument"}
{"source": "ORIGINAL POSTING:My first Mini, purchased over a decade ago, was a bad investment"}
{"source": " The four neck bolts continually came loose, no amount of tweaking could get the intonation right (Note: adults should probably play the Mini-Strat \"tuned- up\""}
{"source": "I play mine at F - Bb - Eb - G# - C - F"}
{"source": "or, if they have large fingers, they should probably use a capo with standard tuning and heavier strings) so the string tension is similar to their full-sized guitars), the pick-up pole pieces didn't align with the strings, and the finish was uneven"}
{"source": " It cost $99 and I figured I got less than what I paid for"}
{"source": " It was clearly a toy and I sold it for $25 without regret"}
{"source": "Three or four years ago I extensively played a \"Hello Kitty\" Mini owned by a friend"}
{"source": " It cost her $149 and, after I tweaked the intonation and the string height a bit, it was a playable instrument"}
{"source": " I figured she pretty much got what she paid for"}
{"source": " A decent little 3/4-sized traveler"}
{"source": "Recently, after reading that Fender had upped the build quality of their oriental Squier guitars, I again purchased a Mini"}
{"source": " I couldn't be more pleased"}
{"source": " Right out of the box, everything about the instrument was spot-on"}
{"source": " The construction was rock solid, the neck was straight, the strings were correctly positioned, the intonation was exact, and the finish was flawless"}
{"source": " It was, in two words, masterfully made"}
{"source": " I figure I got at least $249 worth of guitar for $99"}
{"source": " How cool is that?The sound of the current Mini is \"classic Fender single-coil\""}
{"source": "shimmering with bell-like overtones"}
{"source": " The pickups are functional, if a bit thin sounding compared to the Seymour Duncans I have on my full-size Strat"}
{"source": " The six-in-line enclosed tuners hold the light gauge strings without slipping"}
{"source": " The neck is perfectly finished and fast"}
{"source": " Because it's a 3/4-sized guitar, the first and second-fret string spacing might be too tight for adult players with large fingers"}
{"source": " But for everyone else, including fortunate children, the current Mini is a sweet ride"}
{"source": " And at its present \"give away\" street value, this has to be one of the most fantastic bargains in the musical kingdom! Bravo Fender!June, 2014 UPDATE:The mini has become my preferred, go-to electric"}
{"source": " I now have one for jazz with a single Lace Hot Gold in the middle position with a custom pick guard from Chandler Music's Pickguard Heaven (see attached photo) and a very versatile one with a Lace Red, Silver, and Blue pickup set"}
{"source": " Why? For the same reason John Lennon once owned a 3/4-sized guitar, I suppose"}
{"source": " Obscure chords and finger patterns are easier on the hands because fingers have to span less distance"}
{"source": " I believe the slight tonal inaccuracy of the 3/4 scale is offset by increased finger-placement accuracy"}
{"source": " Try it and I think you'll like it!"}
{"source": "I've been playing over 30 years and got one of these for my 7-year-old because he wants to play guitar like daddy does"}
{"source": "  For $100 it's an OK starter guitar for a kid (and I guess really short people who can't play a regular Fender), but not something I'd recommend to anyone else"}
{"source": "  And my kid thinks it looks cool, so he'll be more likely to stick with it"}
{"source": "Even though it has a laminated body, the headstock and unfinished neck are decent wood"}
{"source": "  The frets are crowned OK but have some sharp ends to them, and I feel silly investing the cash to have them fixed"}
{"source": "  It's light and easy to handle"}
{"source": "  The hardware isn't bad, with a stable bridge (good idea not to put a floating trem in this), 5-way blade switch, solid jack and strap anchors, and smooth knobs"}
{"source": "  The pickups are not top notch but work well enough (a decent replacement set would cost more than the whole guitar does, so I'm not complaining)"}
{"source": "  It has a nice red paint job"}
{"source": "On the down side, besides some sharp fret ends, it required a few truss rod and bridge adjustments to bring the action close to where it should be"}
{"source": "  The fretboard uses cheap rosewood and in one spot has some extra glue showing around a fret"}
{"source": "  The nut on the one I got is sunk lower on the treble side than on the bass side, so the low E string is farther from the fretboard than the other strings"}
{"source": "  It has one small pit in the red finish"}
{"source": "  It has no paperwork or owner's manual"}
{"source": "  The tuners are kind of choppy"}
{"source": "  And the body/neck flexes so if you put too much pressure on it the whole thing will go out of tune"}
{"source": "It comes strung with Fender 9's, which combined with the short scale makes the strings loose and easy to press down, so it's good for a kid just starting out"}
{"source": "  I actually enjoy messing around with it because the pickups have a punkish scratchy sound"}
{"source": "  But as soon as he gets bigger we'll ditch this for something better"}
{"source": "I had a lot of questions and concerns when I ordered this"}
{"source": " Well, it arrived today, I've been playing it for the past few hours, and here's the answers to those questions:1"}
{"source": " Is it worth the money?Absolutely yes"}
{"source": " This is an amazing bargain"}
{"source": " There are better guitars out there, but not for $170"}
{"source": " This really is a great deal"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " How does it sound?Fantastic"}
{"source": " It's definitely \"bright\", which a few of the other reviews pointed out, but it also has new strings on it, so it might be a little too early to judge"}
{"source": " That said, it's got a nice full sound and if you play up closer to the neck you get more bass in the mix"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " How's the action?Just right"}
{"source": " Low enough that it's easy to play (for a 12 string) but no buzzing strings"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " How about the neck?Wider than a 6 string, but not much"}
{"source": " Probably a centimeter or so wider"}
{"source": " I have small hands and had no problem playing it"}
{"source": " The main thing is the added pressure it takes to push down twice as many strings as normal"}
{"source": "5"}
{"source": " How does it play?Great"}
{"source": "6"}
{"source": " How does it look?Great"}
{"source": " Nice natural finish, all shiny and new"}
{"source": " What's not to love? (Note: the picture shows a more whitish finish, but it's a normal natural finish like you'd see on most acoustic guitars"}
{"source": " Natural wood color"}
{"source": "So if any of you guitarists have been thinking of buying an acoustic 12 string, take a look at this one for sure"}
{"source": " I wish I'd bought it long ago"}
{"source": " There are just some songs that need to be played on a 12 string"}
{"source": "I wanted a 12 string, but did not want to spend a lot of money, this guitar fits the bill"}
{"source": " The finish is much darker then the pictures online show"}
{"source": " GREAT SOUND from this bad boy"}
{"source": " This is a BIG GUITAR, once I figured out how to tune the 12 string, it really DOES NOT GO OUT OF TUNE"}
{"source": " After I few hours of play, I retune it and its marginally out of tune, I thought at this price the tuners would be of poor quality, while they are not grover tuners, they get it done"}
{"source": "The downside for me is, not the guitar's fault"}
{"source": " this is an inexpensive guitar and a FANTASTIC entry into 12 string playing, this Guitar is hard to play below the 15th fret as there is no cut away, but that is true of all guitars using this body type"}
{"source": " Now that I have had it awhile I would love for it to be acoustic/electric but again"}
{"source": " for the price, I was expecting an inferior guitar this tool plays great low action"}
{"source": " Im keeping it"}
{"source": "I knew I did right by buying the DR-212"}
{"source": " It's great and stands up to much more expensive of it's kind"}
{"source": "I have lots of Gibsons as well as Epiphones and frankly I don't see any difference to speak of"}
{"source": " If anybody wants a durable acoustic 12 string with fine sound you'll find it in the DR-212"}
{"source": "Best of Luck to allRegards,Roger  Epiphone DR-212 Acoustic Guitar, 12-String, Natural"}
{"source": "First off, let's get the dimensions out of the way; for some reason, finding these basic dimensions on a lot of guitars and cases is close to impossible; just try to find the dimensions of the DR-212 on the Epiphone web site"}
{"source": "Length: 43\",  Bout length: 19-7/8\",  Lower bout thickness: 4-3/4\",  Lower bout width: 15-1/2\"So now you can look for a gig bag with the full knowlage of what size guitar you are trying to squeeze into it"}
{"source": "The only thing that is out of the norm with these dimensions, is the 43\" length (Most bags are 39\"-41\")"}
{"source": "You can always opt for the Epiphone hard case: EDREAD, or World Tour RWG20D, or GBA100 (the bag I got)"}
{"source": "Now that the hard part is out of the way (finding a case), on to the review"}
{"source": "As my title says, the guitar reminds me of my Samick ST92 which is a VERY well made 3/4 Spruce top acoustic which is also made in Indonesia"}
{"source": "I have played guitar for over 40 years, so I  have a collection of over 100 guitars, and 11 of them are acoustics, but this is the first12 string, and I bought it just to have it around for songs like Hotel California, Etc"}
{"source": ", and was not willing to drop a lot of money on a guitar I would rarely use"}
{"source": "I am very impressed with the build quality of this guitar for the under $170"}
{"source": "00 asking price"}
{"source": " It tuned up with no problems, even though the tuning process is arduous compared to a six string, and it takes about three tunings to get the strings stretched out"}
{"source": " You constantly think you will pull the bridge out due to all that string pressure"}
{"source": " The bridge plate on these 12 strings must be huge!I found that when tuning, you should up stroke the small strings so that you don't hit the large one right next to it"}
{"source": "I have no fret buzz, finger rash, or problem areas with the fretboard on my guitar, and the strings sit low which I like"}
{"source": "The nut is a bit sharp on the edges, but a file or sanding will take care of that"}
{"source": "The strings are not that bad, and will do until the first change out"}
{"source": "I have seen a wide range of reviews on this guitar, from terrible to fantastic, but the one I have is the later"}
{"source": "Very playable right out of the Box and very beautiful"}
{"source": " I have a Epiphone Swingster, Nighthawk and Violin Bass and they are all great products! I decided to give it a good set up"}
{"source": " After the Strings were off I sanded down the Bridge 1-2 mm and adjusted the neck just a little"}
{"source": " Then I want to really recommend Martin Bronze Strings light or extra light (green box) for an awesome sound and easy playability which is important on 12 Strings"}
{"source": " Instructional videos can be viewed on YouTube before you go for it or you get a Guitar Tech to do it"}
{"source": "Ps Matching Epiphone cases are available and so are inexpensive clip on pickups if you want to go thru an Amp or line in recording"}
{"source": "Ps The Tuners are a bit to close to each other in my opinion"}
{"source": " When you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner"}
{"source": "I was really torn about getting this because of its price but decided to take the plunge and have no regrets"}
{"source": " The action is better than my six string Epiphone acoustic"}
{"source": " It sounds so sweet, looks so sweet, and plays so sweet"}
{"source": " I keep it tuned down a half step and use a capo to protect the neck"}
{"source": " I would definitely recommend this especially if your on a budget"}
{"source": " It stays in tune and don't let the laminated top scare you, its great"}
{"source": "I have an older version of this model, but it works great"}
{"source": "  I opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that I got from Home depot"}
{"source": "  2 hangers rated to hold up to 75 lbs each equals 150 lbs worth of peace of mind!  The hanger itself that I bought was used, so it was already assembled, so I can't comment too much on the assembly process"}
{"source": "  I bought 2 of them, and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry-free security!  And no, I don't own stock in the company!  :-)"}
{"source": "I actually have five of these for the various instruments, mostly bass guitars but also an acoustic and a solid-body electric"}
{"source": "When mounted properly to studs - the only way I have mounted these - they are very, very solid"}
{"source": " While in a nice package with instructions and hardware for wall board fasteners, I used longish brass wood screws to studs for appearance and strength"}
{"source": " You do see the ends of the screws used after install is complete, and to me a brass screw looks great with this &#34;flat black&#34; model"}
{"source": "The CC11 model -- this one -- works well with any kind of guitar including bass or acoustic"}
{"source": " There are variants for other instruments, but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit"}
{"source": " The yoke width is adjustable, and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder"}
{"source": "Recommended"}
{"source": "but do consider you means of mounting carefully"}
{"source": "its cheap and the quality its great cant complain"}
{"source": " i will be buying more of this in the future for other guitars"}
{"source": "I used this on the side of a wooden bookshelf for my ukulele"}
{"source": "  It's attractive"}
{"source": "  It's well made"}
{"source": " It's fork is a tad large for the ukulele  It has rubber o-rings that slide, so I can bring them in and the uke does fit then"}
{"source": "  But then, even the three inch deep uke is close to the bookcase (or wall, if you use it there)"}
{"source": "  The uke hits when I put it in the hanger, so I put a felt pad where the uke body hits the bookcase"}
{"source": "Many uke players simply nail a single nail in the wall and use a loop off string from it around the uke head and tuners"}
{"source": "  This is much less expensive, holds very well, is even more low profile than this hanger, and never drops a uke"}
{"source": " Consider it for your needs"}
{"source": "I'd not buy another of these for a ukulele"}
{"source": "  It likely works fine for a guitar, though"}
{"source": "I deducted one point for the fact that, even though it's adjustable (the o-rings), and advertised for ukes, it doesn't work well for them"}
{"source": "  And it's heavy and not stylish, in my opinion"}
{"source": "  I have the Hercules wall hanger (mechanical gripper) for my electric guitars, and it's fabulous (for guitars; overkill for lightweight ukuleles, maybe)"}
{"source": "Hercules Stands Wallmount Guitar Hanger GSP39WBUpdate 9/7/11: the more I use it, the less I like it"}
{"source": "  I find that friction tuner ukuleles do not fit on it well at all, and the tuners hit the fork and it can make your uke out of tune"}
{"source": "  So, for small instruments (you'd have to try it yourself with mandolins and banjos), this is atrocious"}
{"source": "  For guitars, it's not as good as Hercules"}
{"source": "Purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home"}
{"source": "  I saw them used in a guitar shop so I assumed they were more than sufficient for use at home"}
{"source": " I'm using them with both acoustic and electric guitars"}
{"source": " They appear to be designed to hang the guitar away from the wall to avoid abrasions on the back and they do just that"}
{"source": " The hooks can be stretched apart or squeezed together to fit the headstock of the guitar"}
{"source": "  Overall, they are attractive, well-made hangars"}
{"source": "This is a great music stand, I like how it's adjustable in various ways to customize it to the exact position you need it in"}
{"source": "  It's very sturdy and well built"}
{"source": "  I don't ever worry that it'll tip over"}
{"source": "  I love it"}
{"source": "  I would recommend it"}
{"source": "Solid constructions with enough room for my sheet music"}
{"source": "  Very portable, though the holder can be a challenge at times"}
{"source": "  I have another stand that collapses into a very compact unit, but if you have heavy tomes that you wish to use or several sheets that you want to string "}
{"source": "  this unit is superior"}
{"source": "This music stand is og great quality and of a great price"}
{"source": "I have been very pleased with it"}
{"source": " I have bought On-Stage stands in the past before, so i was sure that I wouldn't be disaapointed and I was right"}
{"source": "Very sturdy-well built-good price"}
{"source": "I'm very happy with this stand"}
{"source": "  It is heavy, which I knew going in"}
{"source": "  But for my purposes, that is a plus"}
{"source": "  The weight makes it more sturdy"}
{"source": "  It folds up compactly, so it is quite portable, despite the weight"}
{"source": "  Adjusts easily and holds its position"}
{"source": "Purchased after another folding stand which cost the same $$$ literally fell apart"}
{"source": "  This one is much better although not quite as portable"}
{"source": "  On the plus side, music stays put on this one, it's very stable and the height is fully adjustable"}
{"source": "  You can buy with confidence"}
{"source": "I left my trusty Manhasset behind on a job and was about to replace it when I came upon this alternative offered by Amazon"}
{"source": "  As banged up as a Manhasset can get from week-end warriors like me who simply throw it on top of everything else in the backseat before the long ride home, I've never had one fail on me over the past 40+ years"}
{"source": "  There's nothing on the stand that the user can even adjust, yet all of the moving parts always seem to retain just the right amount of tension, preventing 5-10 pound folders from lowering the top half or causing it to dip forward"}
{"source": "  But the \"rub\" is their non-adaptability"}
{"source": "  The feet on the base are permanently attached as is the upper tray holding the music"}
{"source": "  Consequently, these ubiquitous, well-proven stands can sometimes be a challenge to pack in a crowded van or sedan, especially with a couple of keyboards, amps, instrument stands, and other requisite gear on board"}
{"source": "This is where Amazon's On-Stage Music Stand becomes attractive (of course, it doesn't hurt that it costs less than a Manhasset)"}
{"source": "  It permits you to fold up the legs to a position parallel with the shaft as well as to completely remove the upper shelf that holds the music"}
{"source": "  Consequently, it's much easier to find a convenient place--whether in the trunk or on the floor of the back seat--for packing the stand"}
{"source": "  Simply \"slide\" it into position"}
{"source": "The drawback--apart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about (be careful not to over-tighten those set-screws!)--is that this thing is heavy"}
{"source": "  Frankly, I was expecting a lightweight stand, at least compared to my old Manhasset, but if you've owned or been around the latter, the first thing you're likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable, substantial addition in weight"}
{"source": " At the same time, with the moving parts and the set screws (topped by plastic, rotating, serrated wheels), the On-Stage stand doesn't give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the Manhasset--in other words, I'm very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gear-pile after a long, exhausting 4-hour gig"}
{"source": "Bottom line: the On-Stage appears to be a good value--a truly heavy-duty stand (in most respects) that'll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room and that packs up conveniently for traveling jobs"}
{"source": "  But don't expect it to lighten your load or, simply because it's heavier, to last longer than a Manhasset"}
{"source": "If you do a lot of traveling and don't plan to put one of those 1000-page piano folders on the stand, there's at least one truly lightweight (albeit plastic) stand that's worked out really well for me (perhaps needless to say, some haven't--they fall apart or they're so ingeniously designed that it takes 15 minutes simply to disassemble them and put them back in their unforgiving, pint-sized cases)"}
{"source": "  But the Peak stand is made to hold up (in turn, it holds up relatively heavy music books) and has served me well for several years (just as I was about to condemn the stand, I called the company, they responded immediately by sending out a critical plastic piece that had become warped, and the Peak stand has been problem-free ever since)"}

{"source": "CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right"}
{"source": "never again"}
{"source": "I was using slinkys for several years but decided to give these a shot because the slinkys kept corroding so quickly"}

{"source": "  Well, you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar"}

{"source": "  If you use strings, you should buy them your damn self"}
{"source": "  While you're at it, buy ten sets"}
{"source": "  Seriously, are you a child?  Always have extra strings"}
{"source": "  D'Addarios last a long time for me, and they sound good"}
{"source": "  Also, they're on the bottom end of the price range"}

{"source": "Put my Schecter C-1 Custom FR in Drop Bb, these strings sound great and have a great low end"}
{"source": " Highly reccomend"}
{"source": "I have played on D'addario Before,  actually the first string I started out on"}
{"source": "Super light's are ok,  but can wear out real fast,  So, It's importent not to put to much stess on  them"}
{"source": "espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's,  etc  they will break"}
{"source": "  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning"}
{"source": "any strings,I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's,  cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out"}
{"source": "Personally,  I don't like D'addario's at all,  I find the tone to bright"}
{"source": "My son has been a guitarist for seven years and loves these strings"}
{"source": " Not a single one has broken since he started using these three weeks ago"}
{"source": " These strings tend to repel the dirt and dust even with heavy play the strings look very good"}
{"source": " He has been getting less callous on his fingers"}
{"source": " The tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price"}
{"source": " My son has a very heavy hand but these strings are well made and withstand play from any style"}
{"source": "The gauges are identical to Ernie Ball Regulars (yellow label) but the D'Addario's string tension feels stiffer, which is nice for slide playing"}
{"source": " I like my action medium-low, comfortable for straight playing and bending, solid intonation for chords, yet not too much fret rattle for slide"}
{"source": "I usually stretch the heck out of Ernie Ball's after putting them on because they have so much spring in them"}
{"source": " I deliberately left the D'Addarios unstretched overnight and found they settled in nicely without much stretching at all"}
{"source": " Their new sound is quite bright as advertised, but has far less of what I call `new string jangle', which is fine by me"}
{"source": " As a kid, I'd sweat that off in an hour but these days, playing a number of instruments, it can last awhile"}
{"source": "There's a string tension chart, handy for designing a custom set and each pack has a serial number"}
{"source": "  I'll admit I'd never considered the possibility guitar strings were worthwhile targets for counterfeiting, but apparently that's the case and D'Addario provides a web site lookup to verify your set"}
{"source": " If you do come across fakes, if you're willing to report it, they'll provide you with a genuine replacement for free"}
{"source": "I've used D'Addario phosphor-bronze acoustic strings on guitars and mandolins for over 25 years and swear by their quality and consistency"}
{"source": " I've used Ernie Ball's on electrics for even longer"}
{"source": " Habits can be tough to break but, as my playing has broadened out from my rock roots, I find it interesting to experiment with different gauges and windings"}
{"source": " Finally nailing a sound and feel you've been chasing after for years makes it all worth it"}
{"source": "I ended up settling on these as being my favorite strings years ago"}
{"source": "  Ultimately, they're simply the best for the money"}
{"source": "  You can get them for less than $3 per pack, if you shop around"}
{"source": "As I stated about some other guitar strings I purchased here, these D'Addarios for my electric guitar give me the sound, service and price point I need!"}
{"source": "Been using these for years"}
{"source": "  I like the Regular Slinkies, too, but it seems these tend to last longer"}
{"source": "  Or, it could just be in my head"}
{"source": "  Either way, I am happy with them"}
{"source": "In my opinion, D'Addario is the standard by which all other strings are measured"}
{"source": " I keep trying different brands from the cheap to the boutique, and I always keep coming back to D'Addario"}
{"source": " Extremely versatile, stable and they last as long as can be reasonably expected of any non coated string"}

{"source": "010-"}
{"source": "046I installed these strings on a Schecter Diamond Serier Acoustic - Electric HybridC-1 E/A in order to test the sound using both acoustic and electric settings"}
{"source": " The strings were easy to work with on installation"}
{"source": "In particular, I liked the color coding of the strings vs the traditional individuallywrapped strings"}
{"source": " The color coding makes it hard to accidentally mix similar strings and ismore environmentally friendly in terms of packaging"}
{"source": " Also, the sealed packet wouldappear to keep the strings from oxidizing longer"}
{"source": "The strings tuned up quickly and reached stable tuning within a very short time frame"}
{"source": "After only about an hour they needed only slight tuning adjustment and were ready to go"}
{"source": "First, I tried the Hybrid using a clean acoustic setting and the string produced a surprisingly nice range of sound, especially in the lower registers"}
{"source": " This was a bit unexpected because of the \"bright\" label on the package"}
{"source": " I actually prefer a widerrange of frequencies so this was a nice bonus"}
{"source": " The highs were clean and bright"}
{"source": "Using the Bernard Butler setting on the Line 6 Amp I tried the electric side of the Hybrid"}
{"source": "The action of the strings was light and fast and notes could be comfortably bent"}
{"source": " The sound produced was very similar to that of the more expensive strings that previously were on the guitar, which leads me to my closing point"}
{"source": "Overall, I was very pleased with the performance of these strings and when you consider the fact that they only cost around $3,  D'Addario EXL110's will be put in my \"Best Buy\" category for future purchases"}
{"source": "D'Addario Strings are not my usual strings, I have always used GHS and Ernie Ball Strings"}
{"source": "To my surprise D'Addario Strings are very nice, however after 20+ years of GHS and Ernie Ball Strings it's tough for me to make a full time change over to D'Addario Strings"}
{"source": "After tons of experimenting, I settled on the EXL116 for D standard and E flat standard"}
{"source": " I've tried 10-52 but the top is a little too floppy for D and that makes notes sound out of tune if you don't press the string just right"}
{"source": " Also tried 11-56 and while that gives a real solid and full rhythm tone, the attack is too rounded due to the pick taking longer to travel over a wider string"}
{"source": " That reduces articulation"}
{"source": " So while you get a fuller sound with the 56, you get more dynamics and attack with the 52, and the latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier"}
{"source": " You can EQ fullness into a rhythm track, but you can't add in pick attack and greater dynamics"}
{"source": "Tension wise, at D standard 11-56 is ideal but 11-52 is doable"}
{"source": " Sound wise, 11-52 has been best for my metal recordings and that's why I'm sticking with the EXL116 set from now on"}
{"source": " I also replaced the G string with a 20 gauge wound for better sounding power chords"}
{"source": " And compared to Ernie Balls, D'addarios start off less bright but maintain their brightness longer, thus a more even and predictable response over time"}
{"source": "There seems to be a lot of know it alls when it comes to this case"}
{"source": " One reviewer says it's made by Fender"}
{"source": " I seriously doubt that and have to wonder on what he bases that on"}
{"source": " Show me proof"}
{"source": " Someone else seems to think it's made by Epiphone"}
{"source": " Sorry to disappoint you but Epiphone doesn't make cases"}
{"source": " They accept bids from case manufacturers who can build a case to thier specifications at the lowest cost"}
{"source": " I have several Epiphone 335 Dots and a Gibson ES335"}
{"source": " I bought Epiphone cases for all of them"}
{"source": " I found the Gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case"}
{"source": " I couldn't see any sense in paying more money just for the Gibson name"}
{"source": " My Gibson fits perfectly in the Epiphone case"}
{"source": " Although the cases have the Epiphone logo on the outside, they are all made by TKL"}
{"source": " How do I know that you're wondering? They have a TKL tag on the inside of the accessory compartment"}
{"source": " That's been a few years ago"}
{"source": " The cases you get now could be made by a different company"}
{"source": " The case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar"}
{"source": " Regardless of who actually makes the case, it has to meet Epiphone's manufacturing standards so it's got to be good"}
{"source": " This case will fit The 335 Dot, Casino, Sheraton and the Gibson ES335"}
{"source": " Anyone who knows anything about guitars knows that the Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor II has a much thicker body than the 335 Dot"}
{"source": " This case was not intended for the Emperor II"}
{"source": " It's a great case and will protect your guitar, but it's not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car"}
{"source": " I just bought two more of these cases for my Harmony Rockets"}
{"source": " One is a single cutaway reissue and the other is a vintage double cutaway"}
{"source": " Both guitars fit perfectly"}
{"source": "As a lot of Epiphone owners have learned, cases designed for the Gibson ES-335 clones won't fit Epiphone guitars, as the Epiphones have a slightly larger headstock"}
{"source": " This case, however, fits my Dot Custom like a glove"}
{"source": " The padding is perfect, the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar, and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level"}
{"source": "Didn't expect much for the price but this is a top notch case for any of the Epiphone - Gibson  Semi-Hollowbody Guitars - Great Deal to protect your investment!!"}
{"source": "I got this for my Epi Sheraton II:PROS:  It fits perfectly; it's \"fur\" lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five), but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over, two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side, and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin"}
{"source": "CONS:  It's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some \"Made in China\" characteristics"}
{"source": "I've had several cases and this is one of the nicest"}
{"source": "  On a personal level, I'd prefer it didn't say \"Epiphone\" on the outside"}
{"source": "  But since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 Gibson 335"}
{"source": "When my case arrived I feared it was too small to hold my Epiphone Dot"}
{"source": " But, this case fits my Dot like a glove"}
{"source": " The case is sturdy enough to protect my guitar from knocks and dings while the plush inside pampers the guitar's finish"}
{"source": " The accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks, tuner, and extra strings"}
{"source": "It's survived my clumsiness and I can load it with 4 pounds of guitar books without it breaking a sweat"}

{"source": "There is no doubt in my mind that you will be impressed with the quality this microphone has to offer your home studio or voice-over applications"}
{"source": " It does well and minimizing the air pressure impact of the room and it humbly presents any voice with great clarity and a bassy tone"}
{"source": " NOTE: use a good preamp or a external EQ"}
{"source": "I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say, after researching condenser microphones for several months, countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say, this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more"}
{"source": "Here's another interesting fact"}
{"source": " I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;, Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig"}
{"source": " well I found out he uses a 990 as well"}
{"source": " So, think about it, perfect for the amateur, perfect for the professional"}
{"source": " and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy"}
{"source": "$49 for a $199 microphone at Amazon? May not be the best mic out there but for home studios, this one marks the spot"}
{"source": " Get it if you're on a budget"}
{"source": "I love this product"}
{"source": " It came fast, included extra shockmount line, shockmount, an adapter, the mic, instructions, and a very durable and protective case of easy transporting"}
{"source": " The sound quality is great with the Art Tube Preamp(use mic cables, not 1/4\" cables for Phantom Power), and I couldn't be happier with it"}
{"source": " It even looks impressive"}
{"source": " Although, I do have to say that online the product looks silver and shiny, when in reality it is this \"off-silver\" color"}
{"source": " Almost a gold, but not quite"}
{"source": " It's not bad or anything, just different"}
{"source": " And frankly, the thing could be purple for all I care- as long as it produces great sound, that's all that matters"}
{"source": " Great product, and extremely affordable"}
{"source": " No complaints"}
{"source": "The MXL 990 sounds just as every bit as good as some very expensive mikes I have used"}
{"source": " Just like with any condenser mike it's a good idea to invest in a decent pop filter if you don't want those annoying popping P's in your recordings"}
{"source": " I would recommend this mike to anyone for vocals or miking acoustic guitars in your recording studio or portastudio"}
{"source": " Also a great mike for doing voiceovers"}
{"source": "[review updated after more time spent with the mic]Well, there's definitely some detail missing in the mids, but it has a generally pleasing \"very fat\" (aka muddy) tone"}
{"source": " Makes a fair snare drum mic"}
{"source": " Needs a bit of EQ for almost any practical application"}
{"source": " I don't think I'd use it to track the vocals on anything, but it works"}
{"source": " You'd be better off with a similarly-priced small-diaphragm condenser and a windscreen"}
{"source": "man ya'll yall better quick get this here mic yo cuz it's all good and stuff man"}

{"source": "Was very pleased with JP 600L PB acoustic guitar strings"}
{"source": " I wipe the strings with a Planet Waves microfiber cloth each time after playing and it seemed like they would last forever"}
{"source": " Plus the tone of the bass strings was improved over the D'Addario EJ16 light I had been using that were installed by the factory, so I kept replacing with like kind"}
{"source": " 600L is the exact same string gauges"}
{"source": "I read a review on Shorline Music (an Amazon affiliate) about the John Pearse 710 NM PB and after trying those I like them even better than the 600L"}
{"source": " They keep most of the same bass strings as the 600L (A, D, and G) but add some strings from the medium size: low E ("}
{"source": "055 replacing "}
{"source": "053) and high E and B each increasing "}
{"source": "001, from "}
{"source": "012 to "}
{"source": "013, and "}
{"source": "016 to "}
{"source": "017"}
{"source": "I had a concern about my ability to bend the B string using little finger only in blues F chord position - no problem"}
{"source": "The improvement in tone is in all the right places"}
{"source": " Very nice"}
{"source": " Yet the overall tension of the set is increasing only very slightly under 10 pounds total, from the 162"}
{"source": "2 lbs"}
{"source": " for the D'Addario light"}
{"source": "I play fingerstyle only and this set is said to be ideal for fingerstyle offering a balanced tension across all strings"}
{"source": "I suppose things are always subject to change, but for now, I am amazed and delighted with these strings"}
{"source": " You wouldn't think a simple string change could make much of a difference, but somehow these do"}
{"source": "I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop"}
{"source": " I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup"}
{"source": " This is my first set and I am impressed"}
{"source": " These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned, but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp"}
{"source": "I would purchase these again for my needs"}
{"source": " Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form, but great also"}
{"source": " It would be a toss up for me between the two, but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously"}
{"source": "I have a few Planet Waves products and I can safely recommend them"}
{"source": "  This is no different, it works, I have no issues with the product, if you are looking for a peg winder,  or any accessory, I'd recommend you look at Planet Waves among your research in brands"}
{"source": "Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help"}
{"source": "These picks work well and look as pictured"}
{"source": " The shade of pink is very close to that in the picture"}
{"source": " I would recommend them"}
{"source": "There's not much to say about this pick"}
{"source": " I like medium picks and this feels comfortable"}
{"source": "They wear a bit faster than I would expect, but far rom being a problem"}
{"source": " It may just be my style"}
{"source": "The 12-pack seems a good balance between cost and quantity"}
{"source": "this piece of plastic is just terrible"}
{"source": "  you'd be better off with a couple of books and a towel"}
{"source": "not recommended!"}
{"source": "A big help on the workbench when working on either guitar or bass"}
{"source": "  Seems sturdy enough"}
{"source": "  I side on safety so I use a soft cloth for extra protection, but this item does what it was designed to and should last a long time"}
{"source": "What a great little stand"}
{"source": " I love using this thing when it comes time to polish my guitars or to change their strings"}
{"source": " I also like the fact it folds up, taking up very little space when its stored away"}
{"source": " The rubber pads are plentiful and molded to the plastic, so there's no need to worry about one coming loose and marring the finish of your guitar neck"}
{"source": "This gets the job done but because it is lighter you do a bit of &#34;chasing&#34; the guitar around"}
{"source": " All in all gets the job"}
{"source": "For those of you who change strings on your guitar or mandolin or just about any other string insterment this is a must have"}
{"source": "Holds up your insterment while changing strings-- your insterment doest slide around on you"}
{"source": " and it folds up"}
{"source": " keep it right in your case"}
{"source": " very cool tool to have  Thanks"}
{"source": "You know, if you do guitar work, you need a neck stand"}
{"source": " Some sheets+stand units cost $50"}
{"source": " This was what I needed and it was cheap"}
{"source": " So far so good"}
{"source": "great little tool to assist you while replacing strings, cleaning or tuning, keeps headstock still and then folds up neatly to fit in a drawer, kit or pocket"}
{"source": "Works great for changing out the strings on ones guitar"}
{"source": "  Compact enough that it's able to be stored in your case if you want or if you have a tech box that you bring with you"}
{"source": "It makes restringing way easier it's pretty stable and sturdy"}
{"source": " It will work on pretty much any guitar"}
{"source": " So far iv used it on my 6,7 electrics and my Taylor acoustic"}
{"source": "This is a needed tool when changing strings on guitars especially if you change your stringws often as I do"}
{"source": "  I've tried other types including those that I made myself but I much prefer this one"}
{"source": "  I find it ight and solid and cradels well the nect of any of my guitars"}
{"source": "from Fender, Takamine, Ovations"}
{"source": "etc"}
{"source": " For the cost it is worth it and can easily take it with you in your guitar case when travelling"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": "Sweet little neck stand"}
{"source": "  Very light weight"}
{"source": "  Folds compact to fit in your guitar's hard case or gig bag"}
{"source": "  Padded to protect guitar neck"}
{"source": "In the case of you change the guitar strings, or in case you just make a revision setup, this item is very useful, because the guitar will be land and the her body will stay firmly attached"}
{"source": "This was very convenient, easy to use, weighs next to nothing and takes even less space than I had expected"}
{"source": " Recommended"}
{"source": "I do all my own guitar maintenance, which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings, etc"}
{"source": "  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose, but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench"}
{"source": "  So, looking around on Amazon, I found this handy little device"}
{"source": "  It's small, works well, and fairly inexpensive"}
{"source": "  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust"}
{"source": "  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction"}
{"source": "  But don't get me wrong, it's still pretty strong"}
{"source": " just don't put too much weight on it while using it"}
{"source": "Go build your own"}
{"source": " Build it to your specs and have a solid stand"}
{"source": " If not, you can find a lot better head stands"}
{"source": " This one was a huge disappointment"}
{"source": " Does not do what it says and can get you frustrated quick"}
{"source": " Im back with my wood block and am happy"}
{"source": "This little geegaw is a stable tripod stand to hold the neck of your guitar while you restring it or perform other work"}
{"source": " It folds into a nice small package you can store in the gear compartment of most cases"}
{"source": " The rubber pads on the neck end prevent scratches and the feet keep it in place on the table"}
{"source": " It may be best to invest in a non slip pad to place under the heel of the guitar body for protection and to prevent it from slipping around as movement can topple the stand if you're not careful"}
{"source": " Sure, a suitably sized cardboard box or stack of books will also serve that purpose, but what else would you spend the $10 on?"}
{"source": "I ordered these picks in bulk to use while I was recording/producing"}
{"source": " I absolutely love these picks and swear by them"}
{"source": " I've been a guitarist for almost 7 years and these were the picks that I landed on years ago and stuck to"}
{"source": " I've had years of lessons, licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me! Perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for Rhythms"}
{"source": " I'd order again if I had to"}
{"source": "I started playing mandolin back in September and bought a lot of different picks to try to find the type that would work best for my playing, and finally decided on the Dunlop Jazz Stubby 3"}
{"source": "00mm picks"}
{"source": "  Once I determined that it was the best pick for me it was an easy decision to buy a package of them so that I won't ever be without one"}
{"source": "  Picks have a habit of disappearing just when you need them most -- buying them in bulk this way means that I'll always have them available and can even share them with others if the opportunity arises"}
{"source": "This pick is so good to play electric guitar! It is heavy and small, what gave us attack"}
{"source": " Make the sound clean and bright"}
{"source": "These are the thickest picks I've ever used"}
{"source": "  However, I am really liking them"}
{"source": "  The tone they give seems better to my ears than anything I've tried and my speed picking has improved"}
{"source": "I've tried every standard pick - even bone, silver & really expensive ones"}
{"source": " These little Dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite - and they're cheap! Great on guitar and also *awesome* on mandolin"}
{"source": " They are small, which takes getting used to, though"}
{"source": "Play with the round side for a fat tone"}
{"source": " Play with the pointy end for a little better control with only slightly thinner tone"}
{"source": "I purchased this case for my newLine 6 POD HD 500"}
{"source": " It's a well built, solid case for the price"}
{"source": " It fits the HD 500 very snugly and has large pocket on the front for cables"}
{"source": " I wouldn't drop my POD in this thing, but as a basic light duty carrying case it does the job very well"}
{"source": "Not much I can add to the review that isn't well covered already"}
{"source": " It's a nice bag that offers some protection for your equipment"}
{"source": " There are some design flaws that I could see giving some people trouble over time"}
{"source": " But overall it's a great product"}
{"source": "I just wanted to add that it will work for the HD500X with enough room for all the cables/power-supplies needed for effects pod & digital wireless rig"}
{"source": "Wall hangers are good space-saving ideas, but I'm one of those who thinks they can stress necks, depending on the body/neck weight distribution and balance"}
{"source": " I made my own hanging bases - just a carved slab of wood, really - to support the instrument from the bottom"}
{"source": " The top hanger now just serves as a rest, but depending on the guitar's balance I'd recommend a heavy rubber band or something to stretch across the prongs if there's any tendency for the guitar to tilt forward"}
{"source": "Stringed instruments are very difficult to keep accessible and safe at the same time"}
{"source": " These hangers are easy to install, just find a stud behind the sheetrock or any wood to install it on and you are in business"}
{"source": " The stringed instrument becomes  easily accessible and safe"}
{"source": "I bought this one as a way to save space in my overstuffed room"}
{"source": " It looks really good, almost like an ornament"}
{"source": " It sturdy and good quality"}
{"source": " 5 stars"}
{"source": "I have 10 of these hanging on my wall with different types of guitars, banjos, and mandolins"}
{"source": "They attach to the wall with 2 screws"}
{"source": "  Hardware is included to attach those screws to drywall"}
{"source": "  It takes about a 1/4 inch hole in the drywall where a large screw shaped plastic piece is inserted into the drywall and then the regular screws go into the plastic"}
{"source": "The piece that touches the guitar has some sort of silicone/rubber which protects the instrument"}
{"source": "  The holder can be bent in or out a bit to better fit the instrument that you have"}
{"source": "I have moved a couple of times and these can be removed and attached again"}
{"source": "Very sturdy, well made product"}
{"source": "Holds ~8-10 picks depending on thickness"}
{"source": " I stick it on top of my amp so ive always got a pick close by"}
{"source": "I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did, I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick, its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement, I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on"}
{"source": "I might have done something wrong"}
{"source": "I read in a review that these hold six picks"}
{"source": "It held three real well but on the fourth insert the thing just fell apart"}
{"source": "I'll just keep using my pockets"}
{"source": "this product works just fine"}
{"source": "spring loaded"}
{"source": "so load the picks up"}
{"source": "wish they would hold a couple more"}
{"source": "but im happy"}
{"source": "i keep in guitar case  and very handy to have"}
{"source": "enjoy"}
{"source": "This is an OK solution to keeping your picks handy and organized; at least you can have one place where you can find a pick, as opposed to having them scattered all over the house and in every case, but a small baggie will work just as well"}
{"source": " Maybe you have to get to one in a hurry on stage? Sometimes (depending on the amount and size of the pick) it's hard to get the pick out of the holder, and if you use something other than the standard shape, forget it"}
{"source": "  It has an adhesive backing, so I guess you can stick it on your amp/guitar/wall/small animal, but I'd rather not"}
{"source": "This Dunlop \"Ergo Pickholder\" is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar"}
{"source": " This is a great way to always have picks handy, especially if you drop one while playing"}
{"source": " Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick, you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand"}
{"source": " Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid"}
{"source": "RecommendedCFH"}
{"source": "it hold my picks well, but some are to big for it and the tape/foam on the bottom looses the stick quickly"}
{"source": " im neutral on this one"}
{"source": "I own three of these, and have them attached to the back of my headstocks"}
{"source": " Great idea, great concept and great quality"}
{"source": " Only problem is that they do not work with the smaller picks that I have recently adopted"}
{"source": " Dunlop Jazz III, the Dunlop Max-Grip Jazz IIIs and my Dava Jazz picks just won't stay in there without slipping out"}
{"source": "For regular sized picks, it's a perfect product"}
{"source": " For smaller sized picks I improvise by using SD card cases -- perfect fit for jazz picks"}
{"source": "It didn't seem like slight difference in shape would make it almost useless"}
{"source": " It may work well with Dunlop picks but not for thePlanet Waves 10 Standard Guitar Picks - Duralin Blue ###GT!!! Medium/Heavy, also the thicker the pick, the fewer it will hold"}
{"source": " It has sticky back foam tape on it for mounting to a surface like your amp or whatnot"}
{"source": " I've found it mostly not useful thus far, maybe it would help more when playing live so I can grab for a pick and know they will be there"}
{"source": "Very nice, smooth, no sharp edges, not much bigger than the picks it's holding (it holds about 10 of my favorite thin Mel Bay picks) "}
{"source": " the only issue is, the spring clip that pushes the picks to the top, is a little too strong, and was warping my thin picks, but I just put one very stiff pick at the bottom of the pile, and it's fine"}
{"source": "Does what it is designed to do, it holds about 6 picks"}
{"source": "  Small piece of adhesive tape on the back"}
{"source": " The supplier refunded some of the postage"}
{"source": "  Amazon promised to credit my account $10 (credit never appeared) for the highly inflated shipping costs"}
{"source": "  A $2 item cost $17"}
{"source": "70 for shipping!  Be careful and read everything before you click to submit the order"}
{"source": "In my humble opinion, the pictures make the product look purple"}
{"source": "  They're not purple"}
{"source": "  At least the ones I was sent"}
{"source": "  They were charcoal"}
{"source": "I bought them specifically to use with my daughter's purple Washburn guitar, so it's kind of annoying"}
{"source": "Other than the color, there's nothing wrong with them"}
{"source": "this item is light in weight and you can stick it on the side of your guitar to hold many different picks, you will make sure to fine you picks the next time you need them"}
{"source": "Nice, holds picks better then my old one, and best of all"}
{"source": " It comes with one free disintegrating pick! It is really awesome, all you have to do is alt-pick in 16th, and watch it dissapear before your very eyes! Lol, great product though"}
{"source": "I hated having to put the pick between strings"}
{"source": "  And now that I have a ton of picks, I can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar"}
{"source": "  Im still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish, and I dont want to ruin it"}
{"source": "  But the instructions say it should be fine"}
{"source": "  I think I might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well, still deciding on that"}
{"source": "  But for the price you pay for this, it's a no brainer for any musician"}
{"source": "it holds about 6 to 7 picks"}
{"source": "  pressure is just right and overall size is very nice and adequate"}
{"source": "  would recommend"}
{"source": "It's actually sleek looking and although I didn't have the nerve to actually stick this to my guitar, it's a lot easier to find this in my guitar bag or even in my room than a few stray picks here and there"}
{"source": " It holds about 8 medium size picks for me and I'm sure I'll lose a lot less picks because of it! It's almost kind of fun putting my pick in this thing"}
{"source": "is that weird to say? Just buy it already!"}
{"source": "I can't compare this product to any others because this is the only pick holder I use"}
{"source": " I have bought dozens of these over the years and have one on every guitar I own"}
{"source": " And every student I've ever had, has one on their guitar as well"}
{"source": " They are very strong and the adhesive is outstanding"}
{"source": " They stay in place for as long as you want them to and at the same time, they can be easily removed and relocated"}
{"source": " After relocation they are just as sturdy in the next location as they were in the prior location"}
{"source": " I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others"}
{"source": " No matter how many picks you store, or for how long, the spring action loader never loses its resistance"}
{"source": " I highly recommend these"}
{"source": " I personally will never even try any others as I am so pleased with this product"}
{"source": " If you or a student of yours tend to drop a lot of picks, this is the product for you"}
{"source": "Attach one of these to your guitar with the included adhesive strip, and you'll always have a spare pick at the ready"}
{"source": "It is not expensive, but the item is sort of cheap"}
{"source": "  I could have used a baggy to hold my picks"}
{"source": "This is fine as a general stick-on inexpensive pick holder"}
{"source": " It doesn't hold very many picks, but it really doesn't have to"}
{"source": " I would give this five stars except that I really prefer the Planet Waves LED key chain/pick holder over this"}
{"source": " It costs more but has more functional value to me"}
{"source": " If all you need is something very simple, and you have a surface you can stick it on, then this is fine"}
{"source": "A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it"}
{"source": " At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there, but it's never bothered me one bit"}
{"source": " Reaching for pics is never a problem"}
{"source": " I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics"}
{"source": " This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal"}
{"source": "I've come to the point where anytime I buy a new guitar cable it is a planet waves"}
{"source": " They are good quality, decently priced, and I don't have to worry about them shorting out on me"}
{"source": " Definite buy"}
{"source": "I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive, yet lightweight, flexible, and of more than acceptable quality"}
{"source": " The problem with a lot of more expensive cables out there is their greater weight and stiffness, which feels nice at first and feels \"more studio,\" but when you're actually using the cable, it has a tendency to be too heavy and get in the way of things"}
{"source": " For instance, Monster instrument cables have a tendency to move my tuner around because of how heavy they are"}
{"source": "For just a few bucks more, I prefer Pro Co Excellines, since they have metal ends (and their lifetime warranty is simpler, just call Sweetwater), which feels nicer to me, but I like these just fine"}
{"source": "I haven't used the cable yet, but it looks new and durable"}
{"source": " The cable appears to be structurally sound around end connections and seems to be what I expected"}
{"source": " Can't wait for the rest of my gear to get here so I can do a sound test"}
{"source": " Based on physical condition, I would recommend this product"}
{"source": "I was originally was about to purchase a cheaper, thinner cable, but settled on this Planet Waves Classic series XLR cable"}
{"source": " I wanted myMXL 2010 Multi-pattern Studio Micto have a quality xlr cable connecting it"}
{"source": " I also have my microphone and this cable connected to theYamaha Audiogram 6 audio interfaceand it works flawlessly"}
{"source": "* Sturdy cable"}
{"source": " IT is thick and flexible at the same time"}
{"source": " It curls around my microphone stand well, too"}
{"source": "* Good connector heads"}
{"source": " At the female end (microphone), there is spring part that locks in the microphone in"}
{"source": " NIce added peace of mind"}
{"source": "This cable simply feels strong and well made"}
{"source": " Phantom power and data transfer has been flawless"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this quality XLR cable"}
{"source": "Update: 12"}
{"source": "19"}
{"source": "12Still working great after 5 months"}
{"source": " Forgot to mention the nice packaging"}
{"source": " It's eco friendly and nicely packaged"}
{"source": " It also has a lifetime GUARANTEE"}
{"source": " Not a warranty, a guarantee! That speaks volumes on the quality they believe on their product"}
{"source": "What can i say?  this is a xlr cable"}
{"source": "i just have to stress if you want gear that will last for a while and not have a crappy connection somewhere buy decent cables"}
{"source": "This one has quality ends on it and that makes me happy that this investment will last years down the road"}
{"source": "So buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest!"}
{"source": "Happy to have Black connectors on an XLR cable that doesn't cost a ton"}
{"source": "  I use these for a short run to my mixer from my Line 6 Pod"}
{"source": " They work great"}
{"source": " Not the greatest mic cable, but for the price they can't be beat"}
{"source": "I used to think a pick was a pick, with the only difference being stiffness"}
{"source": " (I should say that I prefer picks of medium stiffness)"}
{"source": " The only problems I had with \"regular\" picks was: (1) them slipping in my hand (turning around), (2) out of my hand (on the floor), and, of course, (3) breaking"}
{"source": " I decided to give the Dava picks a try"}
{"source": " I bought a pack of the \"jazz\" picks and a pack of these \"grip tips\""}
{"source": " I really thought I'd like the jazz picks better: that they would be easier to grip and more like a regular pick"}
{"source": " But, after trying them both, I find these (the grip trips) are now my \"pick of choice\""}
{"source": " They fit my grip perfectly, stay put in my hand, and give me maximum control when I play, whether it's lead or rhythm"}
{"source": " I have yet to break one"}
{"source": " I'm mainly buying another set because I've given a few away for people to try and I want to have plenty readily available"}
{"source": " I like to leave picks laying around my house at various optimum locations, so whenever I pick up a guitar to play, I've got one close by (also always keep a spare in my wallet)"}
{"source": " Bottom line is, for me at least, these picks are tops! Sure I can still use a regular pick when that's all that's available"}
{"source": " But why not use the best when I can???Update: Been using these picks for a year since my first review"}
{"source": " Still love them"}
{"source": " Still have yet to break one (and I can be an aggressive strummer)"}
{"source": " The only reason I need to buy more: I lose them"}
{"source": " I have to admit they are a bit pricey, compared to other picks"}
{"source": " But for me, they are still tops"}
{"source": " Which is why I'm buying another half dozen"}
{"source": "Dava picks are one of life's guilty little pleasures"}
{"source": " They may seem pricey for picks, but they're still not that expensive"}
{"source": " I bought this batch of picks when I realized my Davas from three years back were all gone"}
{"source": "I use these to play slide"}
{"source": " I also have Fender and Musician's Friend picks, but those are just the standard flat stamped-out pieces of plastic"}
{"source": " The Davas offer a much better grip and a greater sense of control"}
{"source": " And they just plain feel good to use"}
{"source": " The other picks have more of a tendency to slip and slide, but with Dava you get a great grip"}
{"source": "I have been playing guitar off/on for about 30 years"}
{"source": " I have always used whatever cheap picks I could find laying around or snagged from music shops -- the free ones they give you when you try out a guitar in the shop :) Always Medium gauge, for both acoustic and electric"}
{"source": " I decided to try these Dava 1303's because they were cheap and looked cool, wasn't expecting much, I mean, a pick is a pick, right? Wrong"}
{"source": " These little guys have a fantastic \"feel\" to them; they seem to get in between the strings so effortlessly for flat picking"}
{"source": " It's crazy but that is what I am experiencing"}
{"source": " They are maybe a bit on the thin side, but not overly so, I got used to them quick"}
{"source": " Plenty stiff enough for enthusiastic strumming or picking"}
{"source": " Tone-wise, they produce a nice, crisp, slightly metallic string sound which I rather like"}
{"source": " I recorded some with them today and it was perhaps a bit on the loud side with regards to the audible pick attack on the strings on the acoustic (a Breedlove C25)"}
{"source": " But not bad and I was using a sensitive Rode condenser"}
{"source": " Haven't played much with them on my electric yet (customized Fender Stratocaster) but I'm sure they will be fine there as well"}
{"source": " I like these picks a LOT and am ordering a dozen more to keep around"}
{"source": " Good stuff"}
{"source": "I usually use Dunlop big stubby 2"}
{"source": "0 picks"}
{"source": " I used the Master Control Pick for the first time today, and I just had to order two more, because they're so amazing!! The attack is second to none!! At first the pick felt a bit strange as I'm accustomed to the thicker Dunlop, and I have to admit that initially I was a bit weary of the notably thinner Dava; but in no way has my playing been hindered, if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly, and by far these are the most comfortable picks I've ever used!! What a find!!UPDATE 6/6/14:Still the best pick I've ever played"}
{"source": " If you're worried about the metal tip of the pick breaking or weakening the strings, don't worry, they won't (at least not from what I've seen)"}
{"source": " Also, pinch harmonics are the easiest thing in the world to play with these picks!"}
{"source": "Don't let the term &#34;nylon&#34; fool you"}
{"source": " This is a really nice, thick strap"}
{"source": " Nothing like those $5 cheap straps"}
{"source": " A great value and it matches my guitar that has a cool retro 50's pinstripe flame paintjob"}
{"source": "Reduces string noise as promised"}
{"source": "  Makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise"}
{"source": "  I think they also do reduce some finger soreness as your fingers aren't as irritated from sliding on bare strings"}
{"source": "  Makes them feel kinda like elixirs, but sounds a lot better and you still have the naked strings feel"}
{"source": "  Also does make the neck a lot smoother"}
{"source": "  I will be buying more for all my guitar cases"}
{"source": "I was hoping this product would eliminate string \"talking\" and had mixed results"}
{"source": "  It helped some but didn't get rid of the noise entirely"}
{"source": "  It also makes the strings feel nice as well"}
{"source": "  I will continue to use it"}
{"source": "I've been using Finger Ease for years and always will on my acoustic and electric guitars"}
{"source": " It has multiple uses:-Cleans off residual oils and buildup from your hands, extending the life and tone of your strings-Lubricates strings and neck for faster and smoother playability, though this effect does typically wear off after an hour or so-Works decently well as a polishing agent to rub off finger prints, etc"}
{"source": " from the top, sides, and back, will not harm most finishes (as far as I know)I usually just apply it before playing but using it after could definitely be beneficial as well"}
{"source": "I did read that the compound is conductive and should be kept off of your pickups to avoid interference"}
{"source": " I'm not sure if this is true as I've never noticed any problem when the spray gets on my humbuckers"}
{"source": " However, I typically try to keep it off of electronic  components in general just out of common sense"}
{"source": "For under ten bucks, the can will last you awhile"}
{"source": "  Just order a few at a time and find free shipping, you'll find yourself wanting one in each guitar case all the time"}
{"source": "I needed something so I would not have to drill a hole in my guitar to attach my strap"}
{"source": "This is nicer than using a shoelace to attach the strap and it is an EASY, QUICK release and is very secure"}
{"source": " I am happy with this product and will order some more in the future"}
{"source": " Nice, inexpensive and useful solution to a guitar strap problem!"}
{"source": "Works as advertised"}
{"source": "  I was a bit skeptical when the product arrived, but I just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work"}
{"source": "  Pretty simple, even if you're \"technically challenged"}
{"source": "\"  Easy to use"}
{"source": "  Haven't gigged with it yet, but I can imagine that this strap \"isn't going anywhere,\" regarding its functionality"}
{"source": "  Not a \"pretty\" product, but good stuff"}
{"source": "I just put it on my Baby Taylor guitar strap"}
{"source": "  Nice!  Does the job and does it well"}
{"source": "  Comes in a \"guitar shaped\" package that clearly shows how to install it in seconds if you are a newbie"}
{"source": "  Glad I got this one"}
{"source": "  It is exactly what I was hoping it would be"}
{"source": "I was wandering how to make easy do quick release strap from my guitar"}
{"source": " I did see this device on amazon"}
{"source": "com and I decide to buy and try one"}
{"source": " I was pleasantly surprised with this \"Guitar Quick Release System\" is working good with my acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " And because of that I did purchase 2 more for my other guitar and for my friend one"}
{"source": "I've been using these on my acoustic guitars (and straps) for over a decade"}
{"source": "  They're sturdy and convenient, and so much more attractive than adding a shoelace to your strap"}
{"source": "  The ability to quickly disconnect the strap for storage (or when you don't need the strap hanging from your guitar, e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": ", sitting in a chair) works exactly as advertised"}
{"source": "  I've purchased several of these and can't say enough good things about the product and company!"}
{"source": "Simple enough, right? Works as advertised"}
{"source": " A great simple idea that I'm glad someone put into production"}
{"source": " For my taste, the loop is too long where it wraps around at the headstock/nut area, so I just tied it up snug"}
{"source": " I had been using the Martin leather strap holder where your strap hooks onto a plastic button, and this is far more secure because straps sometimes work their way off of the button on the Martin holder"}
{"source": " However, folks with brand new shiny expensive guitars might want to take note: while the nylon lace that wraps around is nice and strong, it is fairly rough and abrasive, and my experience is that it will very definitely wear at the finish of your git in that area"}
{"source": " Won't rub the finish off or anything to that degree, but if you're freaky squeaky clean about maintaining cosmetic perfection on your guitar (which I am NOT), you will definitely notice the finish rubbed and dulled and even chipped a bit there at points of contact"}
{"source": " I can think of a million simple solutions to that, but that's another story"}
{"source": " Overall, great little item"}
{"source": "I bought it by mistake cause I don't own nor play the bass but it works for my guitar"}
{"source": "fits well!! good quality too!"}
{"source": "I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists"}
{"source": " I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect"}
{"source": " These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics"}
{"source": " They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable"}
{"source": " It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description"}
{"source": " I wasted my money"}
{"source": " Don't waste yours"}
{"source": " Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)"}
{"source": "Nice looking gooseneck, threads are clean, fits well"}
{"source": "  However, the gooseneck is too flexible and will not hold up a mic (Shure SM58) without collapsing"}
{"source": "  Better try another brand, or spend a buck or two more to get a better product"}
{"source": "Absolutely Obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock--1970's influences"}
{"source": "  I would probably buy the Phase 100 today though, as it has 4 different positions to choose from, I assume including the original set-up as one of them"}
{"source": "Well, I need to correct this"}
{"source": "  This review was for the OLD models"}
{"source": "  The NEW models have FAR too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified"}
{"source": "  I thought I was replacing an old model with the NEW one, but alas the NEW is not worthy of a place in my effects chain!I will probably get an EH Small stone now, though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too"}
{"source": "  Sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non-musical business men who care ONLY about the bottom line and NOT enough, if AT ALL about the sound/quality of their products"}
{"source": "  The capitalists have become too greedy, and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live"}
{"source": "  God help us!"}
{"source": "I have several MXR pedals"}
{"source": " Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-\"script\" version reviewed here)"}
{"source": " This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt"}
{"source": " I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications"}
{"source": " (Look up \"MXR Phase 90 Mods,\" and \"Erik's Corner\" will show you how"}
{"source": ") I made the \"R28,\" \"C11,\" and \"C12\" modifications"}
{"source": " The result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion"}
{"source": " Finally, I tried adjusting the internal trim pot"}
{"source": " On no setting could I get rid of "}
{"source": " you guessed it: distortion"}
{"source": " I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable"}
{"source": " No luck"}
{"source": " BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION, AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90"}
{"source": "The MXR Phase 90 is a classic stompbox popularized by Eddie Van Halen"}
{"source": " At present, I own an MXR Phase 90, a Boss PH-3 Phase Shifter, and a Line 6 MM4 Modulations Modeler (with a few phaser patches), so I can compare these three units"}
{"source": "The Phase 90 has a single \"Speed\" control that sets the rate of the phase, so it is simple to use"}
{"source": " If there is a single knob, that is a good indicator that the manufacturer feels pretty good about the sound of the unit"}
{"source": " In this case, I agree"}
{"source": "The MXR Phase 90 is by far the cheapest of these three units"}
{"source": " In my opinion, it also gives the best sound within its capabilities, and actually seems to boost the volume slightly"}
{"source": " The Boss PH-3 gets a slight volume drop but it is workable, and the Line 6 MM4 has a volume drop that for me is hard to use on a guitar pedalboard because I usually don't leave modulations on for an entire song, but turn them on/off in different sections (unless its a chorus)"}
{"source": "Of the three, the Phase 90 has the least versatility"}
{"source": " You can imitate the Phase 90 sound on both of the other units (the Line 6 MM4 does a slightly better job) and both the PH-3 and MM4 have more sonic possibilities"}
{"source": " Also, the Boss PH-3 will give a lot more spacey extremes than the Phase 90 which stays in a \"normal\" range"}
{"source": " But again, of the three the MXR Phase 90 sounds the best of the three at what it can do"}
{"source": "Bottom Line:(1) A classic pedal at a great price(2) Great sound & slight volume boost(3) Simple to use(4) Limited sonic possibility, \"safe\" or \"normal\" guitar sounds (no crazy extremes)(5) Beautiful bright orange color, you can't miss it(6) Compact size does not eat up pedalboard space"}
{"source": "Nice to keep your mic nice and fresh"}
{"source": " Plus it protects the head and gets rid of most of the noise while taking a breath"}
{"source": " Decent value!"}
{"source": "Okay,  Color coding is a GREAT idea"}
{"source": "Divas will not use the red ball windscreen"}
{"source": "Why?Because, from a distance it looks like they have a clown nose"}
{"source": "No kidding!  I have had several tell this to me and my sound tech"}
{"source": "  So save your dough, buy any color but RED"}
{"source": "Diva's!!!!  What can I say?"}
{"source": "the foam ball prevents wind pop and it also doesn't get smelly like some other foam would be"}
{"source": " i would highly recommend it"}
{"source": "I use this for my rockband microphones but be careful , if you have cats the hair will get stuck in it"}
{"source": " Other than that it really works well in taking away some of the echo from loud speakers while playing rockband"}
{"source": "Use it with an SM58 Shure mic in a studio type application"}
{"source": " Holds up great, Mic does not slip"}
{"source": " Upside down, sideways"}
{"source": "it does what's it's suppose to do"}
{"source": " holds a mic, pretty much what you see is what you get"}
{"source": " works very well"}
{"source": "This is a simple, straight forward and worthy replacement mic clip for the standard Shure SM57/58 type mic"}
{"source": " Well made, reasonably priced as with most On Stage stuff"}
{"source": "These are obviously designed for microphones with the Shure SM-57/58 series form factor"}
{"source": " I use mine for the much heavierBlue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone, and this clip holds it right where I adjust it to"}
{"source": "The threads in the base of the clip appear to be precision-machined"}
{"source": " Mine effortlessly mate with anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Black, anOn Stage Stands 7701B Tripod Boom Microphone Standand aMusician's Gear Die-Cast Mic Stand Black, which are the only stands with which I've used this clip"}
{"source": "Bear in mind that if you are using microphones that are designed with form factors that are different from the Shure SM (and PG and similar), or a different brand that uses that form factor, then this clip will probably not work"}
{"source": " Also I cannot vouch for it as a clip for heavy touring, although for local bar gigs it should easily hold up, and at the price you can afford to purchase some spares (actually, you SHOULD do that"}
{"source": ")I am personally pleased with mine and do not regret selecting this model"}
{"source": " I have five or six on hand, including a few spares, and if I needed more clips, this is the one I would purchase"}
{"source": "good deal"}
{"source": " quite the steal"}
{"source": " if it sounds at all like the pinstripe bass pedal"}
{"source": " im sure it will be amazing"}
{"source": " and its cool that i got a snare head with the deal"}
{"source": " those are pretty crucial to a drumset"}
{"source": " :)"}
{"source": "I bought these heads almost a year ago and after countless band practices and gigs, the same heads I bought over a year ago are still sounding great and haven't torn"}
{"source": " these heads are amazing and a very good investment"}
{"source": " make your kit sound very professional and I just love em to death"}
{"source": " definitely recommend these heads to people looking for new heads"}
{"source": "These heads are virtually indestructable and produce a great sound"}
{"source": " Attack is superb, especially when played hard and loud, and the construction ensures minimal ring and overtone"}
{"source": "Be aware that this head pack does not product the best tone and sound for jazz (get Remo Fiberskyns for that kind of sound), but the Pinstripe model that comprises this pack has become the De Facto standard for rock"}
{"source": "If you still have the heads that come with your drum kit - and play rock - changing over to this pack will probably make a dramatic improvement in the way your kit sounds, regardless of whether you are playing a budget no-name brand, or Pearl, Mapex, Tama, Ludwig or similar pro quality drums"}
{"source": "I also recommend that you get a Rhythm Tech Memo Key (ASIN B0002E2EOE) or Evans Torque tuning key (ASIN B0002D0HZI) to allow you to quickly get your heads in perfect tuning once you have them installed"}
{"source": "  Either of these will allow you to get the most out of these (or any other) heads and transform your kit into a finely tuned, professional sounding set of instruments"}
{"source": "yes you can tweak it so its less, but cant even use it for recording with or without an amp so much hiss its unusable"}
{"source": "I'll keep it short: I owned a Boss EQ pedal in the past and didn't have much luck with it"}
{"source": " I tried and tried and tried to hone in the sound I was looking for but the Boss just wouldn't do it for me"}
{"source": " Fast forward a few years and I purchase this little baby on a whim"}
{"source": "  Man, am I glad I did!  The 6 sliders made it very easy to dial in the exact tone I was looking for"}
{"source": "  A small boost of the first two sliders gave my amp more bottom-end than it could ever manage on its own, and a small boost of the last two provided more of a balanced, well-rounded sound"}
{"source": "  Love it and wouldn't wanna part with it!The pedal itself is built like a rock"}
{"source": "  I imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing"}
{"source": "  The individual sliders, although not quite as Ford-tough as the rest of the pedal (haha), feel nice and slide easy"}
{"source": "  Each slider lights up red when engaged, which not only looks cool but makes it very easy to see on a dimly lit stage"}
{"source": "If you're on the fence about an EQ or which EQ brand to buy, I recommend you give this little monster a stomp"}
{"source": "Bought this on a whim"}
{"source": "  It works well when utilized with the amp in direct fashion"}
{"source": "  When used with a pedalboard rig, it doesn't add much except for hiss, unfortunately"}
{"source": "  Sweet sound with an older Fender amp unit, though"}
{"source": "  Does not sound good with updated equipment, Line 6 equipment, Roland units"}
{"source": "  I'd say definitely do not get this if you're a tech or gear head"}
{"source": "  Get it if you're a simple player with few FX in your arsenal"}
{"source": "  It does sound good when just utilized with amp and guitar, amp, wah, and guitar, or amp, wah, guitar, and expression pedal"}
{"source": "  Nothing else I've tied it to has seemed to work out, though"}
{"source": "  Probably a wasted product with where I'm headed as a technical player, but good for beginners and intermediate levels"}
{"source": "  Into King Crimson/Fripp styles?  Don't go for this for modeling"}
{"source": "I didn't want to spend too much $$ for a guitar that I wasn't sure if I would like it or not"}
{"source": " There were a few at the local music store but 3 times the price"}
{"source": " They were good quality and if this didn't work out then I would have probably gone that route"}
{"source": " To my surprise, this guitar exceeds all my expectations for an acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " The only downfall was that the frets were sharp on the one side of the guitar"}
{"source": " The local shop only charged me $5 to shave them down"}
{"source": " I replaced the strings right away"}
{"source": " I'm completely satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it"}
{"source": " Definitely worth the price you pay"}
{"source": "This was my first acoustic guitar, and I've received some surprised looks about its tone and play-ability -- both from from my luthier (who used to be a tech at Martin) to a couple pro players with 30-40+ years respectively under their belts"}
{"source": " It's light, comfortable, well made, has a fast neck, and is just marvelous in every way for a beginner like myself"}
{"source": " Wonderfully priced"}
{"source": " I was expecting to be disappointed, but didn't want to invest in a new hobby until I was sure I'd stick with it"}
{"source": "It's possible that I just lucked out with a good one"}
{"source": " After a year of playing my Jasmine, I have no urge to upgrade to anything else"}
{"source": " Will confess that I'd like a 12-string, but that's another animal"}
{"source": "I am too new and inexperienced with acoustics to be able to really define the sonic quality of this guitar compared to more expensive models (I'm more of an electric guy), but for me in my ignorant state, it's 5 stars without hesitation"}
{"source": "I did need to have it set up, however, and the stock strings on mine were in poor condition"}
{"source": " Don't recall if I purchased it on Amazon"}
{"source": " In any event, a $30-$50 trip to the luthier with new strings, and it felt like a guitar far in excess of $100"}
{"source": " It has stayed in tune quite nicely, and I often change tunings (standard, mostly Eb, occasional full step down, Open D, G and others)"}
{"source": "No fret buzz, and I just love the feel of the neck"}
{"source": " I do wish the body was a tad thinner as I have shoulder problems, but I'm sure a thinner body or shallow bowl would sacrifice bass and richness"}
{"source": " Nice and light, however, and perfect for carrying on your back"}
{"source": "By the way, I have the model with the black pickguard -- the one pictured looks similar in every other way"}
{"source": " Quite sure it's the same model"}
{"source": "It is taking a chance on ordering a guitar online!I took the chance and got what most of the reviews already shared"}
{"source": "Here's my take-PROS:- Cheap! $90 is very inexpensive for a guitar!- Well packaged for shipping- Arrived 1 day early- Fair quality"}
{"source": " This is not a top of the line or even middle of the line guitar"}
{"source": " It is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship, but not stellar"}
{"source": "- Good sound! This does have a very good sound- with new strings of course- Size: This is not a full size guitar, but larger than a 3/4"}
{"source": " It is a \"concert\" size which I like!- It is a cut-away design without electronics! This combo is very rare!- Fair to good wood materials and furniture- Good design! This guitar sounds good, feels good, looks very good"}
{"source": "- Matte finish: this comes with a matte finish, not shiny- I like thatCONS:- Strings- corroded poor quality strings- neck condition: Neck has slight bend, I needed to adjust the truss and file a few frets"}
{"source": " There is still a slight dip and bump at the 12th fret causing fret buzz"}
{"source": "- frets are not smoothed on ends- neck surface is not sanded well but smooth enoughI like this guitar"}
{"source": " It's very inexpensive, needs a little work, sounds very good"}
{"source": " I hope this information help you make an informed choice about a guitar purchase"}
{"source": "I've played the guitar for a number of years, some of them professionally, and during that time I've owned guitars by Fender, Gibson, Ovation, B"}
{"source": "C"}
{"source": " Rich, Yamaha and Applause"}
{"source": " That said, admittedly, this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap, expendable guitar that was reasonably playable, that I could take with me when I go camping"}
{"source": " While my expectations weren't all that high due to guitar's price, upon reading other reviews and having experienced Takamine's quality, I decided to gave this Jasmine a try"}
{"source": "  I'm glad I did - what a nice guitar it turned out to be! Out of the box, the fit and matte finish were impressive"}
{"source": " The neck action was nicely set up, the intonation is spot-on and the guitar has a rich sound and tone"}
{"source": "  The tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely"}
{"source": "  Note that I changed strings from the set provided to a set of extra-light gauge strings just as a personal preference and that the guitar features a black pick guard not shown in some product photos"}
{"source": " The Jasmine S34C NEX is truly an impressive guitar for the price"}
{"source": "I have played the guitar for nearly 50 years now, and wanted an inexpensive small-body steel-string guitar to keep out for informal practice and noodling"}
{"source": " This one fills the bill pretty well"}
{"source": " Build quality is quite good (made in Indonesia, not China as I had expected), and the intonation is perfect"}
{"source": " The finish has a hard matte surface that will probably wear well"}
{"source": " A pick guard is present, but when I removed the plastic shipping protector, the entire guard came up with it"}
{"source": " The adhesive residue comes right off, so I will play the guitar without a pickguard"}
{"source": " Bracing is light -- the entire guitar is light"}
{"source": " The body is a bit larger in the lower bout than I expected, but it sits on the lap more comfortably than a dreadnought"}
{"source": "I take issue with some reviewers' suggestions that this would be a good beginner guitar right out of the box"}
{"source": " The string spacing at the nut is narrower than it should be for the width of the neck, cramping the fingers"}
{"source": " The nut should be replaced with one that spaces the strings across the fingerboard just a little more"}
{"source": " The action may be lowered by shaving the bridge saddle very carefully, and just a little at a time"}
{"source": " This work will cost as much as the guitar cost if you take it to a luthier, but if you can do it yourself, will improve the playability of the instrument"}
{"source": "The strings supplied on the guitar were tinny and cheap, so I replaced them with a set of D'Addario EJ-16 Light Phosphor-Bronze"}
{"source": " The improvement in tone was immediate -- this little guitar sounds pretty darn good"}
{"source": " All in all, with some careful modification, this is a good guitar for the beginner or casual player, and a very acceptable one for the experienced guitarist who can do a little modification him/herself"}
{"source": "I hadn't played guitar in a number of years and decided to get back into it"}
{"source": " Having had carpal tunnel surgery a few months ago, and having small hands to begin with, I started researching guitars with narrow necks"}
{"source": " The Jasmine by Takamine kept coming up and had really good reviews, so I decided to give it a try, buying the S34C"}
{"source": " Firstly, it was delivered promptly as requested, and arrived in pristine condition, with some really nice strings"}
{"source": " It has a lovely honey gold finish on the front of the body, which had attracted me to the guitar in the first place"}
{"source": " I really appreciate the cutaway"}
{"source": " How many high notes will I be hitting on this baby? Who knows, but it looks WAY cool, LOL! The craftsmanship, at least to my unpracticed eyes, looks superb"}
{"source": " I wasn't too crazy about the pickguard with all the lettering on it, but finally figured out the lettering was just a sticker that could be easily removed"}
{"source": " And the sound"}
{"source": "just lovely, with that ringing tonality one would expect from a steel string guitar, but with some lovely mellow tones where needed as well"}
{"source": " I am so jazzed about how wonderful this guitar is, I'm taking online video lessons and learning a storm of chords and fingering techniques! Hey, I don't expect to be a Leo Kottke or Martin Simpson anytime soon, but I've got something to shoot for, and we all need a dream! If you're looking for a great guitar at a very reasonable price, look no further"}
{"source": " Oh, the reason why I only gave it four stars is cuz the neck really doesn't seem to be all that narrow after all"}
{"source": " But, maybe it's just my small kid-like hands"}
{"source": " Thumb to little finger, I can barely reach an octave on piano"}
{"source": " And there ya go!"}
{"source": "I don't own one, but have been playing my sister-in-law's for the last year when visiting"}
{"source": " Didn't know much about the guitar, but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship"}
{"source": " Changed the strings, and, other than the action being a little high, it's as good as anything I've played for under $500"}
{"source": " I honestly thought it cost around $350, so I was quite surprised seeing it for sale for less than $100"}
{"source": " It's definitely a great value"}
{"source": "In part because of my experience with this guitar, I purchased a Takamine G Series 12-string last year, (for considerably more money), and it's simply incredible"}
{"source": "Bought a Takamine 40 years ago"}
{"source": " It was an exceptional guitar for which I paid $125"}
{"source": " Adjusted for inflation, that would be $800 when I bought this Jasmine"}
{"source": "I got a superb machine for the money"}
{"source": " Simply superb"}
{"source": "  It's not my old Takamine, but the negative differences are slight, and there are only two of them three days into my acquaintance with this guitar"}
{"source": "The first is that the finish is not as good"}
{"source": " The sanding between coats was skimped, which means that the finish on the front has some texture; the sides of the guitar are also a bit rough"}
{"source": "The second probably flows from the first"}
{"source": "  The tone is a touch wooden; it doesn't sing as the old Taka did"}
{"source": "Positives: the intonation is true at the twelfth fret, and it is playable (and enjoyable to play) with a slide"}
{"source": " After the first tune-up of the strings, it stayed in tune"}
{"source": "For its price, this guitar is a superb introduction to playing"}
{"source": "A very young child, or a small woman, will find this guitar a bit large and deep for true playing comfort"}
{"source": " For everyone else, it should fit pretty comfortably"}
{"source": "The intonation is true at the twelfth fret, and it is playable (and enjoyable to play) with a slide"}
{"source": " After the first tune-up of the strings, it stayed in tune"}
{"source": "Any beginner, and more than a few cost-sensitive intermediate players, will be pleased with this guitar"}
{"source": "It's kind of pointless to add yet another review to an item that has already received hundreds of (mostly) positive reviews already"}
{"source": " But I can't help it - I like this guitar"}
{"source": " Quite simply, this is a really nice guitar"}
{"source": " Is it $750 nice? No"}
{"source": " But for less than $100, nice doesn't even describe it"}
{"source": "My Jasmine arrived well packaged including double boxing"}
{"source": "  The outside box had a little damage, but the guitar was well protected inside, so no problem"}
{"source": "Since I'd read a few reviews commenting on flaws in the finish, one of the first things I did was check it out thoroughly"}
{"source": " Nope, no flaws noticeable to me"}
{"source": "  Kind of a satin \"laid back\" finish that feels good and looks nice"}
{"source": "  Oh, but I did immediately remove the pick guard"}
{"source": "  It just peeled off without damaging the finish underneath and (in my opinion) it looks better without it"}
{"source": "Other reviews had complained about a too-low action"}
{"source": " But mine seems dead on"}
{"source": "  Of course action height is more a personal preference than any hard and fast rule"}
{"source": " But even so, there's really no way anyone could characterize mine as too low"}
{"source": "Some mentioned rusty strings"}
{"source": "  Not on mine"}
{"source": " The strings looked fine, and after the usual breaking in period have maintained tune very well"}
{"source": "And of course the guitar sounds good"}
{"source": "  Again, maybe not $750 good, but at least $250-300 good"}
{"source": " And certainly better than I expected it to sound at that price"}
{"source": "So, if you want a nice sounding, decent looking, inexpensive guitar - you've found it"}
{"source": "  Stop wasting time"}
{"source": " Just click the buy it button"}
{"source": "I bought my son a thousand dollar Epiphone limited edition electric guitar for his birthday just a few months ago, so when he told me he would like an acoustic guitar for Christmas, I told him an expensive one was not in our budget"}
{"source": "We went to the local music store and tried out several models but he kept coming back to this one"}
{"source": " The sound was absolutely fabulous, much better than his current acoustic guitar that cost more than twice as much as this one"}
{"source": "The store manager told us that for the price this guitar cannot be beat and that he bought one for his son as well"}
{"source": " In my opinion, this was as good as other brands costing three times as much"}
{"source": " I'm not sure how Takamine is making these quality guitars for so little money, but if you're looking for a starter guitar, or just looking to add another guitar to your collection, this would make an excellent choice"}
{"source": "I inspected the guitar we took home and found a few places where the finish was not quite as smooth as the rest of the guitar, but overall the quality and sound cannot be beat for this price"}
{"source": "We also went with this cutaway version so my son can have easier access to the higher frets vs"}

{"source": "I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents"}
{"source": "  Besides the risk to my guitar, there is the cost"}
{"source": "  For the price I paid for this guitar, I will be money ahead in two visits to my parents"}
{"source": "  I had it shipped to my parents when I bought it, and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits"}
{"source": "  It has much better tone than I expected, and very good action"}
{"source": "  Stays in tune very well"}
{"source": "  I am very happy with my purchase"}
{"source": "  Recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party"}
{"source": "I was thrilled when my guitar arrived and even more so after I tuned it and began to play"}
{"source": "My guitar is absolutely beautiful"}
{"source": " The finish is flawless"}
{"source": " And it's got that new guitar smell"}
{"source": "ahhhhhh"}
{"source": "It does have a pick guard (that is not shown in the photo on any website or in any catalog) which pleases me"}
{"source": " It would be a shame to scratch the surface while strumming with a heavier pick"}
{"source": " I read one review on a music vendor's website where the reviewer complained about Takamine and Jasmine printed all over the pick guard"}
{"source": " And they were right about that"}
{"source": "but I found it very easy to remove all these words by simply peeling off this protective sticker"}
{"source": " Dah"}
{"source": "The strings are a little heavier than I like but I'll be changing them in a few weeks anyway"}
{"source": "The sound and craftsmanship is anything but what you would expect from such an affordable guitar and everything you'd expect to pay more for"}
{"source": " It has a rich, full bodied sound"}
{"source": "I am now a diehard Takamine fan"}
{"source": "well"}
{"source": " First of all, I am a beginner"}
{"source": " I do not know anything about guitar"}
{"source": " I saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets"}
{"source": " Mine came yesterday and I am afraid that it would have issue, so I brought it to school and let my professor checked for me"}
{"source": " It surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all"}
{"source": " The string does not corroded, but I changed mine anyway"}
{"source": " The fret does not have any issue at all"}
{"source": " and the Truss rod adjustment is perfect"}
{"source": " The action is low and the guitar structure is perfect"}
{"source": " When my professor starts playing it, he was surprised by the sound it produced"}
{"source": " He thought the guitar cost $300 above!!"}
{"source": " He also bought one this morning"}
{"source": "haha"}
{"source": "anyways, I buy it from amazon and the packaging is great!!"}
{"source": "My guitar comes in a perfect condition, and I strongly recommended this guitar for anybody!!"}
{"source": "Right out of the box this guitar was flawless"}
{"source": " I played it with the strings it came with (to inspect intonation-fret buzz etc"}
{"source": " the old strings would work for set-up if needed) and the intonation (harmonics at the 12 fret exactly matched the fretted note at the 12th fret) was dead on"}
{"source": " Absolutely no fret buzz even at the 21st fret"}
{"source": " I have been playing guitar for 40 years and I have seen my fair share of acoustic guitars in that time"}
{"source": " To say this is a beautiful playing and sounding instrument just doesn't do it justice"}
{"source": " I have played many expensive acoustic guitars that didn't sound or play as well as this even after set-up"}
{"source": " The lows are nice and clear and the highs are clear without sounding \"tinny\" or banjo like"}
{"source": " A very well built, great sounding guitar"}
{"source": " For the price you can't go wrong"}
{"source": " I would recommend this guitar to novices and pros"}
{"source": " I was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price"}
{"source": " 100% satisfied"}
{"source": " Rock on Jasmine!!"}
{"source": "Lets be honest, it must be pretty hard to mess up a cleaning cloth"}
{"source": " It either cleans or it doesn't"}
{"source": " This cleans/polishes all of my guitars great"}
{"source": " Just make sure the strings are off so that this doesn't get caught on them"}
{"source": " This is a brand I've come to trust"}
{"source": "Scratch free, durable, machine washable"}
{"source": " I use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much, much longer"}
{"source": " You place the cloth next to a string, then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces, sides and top of the string, then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times, then repeat on the remaining strings"}
{"source": " I then slip it under the strings and sort of buff the fingerboard, then wipe down the surface of the guitar and tuning keys"}
{"source": " Takes a matter of moments and works great"}
{"source": " Then once every week or two, it just goes in with the laundry, comes out perfectly clean again"}
{"source": "Polyester microfiber is kind of an unusual fabric"}
{"source": " It is fully synthetic and water will bead up on the surface, but it works well for polishing"}
{"source": " If I'm using carnuba wax, I use a 100% cotton towel to remove it, but for dry polishing wouldn't be without one for each guitar"}
{"source": "This is my first attempt at buying a polishing cloth for my guitars"}
{"source": " I tried this untreated 'MicrofiberPolish Cloth' on my Gibson ES-339 because I had heard good things about it"}
{"source": "We'll begin with some stats: the cloth is 11-3/4\" by 11-3/4\" and has an 1/8\" border stitched aroundthe edge"}
{"source": " It feels very soft to the touch and it is made in Korea"}
{"source": " There is a small warning on theback of the package that states: \"Not designed for cleaning electrical devices"}
{"source": "\" You can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water, rinse it out and hang it up to dry"}
{"source": " Now to thereview"}
{"source": "My guitar has an Ebony hard lacquer finish, meaning very glossy and shiny"}
{"source": " I have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body's front and back and BACKof the neck"}
{"source": " I was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off"}
{"source": " When going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish"}
{"source": "What I discovered about this cloth, even with increased elbow grease, is that it has it's limitations"}
{"source": "So, if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out"}
{"source": " If the body oils have been there for awhile, probably collecting dust, then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument"}
{"source": " Pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument"}
{"source": " Do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument"}
{"source": " You should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it"}
{"source": "I decided to use Dunlop's 'Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish & Cleaner' to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges"}
{"source": " I used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely"}
{"source": " Since then I have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the 'Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth'"}
{"source": " It doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid"}
{"source": " I also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind"}
{"source": "You want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish"}
{"source": "The fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play"}
{"source": " I would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated  on the fret board will get into the Microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar"}
{"source": "So like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything"}
{"source": " I gave this untreated microfiber cloth4 stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean  and polished with minimal effort"}
{"source": " My highexpectations, based upon the blurb, were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around"}
{"source": " It was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess"}
{"source": "Nonetheless, I like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime"}
{"source": " I will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time I am done playing"}
{"source": "Purchased this after owning a ernie ball polish cloth that was given to me"}
{"source": " This cloth cleans up pretty well, but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook"}
{"source": " I dunno if they weren't meant to wipe the strings with but my ernie ball cloth is A LOT more durable than this cloth"}
{"source": " They do the job but i believe that the ernie ball cloth does it better"}
{"source": " Like a previous reviewer, i'm a little iffy about putting this cloth in the washer"}
{"source": "Update: Putting it in the watcher was fine and idk why but after washing it for the first time it cleans up 1000000x better than before, i like this and my ernie ball cloth :)From 3 to 5 starts!!"}
{"source": "Sorry, but I'm not as smitten with this cloth as some of the other reviewers"}
{"source": " It's okay; good size, works pretty well, but sheds when new"}
{"source": " And despite claims of being laundry-safe, the edges began to unravel after the first wash"}
{"source": " I used with Planet Waves Restore polish and got good results, but probably would not buy again"}
{"source": "I bought my first one from Amazon over a month ago - and simply fell in love with it"}
{"source": "  It cleans/polishes wood, metal (although for strings, I use GHS' Fast Fret), eye-glasses, computer screens, etc with wonderful ability, easily replacing \"casual\" cleaning/polishing fluids"}
{"source": "  I even recently bought a 2nd just because"}
{"source": "  And yes, the first one has finally gone through the wash after a month of constant use- I knew it was time when it wasn't wiping off the smudges as quickly"}
{"source": "  It came out with a slightly nappy texture (to be expected really), but still works as well as ever"}
{"source": "  There is a vast amount of different \"polish\" cloth brands out there, but you won't go wrong with this one"}
{"source": "I really did not expect much from this rag"}
{"source": " I just wanted a good quality lint-free / scratch-free cloth to clean my stringed instruments before and after each use"}
{"source": " I was totally surprised that it actually works this good"}
{"source": " Removes all the crap on your shiny finish without having to spend time constantly cleaning with guitar cleaner"}
{"source": " This will probably help protect your finish over the long run too"}
{"source": "You may wonder how you can get excited just over a cheap little cleaning rag"}
{"source": " This thing rocks! It picks up every smudge, smear, & print and leaves nothing behind"}
{"source": " It's an amazing little cleaning tool, and I WILL replace it if/when it ever wears out"}
{"source": " If you are like me, and you want your instruments to look clean & grunge-free onstage, you should check out this little wonder"}
{"source": " You can just keep it in your pocket and wipe it once between songs if you want"}
{"source": " Doesn't get any easier"}
{"source": " Great product!**********************A note about the mixed reviews"}
{"source": " I REALLY wish Amazon would separate the 3 different cloths instead of lumping them into one product page"}
{"source": " It really isn't fair to the actual good product to have it's rating artificially lowered by bad reviews for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM"}
{"source": " It also causes confusion to potential buyers because they have to sift through every review to find the ones that apply to the actual product they want"}
{"source": " When I go to the product page for the AMAZINGLY GOOD micro-fiber cloth and see horrible reviews about fraying and lint, it makes me sad"}
{"source": " I have had both of the other items, and this micro-fiber cloth is NOTHING like the other 2"}
{"source": " This item has sewn/seamed edges that will not fray"}
{"source": " It NEVER leave lint behind and it removes fingerprints & smudges and leaves only a nice clean instrument behind"}
{"source": " No scratches, no lint, no hint it was ever there"}
{"source": " My guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth, and I use the thing almost every day"}
{"source": "I got on this rant bc I came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it"}
{"source": " I told him I would just get another"}
{"source": " Then I came here and couldn't remember which version I bought, and the negative reviews seemed to be talking about a completely different item (leaves behind lint?? What the crap are they talking about?)"}
{"source": "turns out they are talking about a completely different item"}
{"source": " I looked up my purchase history and found I had bought the Micro-fiber, then I placed an order for 2 more (1 for me, 1 to give away, again)"}
{"source": "Putting a single item type on a page and having selectors for size or color is fine of course"}
{"source": " Putting an apple and a lemon on the same page (literally) and lumping bad reviews for a horrible product in with great reviews for a wonderful product is just an error that needs to be fixed"}
{"source": " At least now if you managed to find this lone clarifying review hidden among the dozens of other mismatched ones, you know what version to buy and which to avoid"}
{"source": "Anyway, /End rant"}
{"source": "We've all had guitar cleaning cloths and most do a good job"}
{"source": " When I see the word microfiber I always think of those cloths that stick to your fingers when you are using them uck"}
{"source": "This cloth is different it does not have the same feel as most microfiber cloths and it wipes away finger prints and anything else on your guitar body like nothing I've tried before"}
{"source": " With no cleaning solutions needed it magically shines the surface without scratching it"}
{"source": "This would be great for Any instrument or anything else you want to polish without having to use solutions"}
{"source": "Reasonably priced too"}
{"source": "I've owned this pedal for about 8 years"}
{"source": "  It's good overall, but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me"}
{"source": "  They just sound a bit inauthentic, and this is noticeable at times, but in a band setting probably wouldn't be noticable"}
{"source": "  I think it's the way they trail off"}
{"source": "  The tails tend to have a little unnatural decay, or something"}
{"source": "I've been using the Boss Fender reverb pedal for about 3 years now as my main reverb (neither of my amps have reverb) and what I've done in the last year is that I use this Digitech with a wetter setting (usually church or hall) if I want reverb on a solo"}
{"source": "  For that application it works fine and sounds great"}
{"source": "  As a \"leave it on all the time\" reverb I find it a bit lacking"}
{"source": "But if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse"}
{"source": "  Plus this thing is obviously rugged, I've abused it (not really, just regular gigging abuse) for all this time and it's never failed to work"}
{"source": "  But that's been my overall experience with Digitech stuff for a long time"}
{"source": "Purchased this to replace a Behringer pedal because the Behringer introduced a \"swishing\" sound"}
{"source": " This pedal has good choices for reverb types and is relatively noiseless"}
{"source": " Good product and got good price here on Amazon"}
{"source": "This is a great-sounding reverb pedal"}
{"source": " Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound"}
{"source": " I've combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep, rich sounds (watch out for feedback though)"}
{"source": " The design is very solid, and the controls are quite easy to use"}
{"source": " Honestly, I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I won't use very much, but there's no problem with them being there"}
{"source": "I definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon, U2, etc"}
{"source": " Or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones, this is it"}
{"source": " This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar"}
{"source": " My only caveat to this review is that I haven't tried out other reverb pedals, but this one definitely suits all my needs"}
{"source": "This pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like CRAZY! You will want to get a power supply if you opt for this unit"}
{"source": "I'm not too fond of the sound quality of the reverb either- there are a LOT of better sounding units out there but some folks might find it acceptable"}
{"source": "Over all I would not recommend this product"}
{"source": "I have stayed clear of using pedals for most of my playing carrier (over 40 years), but after installing a Fernandes FSK-101 Sustainer kit and getting the same results as most other guys: Too much sustain on adjacent strings which makes the whole experience a joke, I decided to go ahead and try this compressor out and am very happy with the results"}
{"source": " I play mostly clean (jazz, blues, rock) and this unit gives me at least twice the sustain as I would normally get without any pedals"}
{"source": "In my opinion, this is the best guitar volume pedal available"}
{"source": " It is affordable and does exactly what it's supposed to, and does it very, very well I might add"}
{"source": " I've tried numerous volume pedals, from Morley to Line 6 to the Dunlop DVP1, and none are as fluid or feel as good as the Ernie Ball Jr"}
{"source": "I owned the Dunlop DVP1 for several months, and while it did an okay job of cutting the volume I simply did not like the feel nor the low volume levels"}
{"source": " It felt way too bulky under foot and went from about 0 to about 3 when barely applying volume"}
{"source": " This is unacceptable when you're trying to clean up your distortion channel or trying to accomplish a slow volume swell"}
{"source": " But as soon as I laid the Ernie Ball down and plugged it in I fell in love"}
{"source": " Not only does it feel great under your foot and provide precise control, it has a complete volume sweep"}
{"source": " Add in some delay and it will give you an organ-type swell"}
{"source": " Absolutely perfect!I've heard some people complain about the Ernie Ball Jr being a flimsy pedal but I just don't see this"}
{"source": " Of course, it's not a tank like the Dunlop or Morley, but it still feels very solid"}
{"source": " It's also lighter than the others mentioned, which is a plus for traveling musicians"}
{"source": "I would HIGHLY recommend this pedal"}
{"source": " It is one of my favorites on my board and I couldn't imagine playing without it!"}
{"source": "I needed a volume pedal of a smaller stature for my pedal case and this one fits the bill"}
{"source": "AND"}
{"source": "it's heavy duty, accurate and has a real smooth fall off"}
{"source": "If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a Guitar > Volume Pedal > Amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a POORLY engineered pedal"}
{"source": "  It can't be \"true bypass\" as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward"}
{"source": "Anyway, the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable"}
{"source": "  The tone becomes duller, the output drops"}
{"source": "  I would expect that from an Asian knock-off, not from an A-list gear maker"}
{"source": "  I might be over-stating Ernie Ball's reputation, though they make some fine guitars I gotta say, and I've used their strings for many years"}
{"source": "If you plan to use this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine"}
{"source": "  This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker"}
{"source": "  The signal processing takes place in the unit, not the pedal"}
{"source": "  (Those units have their own tone problems but that's another review"}
{"source": ")It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT \"true bypass\" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal"}
{"source": "  I will need to try that out, but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility"}
{"source": "  Major FAIL on their part"}
{"source": "2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple \"first do no harm\" principle"}
{"source": " It harms your tone"}
{"source": "  How dumb is that?  The pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though I have my doubts about their \"string\" mechanism over time"}
{"source": "  The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor"}
{"source": "I have no recommendations for a volume pedal"}
{"source": "  Because of the feel, and esthetics, I do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver"}
{"source": "I've been a gigging musician for almost 20 years, and this is the most well made, most comfortable guitar/bass strap I've ever used"}
{"source": "Pros:- Substantial padding where you need it- Perfect stitching- Heavy, stiff leather ends- Soft, fine-woven material - not the coarse nylon you find in most cheap straps- Underside is lined with an even softer material - makes the strap comfortable even without a shirt on- Did I mention it's super comfortable?Cons:- None to speak of"}
{"source": "  Seriously"}
{"source": "  It's that phenomenal"}
{"source": "Perfect whether you're rocking a featherweight Strat or a 16-pound 6-string bass"}
{"source": "I use it with a 13-pound 5-string Warwick bass, and it makes it feel like the bass is a part of me"}
{"source": "  I hardly notice I'm actually wearing it"}
{"source": "Combine this strap with a decent set of strap locks, and it could easily last you 10 years"}
{"source": "You will not be sorry with this purchase"}
{"source": "I bought this for one of my heavier 5-strings as a replacement strap and love it"}
{"source": "  I use that particular bass for slap and usually hang that bass higher on me that the others for good slap technique"}
{"source": "  This strap adjusts well and the padding is in the right place and comfortable"}
{"source": "Good Strap!"}
{"source": "This bass strap is really comfortable and for a great price"}
{"source": " BTW, that's all I have to say, so don't MAKE me type more"}
{"source": "This is a nice leather mandolin strap"}
{"source": "  Fits fine on my cheap Rogue A type mandolin"}
{"source": "  Amazingly, it is made in Canada, not China!  The leather is very smooth and flexible, not stiff like some cheap straps"}
{"source": "serves its purpose; worked better when I added a quick-disconnect attachment; quality finish, comfortable, and enough range to adjust as needed;"}
{"source": "I am so happy with this product that after buying the first one, I bought two more for my bouzouki and for my octave mandolin"}
{"source": "produce is great price and good quality"}
{"source": " it is just the right size to hold my mandolin while I play"}
{"source": "OK quality and certainly better than a piece of rope"}
{"source": "  I found it a bit uncomfortable for sure but for the money it is worthwhile"}
{"source": "If you are looking for a 100% leather mandolin strap, consider another strap"}
{"source": "  The outside surface of the Planet Waves strap is leather but the inside surface is some kind of man-made material glued to the thin leather part"}
{"source": "  I will be ordering the Levys \"Leather Mandolin Strap (Walnut)\""}
{"source": "Not that many good products/accessories for ukuleles"}
{"source": "  This one is perfect in size and price"}
{"source": "  However, you must be creative when attaching it to the headstock"}
{"source": "  Just give it a little thought"}
{"source": "  Overall it's fine"}
{"source": "If you need it, good unobtrusive device for front or as a momentary back strap"}
{"source": "  Leather or simulated, this was quite adequate for my purposes"}
{"source": "  Price was right! Delivery was immediate"}
{"source": "  Rolls up to fit in gig bag and no doubt would adequately go into the hard case"}
{"source": "  This one is compatible with the finish on my instrument, since it comes in at least two distinct color tones"}
{"source": "Planet Waves Mandolin Strap, Brown"}
{"source": "  Also comes in Black"}
{"source": " There is also an embossed model (Brown) offered at minimumly higher price"}
{"source": "isn't it sad when somebody produces a great product but screws up on the description? The product is great value for money and worth while buying, if for no other reason than save money on overpriced DC power units from the manufacturers of the pedal units"}
{"source": " Trouble is that they do not say whether or not the cables come with the unit"}
{"source": " They don't!! Dumb of them, as all they needed to say  was you needed to buy them separately, which I later did"}
{"source": " Seems like nit picking? Well, it's not as live abroad and these things take a long while to come down to me"}
{"source": " Sloppy isn't it?"}
{"source": "I use this One Spot Adapter with the 5 pedal attachment"}
{"source": " Works perfectly! I've seen reviews about this brand being noisy"}
{"source": " I suspect this to be happening with the 8 pedal version"}
{"source": " Too many for one simple 9 volt source to handle"}
{"source": "I've owned it for a couple of months, used it at home 5 days a week and rehearsed at high volumes about a dozen times"}
{"source": " Zero hum or buzz from the unit"}
{"source": " I should also mention that I do not have any drive/distortion pedals on my board"}
{"source": "I use this at the house for pedal power or for testing new pedals"}
{"source": "I don't use this on my pedal board and don't know if I would recommend it for heavy live use"}
{"source": " I suppose having more than one for reliability would be the key here"}
{"source": "It does work well and will power many pedals at one time"}
{"source": " I do not use it for powering only one pedal though"}
{"source": " This device puts out a lot of juice and will be noisy at times through less expensive pedals"}
{"source": "I also like the fact that it only takes one spot on a power strip without covering up a neighboring power outlet"}
{"source": "Easy to use - it is what it is"}
{"source": "Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board, this was a logical choice of power"}
{"source": " The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs, combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board"}
{"source": " There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak"}
{"source": " Further, with the transformer being well away from the board, there is zero AC hum"}
{"source": " What's not to like here?"}
{"source": "I own a one spot but ran out of plugs for all my pedals"}
{"source": " This product allowed me to lengthen my cord and provide the added power supply that I needed"}
{"source": " No tone loss at all"}
{"source": " Great to have an extension rather than having to get another power supply!!!"}
{"source": "This product works as advertised, but you should beware"}
{"source": " These are RIGHT ANGLED, and they WILL NOT fit in a lot of pedals including the CRYBABY WAH"}
{"source": "You have been warned!!!"}
{"source": "I started by powering 1 stomp box on this chain and it worked, but when I tried to add a second/third stomp box, I couldn't get any guitar sound only a loud buzz"}
{"source": " I returned this product I did further testing, I would not recommend it to anyone"}
{"source": " With my personal experience in mind, I would advise you to save your money and get a pedalboard power supply"}
{"source": " hope this helps"}
{"source": "Good long cable works well with all my pedals, well worth it to get ride of annoying 9 v batteries"}
{"source": "The DiMarzio strap lock system here is hands down the best strap lock system available"}
{"source": "  The Dunlops tend to release if they're bumped, and the Schaller locks can be a bit too bulk for some instruments"}
{"source": "  The DiMarzio models are extremely comfortable, easy to install, and very easy to use"}
{"source": "I recently bought this (May 2011) to use on both my acoustic and electric and it works fine"}
{"source": "PROS:  Non-oily, water-like consistency; leaves no residue behind;  slight non-chemical odor that doesn't linger on your guitar; removes smudges, fingerprints, etc"}
{"source": " and leaves a nice shine; comes with a large lint- and dust-free, fast-drying cloth (black); less expensive than most other guitar polishes"}
{"source": "CONS:  The pump sprays in a very wide area, so be careful to avoid spraying strings, pickups, etc"}
{"source": "The polish in the bottle works well and the lint-free cloth works well too"}
{"source": "  I can't see spending more for Gibson or Dunlop polish kits when this work just fine"}
{"source": "The cleaner works as it should and the price is fair but what really did it for me is the cloth"}
{"source": " Just feels right for the job"}
{"source": "Probably the best single thing this cable has going for it is the Lifetime Warranty"}
{"source": "I have owned Planet Waves cables in the past and twice I have sent them back for replacement"}
{"source": "no problems whatsoever"}
{"source": "For the price you are paying (about $1 dollar per foot) you get good quality cable, good cores and shielding with heavy duty retention at the jack connector ends"}
{"source": "Not the best, but not the worst"}
{"source": " Good enough for live stage gigging and probably won't notice much difference if you are recording"}
{"source": "I haven't noticed any RF hum or noise when moving about with these cables"}
{"source": "They also come with a set of colored bands so you can easily identify which cable goes to where, cable owner, etc"}
{"source": "Affordable price and lifetime warranty make this a \"feel good\" purchase"}
{"source": "I would recommend these cables and will buy again"}
{"source": "I have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my Mogami Gold cables"}
{"source": "  If you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound, this might not be the cable for you"}
{"source": "HOWEVER, for the price and purpose this a five star cable"}
{"source": "  The plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection, but also feel sturdy and secure"}
{"source": "  The gold plating ensures a solid connection"}
{"source": "What I like most about this cable is that it's guaranteed for life and I can bring it to a Planet Waves authorized dealer for a replacement"}
{"source": " or so their packaging claims"}
{"source": "  I have not had to replace mine"}
{"source": "I read a lot of positive reviews on the 9"}
{"source": "5s and after some use, I am kind of disappointed"}
{"source": "CONSTRUCTION:They are just like any other strings, just lighter gaugePACKAGING:It arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionPRICE:At $4"}
{"source": "99 new with free 2 day shipping, this is a no brainer"}
{"source": "CONCLUSION:I initially liked the feel of these strings, but the more I played the more I realized that it didnt have the tone I was looking for"}
{"source": " I am used to 10s and 11s and though they are more difficult to bend with, they sound much fuller"}
{"source": " I put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with 10s"}
{"source": "I actually wasn't aware of this gauge of string until I purchased a guitar from the great George Lynch"}
{"source": " The strings felt different than the 9s I use on my Fenders and the 10s I use on my Gibsons"}
{"source": " So the next time I saw George, I asked him what strings he put on that guitar and he told me D'Addario 9"}
{"source": "5s"}
{"source": " I love them on my Mr Scary Guitars Burnt Tiger and that is the only brand/gauge of string that I will ever put on that guitar! I definitely recommend trying out a set"}
{"source": "These strings are best suited for Strats if you want to keep those easy to bend leads but have a little bit more tone"}
{"source": " They're also quite good on Les Paul style guitars if you like slinky strings"}
{"source": " My issue with them is that the B string and the A string are a bit unbalanced with respect to the others"}
{"source": " I would prefer if the B string were 0"}
{"source": "012 instead of 0"}
{"source": "0115 and if the A were 0"}
{"source": "032 instead of 0"}
{"source": "034"}
{"source": " As such, I prefer to buy the strings individually and customize my own set that way"}
{"source": " But if you're not too picky, this will suit you very well"}
{"source": "guitar string 9"}
{"source": "5 between 9 and 10"}
{"source": "  Does its job for those who want strings that are easier to bend than 10 and not as noodlely as 9"}
{"source": "I've used D'Addario's on so many different Guitar's the only opinion I can honestly give Ya is that They are the best"}
{"source": " In the Studio or on Stage, They stay in tune and work very well with any pickup You are using"}
{"source": " I put these on My Wife's Bass cause She is still learning and with a Fender Squire it sounds almost as good as a Precision Fender Bass"}
{"source": " They stay true to the note so She will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time"}
{"source": "I use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars, except for the smaller Takamine New Yorker and A&L; Ami (I use the D'Addario custom lights)"}
{"source": "  I have grown a fondness for the Phosphor Bronze strings because of the perfect balance between the warm full sound with strumming and bright tones when picking"}
{"source": "  ALso, the brightness is retained longer than other bronze and brass alloys I've tried, such as Martins and Elixirs"}
{"source": "  These strings are quite durable and long-lasting"}
{"source": "  In the 10 years I've been playing, I've never had these strings break on me (I've broken Martin and Elixir strings in the past)"}
{"source": "  The color-coded end balls help with the restringing"}
{"source": "  I typically get the three-pack so I can restring a trio set of my herd at a time"}
{"source": "  I really can't complain about anything"}
{"source": "The individual gauges are: "}
{"source": "012, "}
{"source": "016, "}
{"source": "024w, "}
{"source": "032w, "}
{"source": "042w, "}
{"source": "053wHighly recommended"}
{"source": "I've use these strings for years"}
{"source": " I play often and like to change strings often"}
{"source": " I can do it without breaking the bank and they hold up well for many practices and gigs"}
{"source": " They hold tune very we (at least on my guitar) indoors and out"}
{"source": " I'd highly recommend them"}
{"source": "These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine"}
{"source": " I love the EJ16 light gauge for their size and ease of use"}
{"source": " I think the light gauge is a nice size that won't hurt your fingers, or put undue stress on your guitar"}
{"source": " Not only that, but they sound great"}
{"source": " Not too big or not too small! I have plenty of volume and drive for bluegrass"}
{"source": " I love how they color code their strings on the \"ball ends\""}
{"source": " To me this makes it much easier when changing strings"}
{"source": " You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings"}
{"source": " I've also had no problem with the fit; unlike some brands"}
{"source": " Give these a try"}
{"source": " I think you'll be satisfied"}
{"source": "I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar, and I also wanted to have backup strings"}
{"source": "  I haven't tried many different strings"}
{"source": "  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S, and it's been good for year+"}
{"source": " IIf the strings break, I will try this one GS330S as well"}
{"source": "  Over all, I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones"}
{"source": " After the strings were set and \"stretch\" for few days playing, it stays in tune"}
{"source": "  The strings were set for more than 6 months, they still are playable, and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar"}
{"source": "  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S"}
{"source": "  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings"}
{"source": "I play resonator guitars open tuned"}
{"source": " These are the only strings that hold up well to the tension of an open &#34;A&#34; tuning"}
{"source": " I recently tried multiple other brands and gauges (almost every B string snapped / to C#) only to come back to these"}
{"source": " Only wish they came in packs of 10 cause I go through about three sets a month (3 guitars)"}
{"source": "Well made"}
{"source": " Enjoyable to play"}
{"source": " Stay in tune well"}
{"source": " The sound is clear and warm on my Yamaha and my Martin"}
{"source": " Right now I am experimenting with different strings so I cant say if they are better than others"}
{"source": " I personally like the sound better than the Martin ESs I have tried but that is a personal choice"}
{"source": " Let your guitar be the judge"}
{"source": "I tried these strings on my Zager guitar"}
{"source": "  the are certainly ok and play fine"}
{"source": "  they are nothing far and above the original strings provided thru Zager"}
{"source": "  just a little cheaper in cost perhaps"}
{"source": "  maybe they will last longer"}
{"source": "  I had some problem with my original strings as the high strings started to rust in the case due to the humidity I put in there for the guitar wood (I live in hot and very dry Arizona)"}
{"source": "  these have not rusted, so far"}
{"source": "These are the best strings I've ever put on my guitar, I play a really nice Morgan Monroe Creekside and these strings give it the fullness it deserves"}
{"source": " The bright highs, the rich mids, and they bend like crazy when I need them too"}
{"source": "This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments"}
{"source": "  The strings last a long time, in my opinion"}
{"source": "  They keep their bright look and sound, even when my friend with acid for sweat borrows my guitar"}
{"source": "I have always liked D'Addario's packaging"}
{"source": "  Instead of each string coming in an individual envelope marked with the gauge, D'Addario color codes the ball end of the string -- so the G is green, the low E is brass (I think - I'm doing this from memory), the high E is silver, and so on"}
{"source": " I really like that -- there isn't an explosion of paper at a gig when I have to change a string quickly"}
{"source": " It's a learning curve -- once you know the system it's great, but the first few times, it's a bit of a hassle to reference the package to find which color string goes where"}
{"source": "D'Addario is my favorite string, hands down, after almost 40 years of playing"}
{"source": "I've been playing for 40+ years"}
{"source": "  I've seen dozens of guitars come and go until I found my 1948 Gibson J-45 and I've tried dozens of types of strings"}
{"source": "  Some guitars sound best with Phosphor Bronze"}
{"source": "  Some sound best with 80/20s"}
{"source": "  I still have an all Koa Martin guitar that is *so* bright that it sounds best with the normally tone-killing Elixir Polywebs"}
{"source": " Got a guitar-banjo? Try silk-and-steel or silk-and-phosphor"}
{"source": " Trust me"}
{"source": "  I've been through my John Pearse phase"}
{"source": " Pyramids?  Yep"}
{"source": " Tried 'em"}
{"source": "  I really liked LaBellas"}
{"source": "  The problem was that back when I was using them, they would tarnish in the packaging"}
{"source": "  I don't know if that's still the case"}
{"source": "Anyway, the bottom line is that D'Addario phosphor bronze are my go to string"}
{"source": "  They set the baseline for every guitar I've ever owned"}
{"source": "  (Note: That's baseline"}
{"source": " In some cases, I've decided something else sounded better"}
{"source": ")  For many guitars, including my J-45, there's nothing I've found that I've liked better"}
{"source": "Also worth noting:  The string that sounds best depends not only on the particular guitar, but also on the type of pick one uses, the type of music one plays, and the way one approaches the instrument"}
{"source": "  The string that's best for bluegrass with a hard attack may not be what's best for delicate finger style"}
{"source": "Bottom line: Don't follow leaders"}
{"source": "  Watch the parkin' meters"}
{"source": "  Experiment"}
{"source": "  But, D'Addario PBs are a great place to start"}
{"source": "Bought these to try them out the medium gauge and brand"}
{"source": " Mediums too hard on my thin fingers and will stick to light and extra light gauges"}
{"source": " The strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I didn't like"}
{"source": " Tone is warm but too mellow for my tastes"}
{"source": " G-string snapped 2 days later at the windings with the string wounds pried right off :\\"}
{"source": "I've used these strings for longer than I'd care to admit"}
{"source": "  String sound is a personal thing"}
{"source": "  These work better for me than any others I've tried"}
{"source": "  To my ear they have a balanced timbre across the sound spectrum"}
{"source": " The five star rating is a reflection of my personal taste"}
{"source": " Others may prefer a different sound"}

{"source": " Thanks"}
{"source": "The strings sound great on my full size acoustic - nice bright, but warm tone, full bodied sound - but not so great on my 3/4 size guitar"}
{"source": "I'm enjoying using this priced-right set of strings"}

{"source": "I have restored an old REX Commander"}
{"source": "  Yeah, I know;  never heard of it"}
{"source": "  Beautiful old archtop acoustic with real mother of pearl rectangular inlays on the neck"}
{"source": "  Frets filed nearly flat after over a half century of playing"}
{"source": "  But the resonance of the D'Addario's really bring this old guitar to life with a thick juicy vibrance on the bass side, and bell like clarity on the treble side"}
{"source": "  Not to mention how great they look"}
{"source": "  The snap and sparkle of the responsiveness of these stings amazes me"}
{"source": "  Terrific strings for the price of cheapies"}
{"source": "Not much to say here"}
{"source": " Strings are a very personal thing to a guitar player"}
{"source": " You need to try different gauges and brands till you find the ones that work best for you and your style"}
{"source": " These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years"}
{"source": " I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year"}
{"source": " The strings are great, priced great and was on sale which made it even better"}
{"source": " There is less waste with the packaging which help the planet just a bit so that's good too"}
{"source": "D'Addario,what's up? These didn't last long at all"}
{"source": "I don't play my Martin very often,(too busy with electrics"}
{"source": ") but these were trashed in a month"}
{"source": "Guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now? Never purchase again"}
{"source": "I recently acquired a Guild six string that I strung with my usual EJ16 strings, however, it just wasn't playing or sounding as good as I knew it could"}
{"source": "  After tweaking the action and restringing with EJ17 Mediums, that Guild has sounds great with plenty of punch & power to spare"}
{"source": "Overall, I rely on D'Addario strings for all my instruments"}
{"source": " What's not to love about a 300+ year-old, family-owned company that (beginning with the days of catgut) has been responsible for dozens of string making innovations?  Beyond great tone & playability, these suckers are reliable as all get-out"}
{"source": " These days if a string breaks, I know right away I need to check the nut & saddle, because these strings don't snap unless something on the instrument caused damage"}
{"source": " In fact, I used to snap strings every other performance before I learned to properly hone the string rests on my instrument and use NOTHING but D'Addario strings"}
{"source": " I haven't broken a string during a performance in years, and believe me, I ain't being gentle with 'em"}
{"source": "received in just a few days"}
{"source": "to a beginner like me they like like good strings but what do I know"}
{"source": "I bought these strings to replace the strings on my Hofner acoustic"}
{"source": " The gauge is pretty good for a deeper tone"}
{"source": " I might try a lighter set next time, but these have a good clear tone from low to high, and are fairly comfortable"}
{"source": "I have many so-called travel size acoustic guitars and have changed out all of the over sized strings that were installed on them (typically 12-54's) with these 10-47's (or 11-52's for beefy 7/8 and 3/4 scale guitars) in all cases, has brought the smaller guitars from duds to nice playing instruments"}
{"source": "Three radical samples come to mind: On an old 1931 Gibson L1, the 12-54's pulled the bridge out"}
{"source": "On an SX Traveler, you could not hear the Low E until I got rid of the 12-54's"}
{"source": "On my Lil Martin, the lower bout started to delam under the pressure of the bridge pull"}
{"source": "Short scale acoustic guitars are someplace between a full size acoustic and a Ukulele and in most cases are not set up for heavier gauge strings (even though the manufacturers insist on delivering them this way) due to their short scales, small frets, and light construction"}
{"source": "If you can't hear the low E, or you are having problems fretting your strings, try these, what can it hurt?"}
{"source": "First of all, let me say, from some of the pictures I have seen posted of this Pop Filter, when put on a Yeti mic stand, the clamp will fit on the stand as pictured"}
{"source": " This is a design flaw, not with the Pop Filter, but with the Yeti stand, as this filter has been around long before the Yeti came out"}
{"source": " Blue, or a clever do it yourself person, could easily fix it, by drilling more holes into the side of the clamp mount"}
{"source": " Then you could move it forward and simply screw the side mic mount screws into the stand"}
{"source": " There are many great pictures of other clever fixes, as well"}
{"source": "  Since I have mine hanging upside down, on a boom stand attached to a Blue Radius Shock mount, this is not an issue for me, but I will say it is a problem Blue should fix"}
{"source": " (I have written an addendum on the bottom, for a great fix"}
{"source": ") Other brands of filters will give the same, if not more problems"}
{"source": " I am not going to knock any stars off, because I'm reviewing the filter itself, which is superb and how it works for me"}
{"source": "Now for the meat"}
{"source": " This is a studio grade, high quality product, all metal, except for the two tightening knobs"}
{"source": " The dual screen design eliminates any plosives, P's and B's for example, better than any screen I have used so far"}
{"source": " This is especially true when, the screen distance is about an inch from the Yeti capsule screen, and you are 4 to 6 inches away from the unit itself, which I have found to be the Yeti's sweet spot in the Cardioid pattern"}
{"source": " Next the silk screened Blue logo also helps you find the sweet spot, if you place it in front of the capsule area"}
{"source": " I like the idea of a metal screen, especially if you are transporting it, you won't have to worry about snagging,or runs, as you do with the cloth filters"}
{"source": " Speaking of old cloth filters, I have a Neumann, which is about 12 years old, a very nice screen as well, but it does not cut the pops as well as the Blue, especially if you get closer to the mic and screen"}
{"source": " Also when reading copy, or maybe music, I can see over and through the Blue filter, much better than the round 6 & 1/4 inch jobs Like the Neumann"}
{"source": " You can contort the neck of the filter in any position easily, cheaper filters I have used in the past, will creep back into unwanted positions, the Blue behaves"}
{"source": " The Blue Pop is absolutely transparent, no muffling, as with foam filters, The curved design of the Blue Filter also protects the sides from plosives and possible proximity errors of a poorly placed screen or none at all"}
{"source": " The screen is a solid build, as are all of the Blue products I have used so far"}
{"source": " It also fits the look of the Yeti and Radius Shock Mount like a glove"}
{"source": " Surprisingly, I paid a little over $30"}
{"source": "00 on Amazon, a real bargain in my mind, for such high quality"}
{"source": " This filter is for all the Blue Microphones by the way, and I am going to use it on my entire collection of mics!10/7/11 AddendumIf you need to use the Yeti as a table top mic, especially if you are using a shock mount and pop filter (any brand), I would suggest buying aSamson SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand, which works great for this set up!"}
{"source": "This pop filter is built like a tank compared to those cheap cloth and plastic versions that you get at the discount music stores, so it's a bit more expensive, but the quality and functionality is like night and day"}
{"source": "  I use it in front of my Shure Beta 58A, and it's absolutely perfect"}
{"source": "This is a beautiful shock mount"}
{"source": " However for the price it didnt perform"}
{"source": " The mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on P's and S's"}
{"source": " Not worth the price"}
{"source": "I was not happy with the sound of these strings"}
{"source": " The EAD steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon GBE strings sound tinny"}
{"source": " For an extra $2 I bought the D'Addario EJ45 Pro Arte and got a much, much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old Yamaha G-60"}
{"source": "  Spend the extra $2 its well worth it"}
{"source": "These strings sound great"}
{"source": " I was really impressed by the sound"}
{"source": " They stay in tune very nicely"}
{"source": " Great for beginners and intermediate players"}
{"source": " I would recommend them"}
{"source": "i've used d'addario strings for bass, electric, acoustic, and classic"}
{"source": " even though this string was my first time use and it haven't failed me yet!! it's very stable and in tune all time while playing"}
{"source": " highly recommand to other ppl"}
{"source": "I bought a Rogue mandolin from a friend (who bought from Amazon but did not have time to even play it) for only 25$, still brand new, never played"}
{"source": "I have owned and played many other mandolins (about a dozen), this one is mainly for me to practice my mandolin setup skills"}
{"source": " The mandolin is NOT playable in its brand new state (not in tune, action too high, lower action will result in string buzzes)"}
{"source": " And this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup"}
{"source": " I went thru all the necessary steps (almost like a luthier would do) and it came out sweet"}
{"source": " It now has very low action, no string buzz, very good intonation"}
{"source": " One can find info about mandolin setup on the Web"}
{"source": " It's quite tedious work"}
{"source": "This will be my beater mandolin, at 25$, nothing can beat it"}
{"source": "It stay in tune long enough for me to play one hour straight without having to re-tune"}
{"source": " So this is more than adequate for daily practice"}
{"source": " Often times, it even stay in tune the next days"}
{"source": " I may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one"}
{"source": " The finish on this model has some blemish (some small black spots on top the sunburst color), but only if you look really close, I would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred, at less than 40$, no problem at all"}
{"source": "Of course, this mandolin is no match for more expensive models/brands (such as Kentucky) but I gave it a 5 stars based on its high performance / cost ratio"}
{"source": "If you don't know how to setup mandolin, then be prepared to pay 60$ to 80$ for a professional setup (which is a must, otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune)"}
{"source": " Some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge (that's unfair)"}
{"source": " All brand new mandolins require setup (at this expense), unless the store did the setup and charge a higher price for it"}
{"source": "If you are lucky to know someone who can setup for free, that would save you the cost of two mandolins like this !!!"}
{"source": "I got one of these years ago as a starter mandolin"}
{"source": " Do they sound as good as a 5K Gibson F5? Not hardly"}
{"source": " Do they sound good for a 40-50 dollar Chinese built instrument out of the cheapest materials they could find? Actually, yeah, they do"}
{"source": " This is one of those instruments where a case can cost as much or more then it does so I wouldn't worry about that"}
{"source": " When you get it, the action is likely to be high and if you can't lower the bridge enough with the wheels it's easy enough to sand some off the bottom"}
{"source": " Also, like most cheap instruments the strings that are on it are trash"}
{"source": " Just throw them out or strangle the cat with them or something"}
{"source": " Decent strings don't cost very much"}
{"source": "Depending on what they sent you and how the labor force was the day it was built, you actually might have a piece of firewood or a pretty playable (after you fix the bridge and strings"}
{"source": ") little instrument"}
{"source": " The hardware isn't the best and the tuners suck but hey, if you're just starting out, tuning is part of the game"}
{"source": "For $49"}
{"source": "99 (and I've seen new ones 10 bucks less from time to time) it's worth the investment"}
{"source": " You can spend more on dinner and a movie, and after you ate and watched the flick, it's gone"}
{"source": " With the money spent here, you'll have something to keep you entertained until it falls apart and that will be much longer then one evening"}
{"source": " My 7 year old boy owns mine now and he beats the hell out of it, so far, so good"}
{"source": " It's been holding up well"}
{"source": "BTW, if $49"}
{"source": "99 breaks you, and you discover lessons cost more then your mandolin (been there), since you're here reading this, that means you're on the net and you can get plenty of starter lessons on youtube that will get you going, after that, you can find MANY good books/cds/dvds that will help you along even further and one day you'll get a better instrument"}
{"source": " I'm actually thinking of getting another one to beat around on so I don't take the chance of ruining my good one while camping or whatever, and if I get cold and run out of wood, these are almost cheap enough to burn"}
{"source": "One thing you may or may not know is the resale value on these"}
{"source": " If you go to certain online classifieds (CL coughcoughcough) you'll notice people ask 50 bucks or MORE for these, sometimes over 100"}
{"source": " USED"}
{"source": " Same with pawnshops, and those people know what these cost new"}
{"source": " This is one of the few cases where I'd buy new over used"}
{"source": " If you decide to sell it and as long as it's not in pieces it'll still bring 20-30 bucks used so you won't be out much, but really, it's a good servicable instrument with a little work, but if you're lucky it might actually be set up right when you get it"}
{"source": " Again though, not that big a deal to fix if it's not"}
{"source": "Oh, as stated elsewhere these don't have trussrods"}
{"source": " That's not bad in itself"}
{"source": " You'd be surprised how many mandolins didn't have them years ago and alot of them are still around"}
{"source": " Even from some big makers"}
{"source": " If the neck warps in a year or two, no big deal, you got your moneys worth"}
{"source": " Mines been kicking around for awhile, and the last year a 7 year old (6 at the time) has been beating on it and I can still pick it up, tune it and play it"}
{"source": "Don't panic, strings marked A/D/F#/B CAN be used just fine for G/C/E/A tuning"}
{"source": " They don't seem to be quite as nice as the comparable Aquilas, but they're half the price"}
{"source": " They were for a $20 uke"}
{"source": " (And yeah, new $4 strings do improve the sound on a $20 uke!)"}
{"source": "These are great strings for such a \"rare\" instrument"}
{"source": " Not many people play the baritone yuke - it has a unique quality to it, sort of like a miniature classical guitar"}
{"source": " These strings sound full and warm on the instrument"}
{"source": "Bought these strings as a replacement to ones that came with my ukulele (the originals only lasted a week)"}
{"source": "  These D'Addario's have worn quite well and still sound excellent"}
{"source": "  Great strings!"}
{"source": "First off, I'm NO ukulele expert"}
{"source": " That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these"}
{"source": " I know they stated Concert, however, reading up on this, they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke"}
{"source": " Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings"}
{"source": " Like another reviewer said, it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke, but it sure helped out a lot"}
{"source": " The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well"}
{"source": " I'm loving the sound"}
{"source": " Also, I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch"}
{"source": "  I would definitely recommend these"}
{"source": "The most annoying thing about modern ideas in Ukulele strings, or indeed in Guitar strings, is to wind them with aluminum wire - making at the least a black deposit of aluminum on my hands, or at worst, cognitive damage skin contact with them"}
{"source": " These rather inexpensive strings are not aluminum wound, but are silver plate wound - no health problems possible from strings makes them the best"}
{"source": "I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar, and will soon replace them"}
{"source": "  On quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar"}
{"source": "  String did not break as I rather expected, but it looks bad"}
{"source": "  On sound, these seemed okay at first, but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and E steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me"}
{"source": "  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck, more so than other sets I have used"}
{"source": "Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball"}
{"source": "I just had a guitar setup with DR Pure Blues 9's and they sound pretty good but they are a bit stiff"}
{"source": "I've also noticed a bit of what I must presume is the nickel coating seems to come off on my fingertips after practicing for an hour or so"}
{"source": "It almost looks like graphite on my fingers but it is nowhere near as \"black\" as the oxidation I've seen from low-quality strings"}
{"source": "They also seem to have more \"string squeak\" when changing chords than other brands - even after generously spritzing them withFingerease Guitar String LubricantI am not qualified to say if they truly give you that \"vintage tone\" but they do sound decent"}
{"source": "However, for $6 I would rather getDean Markley Blue Steel LT 2552 Electric Guitar Strings ("}
{"source": "009-"}
{"source": "042)or save some money and go withD'Addario EXL120 Electric Guitar Strings, Super Light, 9-42"}
{"source": "EvenErnie Ball Super Slinky String Set (9 - 42)seem to feel better to me, but I am a Da-Dairy-O man, for now"}
{"source": "What can I say that has not been said about the other DRs that I have used"}
{"source": " They rock, roll, andbend with the greatest of ease; once broken in, of course"}
{"source": " If you want a mellower, bluesier stringwith decent sustain try DR Pure Blues"}
{"source": "I decided to use 9's on my Fender Tele hollow-body because the company puts 9s on their guitars"}
{"source": "I didn't want to worry about the nut being the wrong size and causing untold noises so I stuckwith the 9s"}
{"source": " Hey, the Rev uses 7's; size does not matter when it comes to strings and tone"}
{"source": "The other reason for the Pure Nickels was to tone down the ice pickiness one can get from P-90pick ups"}
{"source": " Pure Nickels seem to mellow that out for me a bit"}
{"source": " One more reason is that nickel iseasier on your frets; which is a good thing"}
{"source": " Steel will wear down your frets a lot faster"}
{"source": "I will say that my very first set of DR Pure Blues went bad after a few weeks"}
{"source": " The windings brokeon the D-string at two places where the string fretted"}
{"source": " The reason I kept going back to DR Bluesis that I have not had one problem on any of my electric guitars (4 solid bodies & another hollow-body) since then"}
{"source": " Giving DR a second chance convinced me they will last and that my very firstuse in 2010 was a fluke"}
{"source": "If you want strings that are an easier bend than steel or steel core nickels go with DR Pure Blues"}
{"source": "Allegedly they are supposed to help give you vintage tone"}
{"source": " This is because prior to the mid-40'smost strings were made of nickel"}
{"source": " During WWII nickel was in short supply and so steel was used tomake the strings"}
{"source": " Or so the historical theory goes"}
{"source": "Gradually nickel wrapped steel strings and then pure nickel strings came back into vogue as playersbegan searching for the old vintage sound"}
{"source": " To achieve the \"vintage\" tone I am sure you would alsoneed the right amp AND the right touch to get to that point"}
{"source": " I am not necessarily looking for a\"vintage\" tone but love how easily these strings bend and how long they last"}
{"source": " Your exact mileagemay differ"}
{"source": "I have also never had anything rub off of the strings onto my fingers"}
{"source": " The only time I get my fingersdirty is after oiling the fret board"}
{"source": " There is usually is some residual oil left no matter how much I wipethe fret board"}
{"source": " Definitely not the strings though"}
{"source": " I have also never heard any string-squeak from thestrings that would give me pause either"}
{"source": " Any string, even on acoustic, will squeak occasionally"}
{"source": " Withan electric who knows if the pickups were set too high, or the nut is not cut right, or the wrong sizestring is used for the nut"}
{"source": "Well there you go; what I have experienced with DR Pure Blues Nickel Wrap Round Core strings"}
{"source": " I willalso say that on guitar forums that I frequent more people are giving DR kudos on their customerservice as well as their strings"}
{"source": " So if you do get a bum string give them a holler"}
{"source": " Now get out thereand play your heart out"}
{"source": " Oh and how about working on that \"vintage\" tone while you are at it"}
{"source": "Have fun"}
{"source": "I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret"}
{"source": "I put these in my Ibanez EW acoustic-electric as a cosmetic upgrade and the tone and sustain is absolutely amazing, not to mention they look fantastic"}
{"source": " They fit like they were made for this bridge but rubbed a bit of pine tar in the holes with a q-tip to make sure they seated fully"}
{"source": " Absolutely tickled with the look and performance"}
{"source": " VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"source": "Impressed with this set, I installed them today and have been playing for a few hours"}
{"source": " My wife thinks my guitar looks better now, and I agree"}
{"source": " Im not sure if they are supposed to be flush, and they stick out just a little bit but they have not popped out"}
{"source": " I think my guitars tone has improved a little too, but I also installed new strings"}
{"source": " Qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins!"}
{"source": "It works really well and it's really thin"}
{"source": " It's thinner than i thought"}
{"source": " The price it's about right"}
{"source": " I needed only 3 of these but since if you buy one at the time is more expensive than to buy the box i got this"}
{"source": "These are really great bang for the buck, however, like many people said, they do not work well for all my pedals, round ends don't fit in everything"}
{"source": "I mean these are cables"}
{"source": "compact heads allow more pedals to be loaded onto your overpriced pedal board"}
{"source": "  the quality is good"}
{"source": " I like how they are easy to take apart and modify and put together again"}
{"source": "  very handy for making it all just right"}
{"source": "  I will buy these again for sure"}
{"source": "Hosa, has good cables"}
{"source": " I use them between my guitar effects pedals and then a 5 footer from effects to the amp"}
{"source": " Had them over two months a they work great"}
{"source": "These are very good quality in spite of their reasonable price"}
{"source": " I love the flat, low profile, right angle plugs"}
{"source": " My only complaint is I needed some in varying lengths (like 15&#34;) and so I had to order the Planet waves kit to make my own to finish the pedalboard"}
{"source": "I've never had a problem with these patch cables"}
{"source": " I'm running 6 pedals and no issues like crackling or cutting out"}
{"source": "One thing that is important to note is that I'm not hard on my gear"}
{"source": " I'm a home noodler, so I can't say if these patches can take road/stage abuse and lots of setup/tear-down cycles"}
{"source": " They seem pretty buff and capable, but I can only report what I've experienced"}
{"source": "These are sturdy, just the right length, and the design means that you can save space in arranging your effects pedals, with enough length and flexibility to arrange them in a semicircle if, like me, you have a lot of pedals"}
{"source": "all 12 of mine broke within a year and the jacks got bent pretty easily"}
{"source": " so I switched back to the plastic ones which have lasted me over 2 yearsHosa CFS606 6 Inch Right Angle FX Pedal Cable, 6 Packand they are still going strong"}
{"source": "Going to these from what I was using, I can fit 2 more pedals on my pedalboard, so mission accomplished!"}
{"source": "I love these patch cables"}
{"source": "  They can be serviced if need be, but mine have never needed it"}
{"source": "  I've ordered about 3 batches of these guys and I would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex"}
{"source": "  The length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected, and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes"}
{"source": "  However there are many cables of much lesser value, which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown"}
{"source": "Simple"}
{"source": " Solid"}
{"source": " Compact"}
{"source": " Convenient"}
{"source": " Audio quality is unchanged from my no name metal patch cables"}
{"source": " For the money, you can't beat a six pack of these to open up some extra space on your board and clean it up a bit"}
{"source": "I've had it for almost 3 years now"}
{"source": " not a single problem! I've changed my setup like crazy, sometimes even the cables had to be twisted in some certain position on a pedalboard"}
{"source": " Been bent on the edge of the cable right before the connector, been pulled (normal way) and stomped, never a single cut offs on the connection"}
{"source": "Don't worry too much about cables like a sissy bedroom princess guitarists, you're using od/distortion pedals anyway right? If you're a purist, don't ever use a pedals or even electric guitar"}
{"source": " Good luck!"}
{"source": "They have good ends, they do feel a little flimsy on the cord side of things"}
{"source": " They have good signal though and don't seem to alter the tone"}
{"source": " I have them all on my pedalboard now so time will tell if they hold up or not"}
{"source": "I had been having lots of trouble with my guitars falling from the leather ended straps"}
{"source": "  Not any more"}
{"source": "  These locking ends are the ticket!  They are quick to release and adjust, and fit very well"}
{"source": "  They are bulky when putting the guitar in a case, but I just leave them on"}
{"source": "  The strap itself is plain, but it highlights the beauty of my guitar"}
{"source": "  It's a must for any rambunctious guitar player"}
{"source": "Good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice"}
{"source": "This was my first guitar strap i had ever bought"}
{"source": " I didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by"}
{"source": " Over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic I recently got and it keeps popping off"}
{"source": " This is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house"}
{"source": " The guitar could take that head dive of death, while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse"}
{"source": "My Advice: unless you plan to sit and play (which you wont really need a strap anyways) the whole time, spend alittle more to get a leather strap"}
{"source": " Spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play"}
{"source": "This device is the best you can buy"}
{"source": "  There is nothing negative to write about it if you put the slightly high price aside"}

{"source": " Play coffee shops and will help if I drop my pick"}
{"source": " Very good price"}
{"source": "Not much to say - it's a pic holder that attaches to a music/mic stand and holds pics"}
{"source": "As advertised, it does indeed attach nicely and easily and snugly to my music/mic stands, and it does, in fact, snuggly and easily hold pics"}
{"source": "Well worth the small cost"}
{"source": "Just exactly as stated, this is a small rubber piece to hook on your mic stand or guitar stand"}
{"source": " Holds 6 picks"}
{"source": " It is exactly what I wanted for a great price"}
{"source": " Thanks!Editing this review to say that today I got a few thin picks and the \"thin\" picks do not hold in this"}

{"source": "  You can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge"}
{"source": "  My violin's tone doesn't change much at all with this mute"}
{"source": "Now I can practice all I want without fear of my wife divorcing me!"}
{"source": "I can not evaluate the product until the instrument I purchased is repaired or returned"}
{"source": "  Sorry,  I had rather not comment until it is used"}
{"source": "I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together"}
{"source": " I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews"}
{"source": " The mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works VERY well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing"}
{"source": " There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on"}
{"source": " Also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises"}
{"source": "If You want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), I suggest you buy something else"}
{"source": " This item does not work and is a total waste of money"}
{"source": " I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new Electric Violin bought here on Amazon (FYI, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! *Just make sure you buyThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsley& aGlaesel Self-Adjusting 4/4 Violin Bridge Mediumwith it!)"}
{"source": "I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all"}
{"source": " It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way"}
{"source": "I'm not sure how much I can say about a mute"}
{"source": " It's easy to put on and take off, and it does its job"}
{"source": " It mutes the violin to a reasonable level"}
{"source": "  I used an SPL meter at a distance where a sustained open G string gave a reading of about +2db"}
{"source": " With the mute, it dropped to -6db"}
{"source": " I then tried a Yamaha silent electric violin (unplugged) and from the same distance, it barely registered"}
{"source": " I recalibrated the meter so the muted acoustic violin read about 1db, and the Yamaha read about -6db at that distance and setting"}
{"source": "So it won't make your instrument completely silent, and from a purely subjective perspective, it seemed to bring things closer to the silent violin, perhaps seeming about 10 to 20% louder had I not measured it"}
{"source": "With accessories, tonal quality is typically important"}
{"source": " But with a mute, you expect it to deteriorate"}
{"source": " Surprisingly, there was still a lot of tone left, especially compared to the unplugged electric, yet there were no buzzes or other horrible artifacts introduced"}
{"source": "You can't expect this to give great sound or complete silence, but it won't disturb the neighbors or their dogs, and it won't make the instrument sound dead"}
{"source": " This is about 15 times cheaper than the cheapest silent violin, and the latter will probably sound worse"}
{"source": " It's not the ultimate solution for quietness but it lets you stick to your instrument of choice"}
{"source": "This pedal is solidly built, and works as advertised"}
{"source": "  If you're using it strictly as a volume pedal, it does the job nicely"}
{"source": "The only problem with it is when you use it as an expression pedal -- it has no polarity switch for expression output"}
{"source": "Plugged into some gear as an expression pedal (my Digitech RP55, for example), the down position is muted and the up position is full volume (the opposite of where it should be), and wah effects are backwards as well"}
{"source": "  There's no way to correct this without making your own crossover cable (which requires destroying a perfectly good patch cable)"}
{"source": "I got this pedal recently"}
{"source": "  All in all, it's a pretty nice device, expecially for the price"}
{"source": "  Seems solid and well-made"}
{"source": "  It has a nice big pedal for big feet"}
{"source": "  It works smoothly"}
{"source": "  I have found no drawbacks to the operation or quality of this pedal"}
{"source": "  My only gripe, is that the power for the pedal is either by an internal 9V battery, or a 12V plug in power supply"}
{"source": "  Why the difference?  The really bad part (for me) is that I bought this to install in a newly-purchased Behringer pedal board, which comes with a 9V power supply"}
{"source": "  So, in order for me to use this pedal in the board, I will have to run two different power supplies, or run the pedal on battery and everything else off of the pedalboard's power supply"}
{"source": "  [Behringer"}
{"source": "this was not thought out very well"}
{"source": "]  I'm now in the process of making myself an voltage adapter, but finding all the right parts has proven so far to be a hassle"}
{"source": "  Bottom line:  the pedal itself is great, but the power supply thing could be a frustration to you"}
{"source": "One final note about Behringer"}
{"source": "they seem to get bad marks now and then"}
{"source": "  I really don't understand why"}
{"source": "  I have two Behringer amps, two of their stomp boxes, the above-mentioned pedal board, and the volume pedal just discussed"}
{"source": "  I really like all of them"}
{"source": "  I have never had any problem with any of these items"}
{"source": "  They perform well, are well made, and certainly, all came at a reasonable price"}
{"source": "  Behringer's full range of products is so extensive, that I see little reason to buy any other brand"}
{"source": "  I'm sticking with them"}
{"source": "Pedal is not working, it just making noise"}
{"source": " Poor quality control"}
{"source": "Actually it looks like used pedal, not like new"}
{"source": "Don't recommend this product"}
{"source": "I share another reviewer's opinion about this pedal not being comfortable at certain treadle angles"}
{"source": "  However, because there is very little output in those lower positions, I don't find it to be an issue"}
{"source": "  In fact I rarely feel the need to use the full travel of the treadle when doing volume swells"}
{"source": "  I thought it a bit strange that this thing specifies a 12 volt AC adapter yet can be powered by a 9 volt battery"}
{"source": "  So"}
{"source": " I decided to see if I would have any issues if I used my One-Spot AC adapter on it - polarity corrected, of course"}
{"source": "  It worked just fine"}
{"source": "  I usually power my looper with the same adapter so I built a splitter cable with labeled, polarity specific terminations and everything worked fine"}
{"source": "  My curiosity didn't end there though"}
{"source": "  I wanted to know if there would be any discernible difference if I used a 12 volt power supply"}
{"source": "  I did it and the only difference I could find was that the power indicator LED was just a wee bit dimmer using the 9 volt adapter"}
{"source": "  There was no change in the sonics whatsoever, nor was there a reduction in output volume that I could hear"}
{"source": "  So what's up with the 12 volt adapter spec, Behringer?  Did you think you could fool all of us out here?  I give it four stars because even though you don't have to use the pedal's full sweep, it just not very comfortable in those lower positions"}
{"source": "  I'll probably get used to it eventually"}
{"source": "I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2"}
{"source": " When I got it, I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal"}
{"source": " As far as a CV controler? it sucks at that too! Why? it squeaks as you move it (after 5 minutes use, right out of the box)"}
{"source": " Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name (although only 'conceived' in Germany)"}
{"source": "It's a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares"}
{"source": " I'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it"}
{"source": "Also, you may say \"who cares if it squeaks a little\"? well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a 'wah' effect at low volume in the studio!Good luck if you buy it"}
{"source": "I have been playing and singing off and on for close to 20 years and currently host an open mic at a local coffee shop"}
{"source": " I have used lots of great equipment and mics including the oft mentioned sm57 and sm58"}
{"source": " While I did not have either one of those to do an a/b comparison - I DID have 2 high-end (over $100 mics) to compare these too"}
{"source": " One was an EV and the other a rather costly older Peavey"}
{"source": " These mics compared favorably to both with a slighter flatter frequency response"}
{"source": " The signal was not quite as hot as the EV and Peavey, but far more resistant to feedback - even when turned up to match the hotter volumes of the other 2"}
{"source": " Can't speak to their longevity or reliability yet, but seems sturdy and a nice performing piece of musical equipment"}
{"source": " I feel that these mics will compare favorably to anything under 150 bucks"}
{"source": " Great value & highly recommended"}
{"source": "love is a perfect microphone for karaoke and mobile DJ live use it to provide live entertainment and I love your reception is perfect and not recommend it"}
{"source": "First of all this is NOT the best microphone ever made"}
{"source": "  But for what they cost they certainly are more than I expected"}
{"source": "  I give it 4 stars as a microphone period, without even taking the low cost into consideration"}
{"source": "  They are so much better than the next cheapest thing that they are worth the extra $5 for sure"}
{"source": " I bought one Behringer XM8500 then two more a couple of months later planning to use them as rehearsal microphones for a geezer band start up about 5 years go"}
{"source": "  However, we actually have used these for vocals at some live performances when the sound tech's personal SM-58's are busy at another job"}
{"source": "  I honestly think we sound about the same either way and maybe a little clearer with the Behringers"}
{"source": "  At one time Alice Cooper and his band were using the Behringer XM8500's, however they may have moved on now for all I know"}
{"source": "These are not Shure SM-58 clones even though they appear to be cosmetic knockoffs"}
{"source": "  They have a slightly hotter output and a more flat response to my ears while the Shure's have a more pronounced lower mid boost that makes the male voice sound bigger and sometimes more distorted if not eq'ed correctly"}
{"source": "  They are an ideal backup vocal microphone since the Behringer behaves like a compromise between a microphone tailored for a male voice and a microphone tailored for a female voice and actually works well without heavy eq"}
{"source": "  It also is if anything more versatile than the SM-58 as it can be useful as an acoustic instrument pickup microphone working for anything that you would ordinarily use an SM-57 to pick up"}
{"source": "  It doesn't overload easily, has a high output and a tight pattern with about the same feedback rejection as the SM-58"}
{"source": "  It has a reasonably decent blast filter, so if using it for outdoor instrument pickup you don't have to add a windscreen"}
{"source": "  Another strength of these is durability"}
{"source": "  My 3 have sustained numerous drops, a couple of falls happened while boom stand mounted so not only did the microphone fall but the weight of the boom stand was behind it adding more mass to the force of the fall"}
{"source": "  No damage at all to any of them!  I used to cringe when they fell or got dropped but now I just shrug"}
{"source": " One weak point about these is they are more sensitive to handling noise, but on the stand handling noise is no issue"}
{"source": "  Mine came in hard plastic foam lined cases with stand adapters"}
{"source": "  The stand adapters are sort of flimsy but usable"}
{"source": " If you want SM-58's you need to buy SM-58's"}
{"source": "  If you want a good all around microphone in the $20 to $40 class then try one of these"}
{"source": "  No on-off switch on these but we do have switches on some of the SM-58's we use and frankly the on-off switch is a liability!  I don't think you can find a better microphone new for the money and recommend them as a decent all-around microphone for the price"}
{"source": "  You can pay more and get less"}
{"source": "Good microphone for the money, sounds a little better than my AKG D88S, knocked it down to 4 stars due to the fact it does not have an on/off switch"}
{"source": " I am a user of Behringer products though, own 2 of their amps"}
{"source": "This is a great quality microphone and at a good price"}
{"source": " Keep it mind it is XLR, for those that haven't noticed"}
{"source": " XLR is a better quality than other connections"}
{"source": " It's the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone (Looking for a good comparison"}
{"source": "), and is MUCH better quality"}
{"source": " It's flawless in quality and doesn't give any feedback"}
{"source": " I would recomment for anyone, especially having such a great price"}
{"source": "I ordered two of them and both arrived within a week"}
{"source": " I tested both of them, they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said (that's why I bought this !!!)"}
{"source": " And they are solidly built too, not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine"}
{"source": "I don't expect to come with it, so no cable is OK for me"}
{"source": "Here is the BUT "}
{"source": " : there is no ON/OFF switch, this really pissed me off"}
{"source": "But this is my fault, I should have read the 1 star review first"}
{"source": "The photo shows no ON/OFF switch, however this does not catch any attention"}
{"source": "And all seller seems to have trouble to say \"this product does not have this, does not have that"}
{"source": "\" It only says what the product does have"}
{"source": "Oh well, I got stuck with two microphones without ON/OFF switch"}
{"source": "I can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone"}
{"source": "wow wow I can't believe it working wonderful"}
{"source": "I'm using it karaoke online in paltalk"}
{"source": "I did compairation with somes I have, it's perfect vocal"}
{"source": "I connected it with mixer Alesis 8 input"}
{"source": "I wish it's built with switch on/offRecomend to buyer"}
{"source": " Thanks Amazon"}
{"source": "I am a professional touring and recording artist, OMEB, who typically sings through a beta 58"}
{"source": " I have recently been very impressed with some of Behringer's products"}
{"source": " Sometimes I will run sound for local festivals and needed a few extra vocal mics"}
{"source": " I had read a few good reviews of this and decided to buy one"}
{"source": " At $25 I figured I could chance it! I used this in place of my beta 58 at a recent show"}
{"source": " The mic was much hotter than the 58, better bass response and the boosted highs in all the right frequencies! As far as durability"}
{"source": " that is the question, but if you are looking for a great mic that doesn't cost $160 bucks"}
{"source": " this is your mic!"}
{"source": "I was expecting a so-so mike for the price, boy was I surprised!  This mike is great"}
{"source": "  One thing I did notice was that if it wasn't fed into a mixer you need some low impedance filters to keep the thing from buzzing, other than that it works great"}
{"source": "This is a high quality microphone"}
{"source": " Sounds really clear and noise is nonexistent"}
{"source": " Works great with my new mixer"}
{"source": " Built very sturdy with metal and not plastic"}
{"source": " Shipping was great along with packaging"}
{"source": " This is a very nice dynamic mic!"}
{"source": "This is a very nice microphone for the money and for general voice over work"}
{"source": "I would not use this mic for professional singing, just spoken word"}
{"source": "I have many microphones, and this compares to the $50"}
{"source": " range mics"}
{"source": "This is a terrific value for anyone who wants something like the Shure SM58 but doesn't want to lay out $100"}
{"source": " I bought it myself as a kind of experiment"}
{"source": " I'm learning blues harp"}
{"source": " I wanted to try out mikes that could be used for a combination of vocals and harmonic playing"}
{"source": " For this reason, the mike had to be one that I could cup in my hands but also mount on a stand"}
{"source": " While my Astatic JT-30 has the great shape and crunchy sound that harp players love, I can't (easily) mount it on a stand and use it for vocals"}
{"source": "The spherical receiver makes the XM8500 pretty easy to cup in my hands"}
{"source": " The torpedo body mounts easily on my OnStage boom mike stand"}
{"source": " And the low-impedance output feeds nicely into my guitar amps with no need for preamping or impedance-matching (and no resulting noise or signal loss)"}
{"source": "The mike isn't perfect, but its low cost and generally excellent construction more than make up for the slight deficiencies"}
{"source": " Here are a couple of more casual notes:1"}
{"source": " The mike in the picture looked bluish to me"}
{"source": " What I actually received was a mike with a very nice black finish"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " The product description seems to report a weight of 8"}
{"source": "5 ounces"}
{"source": " I measured this mike at 10"}
{"source": "3 ounces"}
{"source": " That gives it a substantial feel although the mike is still a bit lighter than similar dynamic mikes that I've used"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " The mike has 500 ohms impedance and a frequency response up to 16,000 Hz"}
{"source": " Bluesmen prefer a cut-off at 10,000 to give a midrange boost, but tweaking can compensate for the extended range on this mike"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " The mike doesn't have an on-off switch, perhaps its  only real deficiency"}
{"source": " These switches really are very handy"}
{"source": "5"}
{"source": " In actual use, the mike dosn't seem very susceptible to pops, and there is no hiss"}
{"source": "6"}
{"source": " The mike comes with a pretty substantial hard-shell carrying case with a molded foam interior that is more than enough protection"}
{"source": " I find a smaller zippered case to be more convenient for pacing this mike in a suitcase, but if you are toting a fair amount of equipment around, or storing this at home, then the oversized case should work well"}
{"source": "I hope this helps"}
{"source": "This is a great microphone"}
{"source": "  It fits easily into all the recording equipment I'm using"}
{"source": "  It has some heft to it so I know it's not going to fall apart and be some wimpy microphone"}
{"source": "  It gives me great sounds"}
{"source": "I've wired and rewired countless guitars and have had a couple fail recently"}
{"source": " Don't know if their QC has gone downhill or what"}
{"source": " I didn't send them back because they're usually around $10 but it's disconcerting when a Fender product unexpectedly fails"}
{"source": " It would have 5 stars but for the recent failures"}
{"source": "this has a good weight, nice connections, and all together fender charm"}
{"source": " pretty decent price compared to GC as well"}
{"source": "First of all, a little Amazon 101 - review the PRODUCT, not the service or the vendor"}
{"source": "  Giving out 1-star ratings because you had a shipping issue or because some third party (like Fender) didn't get you the right model is unfortunate, but it has nothing to do with the product itself"}
{"source": "  All you do is create the impression that this is a poorly-designed product, when exactly the opposite is the case"}
{"source": "I have a Fender 5-way in my loaded pickguard as part of a Squier upgrade"}
{"source": "  Beware that traditional Strats are 1 3/4\" thick, where as many Bullets and Affinity Strats are slightly less than that"}
{"source": "  As such, you might have the bottom of this switch hitting the inside of the guitar"}
{"source": "  You might need to either live with this or shave/sand out a portion of the interior if that's the case"}
{"source": "But the switch itself works great and, really, is quite inexpensive relative to its importance!"}
{"source": "It would be improper for me to claim that these FIT Stratocasters, because I have a Stratocaster remake and I drilled new holes for a Stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in"}
{"source": " What I can say is that the packaging is nice and doesn't seem cheapo (surprised it didn't come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag) the size of the screws was right, the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick, and it came with more than enough to install a Stratocaster pickguard"}
{"source": " I'm sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic Stratocasters anyways"}
{"source": "These screws are not a shiny chrome, so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black Fender Strat body"}
{"source": " They are good quality screws"}
{"source": "They have slightly more of a nickel finish than chrome and look way better, and they give u some spares"}
{"source": "What can I say they are srews and they held my pickgaurd in place"}
{"source": " they fit in the factory hole without a problem"}
{"source": " nothing fancy they just work"}
{"source": "I used this to replace a Pot in my MIM Telecaster"}
{"source": " Works great"}
{"source": " I didn't notice any change in tone"}
{"source": " It just worked like the old one"}
{"source": " But the main this is that it worked"}
{"source": " And my Tele sounds as great as it always did"}
{"source": "I was a little disappointed"}
{"source": "  Don't know if it's a QC problem or if I just got some rejects but out of 6 pots, 1 was out of spec (315k) and 2 were almost out (289k, 205k)"}
{"source": "  1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%"}
{"source": "  They are CTL's so I'm a bit confused"}
{"source": "  Other than that they work fine, they have the nut, washer and cap included (no knob)"}
{"source": "  I will be upgrading the caps"}
{"source": "Hi, I thought these pots would come without the proper caps, it`s not on the description of the product, and they did, so I'm pleased by it, have not installed them yet"}
{"source": " they are CTS brand, it`s hard to read what uF are the caps, I think they are 0"}
{"source": "022uF the standard for Fender guitars"}
{"source": "Ordered 6, and out of 6, I have exactly zero flat washers"}
{"source": " Doesn't match the picture"}
{"source": " Caps are marked 223K, so, looking that up, they are 0"}
{"source": "022uf"}
{"source": " Pot, lockwasher, nut, and cap are what is included"}
{"source": "I used this on my last stratocaster build"}
{"source": " It arrived quickly and was well packaged"}
{"source": " It is black and has a kind of white stripe along the edge, so if you are looking for just a solid black pickguard, be aware"}
{"source": " The cool thing about this pickguard is that it already has aluminum on the back"}
{"source": " I was shielding and star grounding all of my guitars and one of the painful parts was spraying adhesive on the back of pickguards and then putting foil on them and cutting it to fit"}
{"source": " These already come with foil, so there is no need to shield them any more than they already are"}
{"source": "It fit my body perfectly and I am happy with the purchase"}
{"source": "I picked this up because I wanted to change up the looks of my 3-tone sunburst American Standard"}
{"source": " The holes lined up perfectly and it was easy to install but that's what you'd expect since this is a genuine Fender part"}
{"source": " The only concern really is whether or not the color will work on your guitar"}
{"source": " At first, it took some getting used to as it really darkened up the look of my Strat but I like the way it came out with aged white pick up covers and knobs"}
{"source": "Absolutely perfect"}
{"source": " Some other reviewer complained about theirs being blemished, but I'm guessing they just didn;t know to pull off the protective layer"}
{"source": " Mine was shiny-new, and was an absolute perfect fit on my Mexi-Strat"}
{"source": " The price was the best,anywhere,and with free shipping, I couldn't be happier"}
{"source": "Bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat"}
{"source": " Doesn't fit perfect"}
{"source": " Kinda bummed but oh well"}
{"source": "I put this pickguard in a MIM White Blonde Stratocaster, and guitar looks so great"}
{"source": " I didn't need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar"}
{"source": "This is my second Fender Polish Cloth"}
{"source": " They are basic, but that's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I'm done playing"}
{"source": " The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges"}
{"source": " Even though this has happened to me, it didn't keep me from buying the second one"}
{"source": " The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me"}
{"source": " It gets softer with time and use"}
{"source": " Overall I have to say that I'm satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth"}
{"source": "Item arrived as described and on time - Way larger than expected, but my son loved it!  Says it's easier to use than the smaller cloths we've gotten before"}
{"source": "use the cloth often to polish my guitar"}
{"source": " The fender logo makes it look legit"}
{"source": "  Recommended to one and all"}
{"source": "Buttons itself are fine, however when I was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar (right above the thread)"}
{"source": " And I even pre-drill it"}
{"source": " there is no way I can get it out :( so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it (now slightly off-center now)"}
{"source": "They fit fine"}
{"source": " Works as described lol"}
{"source": " Comes with the screws and the &#34;cotton&#34; washers so you dont scratch the body"}
{"source": "Used these while putting together my personal Blues/Classic Rock Frankenstrat"}
{"source": " Replaced everything but the body"}
{"source": " Needed these accessories to match a brand new Fender pick guard"}
{"source": " They worked fine at a great price"}
{"source": "I was happy it was made in the USA but was missing switch tip and had two cracked knobs"}
{"source": " Might have happen in shipping but switch tip wasn't done by shipping"}
{"source": "I have a Fender Stratocaster MIM with standard white pickguard, which I changed by a black one"}
{"source": " Then I decided also change others white pieces, and this Fender Accessory Kit fit perfect in my guitar"}
{"source": " I didn't need no adaptation to install it on guitar"}
{"source": "Kudos to Fender for making an amp like this available at this price point"}
{"source": "  It has 25 watts of power, a 10 inch speaker, a real spring reverb, and it's a traditional analog circuit without a digital processor"}
{"source": "  It will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way it's supposed to"}
{"source": "The downside is that when I compare this amp to what Fender was selling fifteen years ago, the Champion 110, it falls a little short"}
{"source": "  The particle board cabinet is thinner, the speaker is less hefty, and the whole thing feels and sounds a little less substantial"}
{"source": "  It's obvious that the bean counters really pushed to get this thing as inexpensive as it is, and they also moved production to Indonesia from Mexico"}
{"source": "  Maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean"}
{"source": "All the same, I can still recommend it because it beats the crap out of digital amps and it gives you substantial power and a 10\" speaker and real Fender tone and looks"}
{"source": "  Fender probably figures that players flush with cash will prefer a well-made tube amp or an amp with tons of digital modeling, but I kind of wish they still produced a solid 25 watt analog practice/light gigging amp"}
{"source": "i got mine yesterday and love it, it sounds grate ,i didn't know what amp to get, i looked and looked ,read a lot of reviews and even got on YouTube to see what people had to say, and seems this one had a lot of good reviews,, i knew fender has a good name for amps , and for the money this one was the one, i am so glad i got it , it gave life to my electric guitar, i bought mine somewhere else ,but still grate amp ,,i didn't want to spend a lot of money for an amp ,and didn't want to get something small  for 20 or 30 dollars less and would out grow with my music,as i get better playing guitar, but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will"}
{"source": " this will save me money in the long-run ,i am very happy with it,i like the five year warranty that came with it, you can't go wrong ,great sound,, and its not to big ,,nice size amp,,and  easy to pick-up,,nice looking amp ,,"}
{"source": "I was buying a pawn shop guitar, when paying they handed me this amp and stated it came with the guitar"}
{"source": " I didn't expect to actually use it but what the heck, I could sell it and make a bit of money back"}
{"source": " Got home to set up my new pawn shop guitar and plugged into the Frontman 25 just to see if it worked"}
{"source": " I was surprised to find out not only did it work, it sounded very good"}
{"source": " I own a Deluxe Reverb all tube amp and the little Frontman 25 had the Fender sound"}
{"source": " What really was impressive was the reverb, it went from a nice echo to full fledge drippy surf sound"}
{"source": " I actually took it to a few small gigs and it did very well, I normally use a Blues Jr for small gigs but the Frontman did a fine job"}
{"source": " On some smaller gigs when all I need is a little reverb I just plug straight into the amp and it worked well, plenty of volume and smooth reverb plus it's small and easy on the back"}
{"source": " All in all very impressed and have decided to keep it"}
{"source": " I would easily pay full retail, it is a nice little amp, might even see if I can squeeze a 12 inch speaker into it!"}
{"source": "I have several other amps ranging from half stacks to twins and this little guy fills a definite hole"}
{"source": " I mainly play an American Standard Tele and the 25R fits her like a glove"}
{"source": " I love the tone and the reverb for $100 is amazing! The dirty channe is what it is, but the clean channel is worth the price of admission"}
{"source": "I can imagine using this guy for a small gig, but I mainly use it for practice and jamming over night while everyone else is sleeping"}
{"source": " If you are in the market for a sweet little amp with a very rich clean channel and classic spring reverb you should look no further, this really is a great little amp!**Update**If you are interested in a DIY amp stand that will enhance the sound of the amp, check out my review and amp stand plans for the 25R on my website!["}
{"source": "]"}
{"source": "I actually bought this amp at a pawn shop for $60, but i would have paid the retail price if i had bought it new, with no complaints"}
{"source": " For such a small combo, this amp really packs a punch"}
{"source": " It is plenty loud, and is just fine for smaller club gigs"}
{"source": " However, you could use it in larger venues also, since you generally mic up your amp anyway, and get most of your sound from monitors"}
{"source": "Anyway, the clean channel is what you would expect from any Fender amp, with good tone and crisp reverb"}
{"source": " The high gain channel is really fat sounding"}
{"source": " I still use distortion pedals, and generally leave it on the clean channel so i can switch back and forth between clean and distortion with ease (not sure if there is a foot switch for the amp, since my pawn shop purchase didnt include one), but without a pedal, the high gain channel performs adequately"}
{"source": "For the price, this is really an upper echelon amp in my opinion"}
{"source": " Kind of does away with the need for a half stack, unless you are really gigging frequently at larger venues or outdoors"}
{"source": " Plus, it is far lighter and easier to transport, lol"}
{"source": "You get a 10\" speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp; try to findthose two capabilities in another amp for around $90"}
{"source": "00!!!!!!!!!!!!This is by far the best practice amp I have found in the past 10 years and I owna butt load of new amps"}
{"source": "I have actually upgraded to a Champion 40, but still use this amp as much as the 40"}
{"source": "Don't even think about it, this is one of the best (under $100"}
{"source": "00) practice amps, unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp, and in that case you should look elsewhere, as this one is forturning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you havejust lost most of your practice time"}
{"source": "As an addendum, I would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speakeras I have read from other reviewers"}
{"source": " I have a few of these amps, so just for the heck of it,I put in a Celestion G10 Greenback (which costs more than the 25R) and was very disappointed withthe results"}
{"source": "This amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now, but can still be had new for under $100"}
{"source": "00 if you just do an internet search"}
{"source": "Great value and the heavy base easily holds a professional mic or instrument mic"}
{"source": "Great Price! Very Happy and shipped from Amazon perfectly with great packing"}
{"source": "I purchased this desktop stand with the hopes that it would fully support the front weight of a condenser microphone and a shockmount together"}
{"source": "  It does, and it does it well"}
{"source": "  Very solid build, never felt cheap in any way"}
{"source": "  Perfect for its intended use"}
{"source": "  I purchased a second one after using the first for one month"}
{"source": "  Would buy again should the need arise"}
{"source": "I use these in my studio for the two amps and the bass drum"}
{"source": " These are heavy duty and well made"}
{"source": " Really reasonably priced"}
{"source": " I love em!"}
{"source": "I bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well"}
{"source": " For only $12"}
{"source": "00 it is a steal, the stand is extremely sturdy and pretty heavy"}
{"source": " I have used it with multiple mics such as the Audio Technica 2020 with the Samson SP01 shock-mount, a Rode K2, a Studio Projects C1 and a neumann TLM 103"}
{"source": " I have not had any problems and the stand is heavy enough to use with basically any mic"}
{"source": " I was not going to write a review for this product but I came across another review that stated \"I purchased this stand as people had reviewed this to work with a AT2020 with a SP01 shockmount"}
{"source": " Mine must have been missing a part as it does not connect no matter what I try"}
{"source": " \" THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE"}
{"source": " The Samson SP01 shock-mount works perfectly with this stand ( as any shock-mount or mic would, since the threading is a standard size)"}
{"source": " I just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion"}
{"source": " Also almost every shock-mount has an adapter in the mount ( where the shock-mount connects to the mic stand) that is slightly smaller than most US mic stands, BUT THIS COMES OUT!! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TAKE A COIN AND UNSCREW IT FROM THE SHOCK-MOUNT"}
{"source": " After the adapter is out the Samson SP01 will connect to this stand"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this product"}
{"source": "Use this for my desk mic at home"}
{"source": " It hold my mic right where I want it and doesn't move from where I place it"}
{"source": " Worth every penny and then some"}
{"source": "Not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand"}
{"source": " Solid heavy base"}
{"source": " Well built"}
{"source": " Does the job of holding a mic"}
{"source": " No more, no less"}
{"source": "These strings sound great on an acoustic when properly tuned, I bought these at a local shop after looking at a different brand"}
{"source": " The owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup"}
{"source": " I like the lighter sounds out of them, and using a capo makes them sound great also"}
{"source": " These seem significantly brighter and more dynamic than my previous set of Ernie Ball strings and I am planning on trying them out on another guitar soon"}
{"source": "They seem to stay in tune more than other strings and also take to bending well"}
{"source": " I use them on an electric acoustic and I am happy with the sound when i play through an amp"}
{"source": "For the price of these strings, you can't go wrong"}
{"source": " However, compared to Elixers, the sound just isn't as &#34;full"}
{"source": "&#34;"}
{"source": "Good Strings, I buy this Strings from a few years and i love them, I like them with my Gibson LP, but also with my other guitar with the Floyd!, They are durable, and a really good sound for my Funky Rock Type of music i like!"}
{"source": "I like Ernie Ball strings"}
{"source": " They are less expensive and seem to retain their integrity longer than the other brands I tried"}
{"source": " I change strings every two weeks"}
{"source": " I tried the rest and returned to the best"}
{"source": "I purchased a 12 for the price of 10 pack of these from Musician's Friend"}
{"source": " I've used Elixirs for years and decided to try regular strings again"}
{"source": " This 12 pack was about the same price as 2-3 packs of Elixirs"}
{"source": " So far I am very happy with these strings"}
{"source": " They sound and feel great"}
{"source": "These strings are good, especially for the price"}
{"source": " I have found better strings through D'Addario however, and the feel of them is  superior to these in my opinion"}
{"source": "these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings"}
{"source": " these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch, Ernie Ball strings are garbage, the only time I will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, Touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh,  you can spend 4$ for a set of Ernie Ball or D'Addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of DR strings and change them once a month, or you can spend 10$ for a set of Elixir Polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months,  It doesn't make sense to use these crappy Ernie's unless you are sponsored by EB and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars,"}
{"source": "These are my favorite strings for electric guitar"}
{"source": " I've been using them since I started playing about eighteen years ago"}
{"source": " I've tried other strings, like Gibson and D'Addario, but I like the sound and feel of Ernie Balls the best -- they feel nice, full, thick, hefty"}
{"source": " I play blues, jazz, and bluesy rock"}
{"source": " I use these on a Gibson Les Paul Vintage Mahogany and a Yamaha neck-thru-body electric, and they are good for the music I play and for providing a full-bodied sound"}
{"source": " There are a whole host of \"big name\" guitarists who use these strings, and for good reason"}
{"source": " I buy them in 10 packs to save money -- can't seem to find that option here on Amazon"}
{"source": "Been using this brand of strings since 1971,I've always been pleased"}
{"source": " I like the super slinks as well"}
{"source": " Love um"}
{"source": "This was a much needed purchase because my son being a new musician is going through the guitar strings"}
{"source": "  He found just what he needed and at a great price"}
{"source": "These have always been my favorite strings, and I've just about tried them all"}
{"source": " Everything from elixirs, fenders, gibson, dunlop, and everything in between; I always end up coming back to ernie ball one way or another"}
{"source": " Whether it be regular slinky or my ambitious not even slinky *they are a set of 12s* Overall great strings, never had a break on me, last long, sound pretty good too"}
{"source": "heard they were nice strings"}
{"source": "they do make better"}
{"source": "but just starting to play and dont have need for new strings just yet"}
{"source": "A great deal on what I consider the best all purpose guitar strings out there"}
{"source": " Do the big names in the music biz use Ernie Ball strings? Yes, and for good reason"}
{"source": " While it is true that you can attain a fatter sound with the heavier gauge variety, I have found that for my USA Stratocaster, that the ease of play with the &#34;9&#34; strings is the clincher -- and they provide an amazingly full sound, with no stress on the fingers at all"}
{"source": "I bought these hoping they would allow me to learn to bend guitar strings blues style"}
{"source": "  They turned out to be just right"}
{"source": "  I don't play that often but they have lasted for a lot longer than expected"}
{"source": "  very pleased with the product and price"}
{"source": "I have a 5 watt combo amp"}
{"source": "  I was looking for a smoother sound, and got it in this tube"}
{"source": "  It lacks the brutal attack of the Sovtek and the all around bright articulate response of the NOS RCA gray plate I tried for over a year, but I'm really liking this sound for what it is"}
{"source": "  I think a tube amp ought to be warm and musical, with nice natural compression, and that's what I'm getting out of this JJ"}
{"source": "I bought these when I had to re-tube my Marshall JCM800 2203KK head"}
{"source": " This is the only tube head I have played or had so I really cant tell you how they compare to other brands but these things rock"}
{"source": " They are very good for metal/hard rock and have lasted a year now, while gigging and practicing weekly"}
{"source": " I was recommended to JJ by a friend who only uses them and I will likely be doing the same"}
{"source": " I paired them with the JJ KT88s and these things just rock"}
{"source": "I own a Fender '65 Reverb Reissue, and I had learned from many guitar gurus and such that the best tubes that sound amazing are very, very difficult to find"}
{"source": " However, I bought this JJ Electronics one expecting something decent to tide me through until I had enough money to afford a higher-end tube, and this blew me away"}
{"source": " I was surprised at how good the tone of the amp was and how it made my guitar sound"}
{"source": "This was well worth the small amount of money that I paid for it"}
{"source": " In fact, I think I will just go ahead and keep using this permanently until it's almost dead before I purchase another tube"}
{"source": "These tubes just aren't for me"}
{"source": " They don't sound great"}
{"source": "kind of flat and lifeless"}
{"source": " Also unreliable"}
{"source": " One (out of 7) arrived DOA and another has failed since"}
{"source": "Needed a pre amp tube for my Hartke LH500 and ordered one of these"}
{"source": "while waiting ended up buying and using a 12AX7 Groove Tube so this one still sits in my gear bag, waiting to be powered up"}
{"source": " If that time comes Im sure this will be a great tube"}
{"source": "I like the tone of this one better than the stock one in my Champ and in my Kustom Kontender"}
{"source": " Also, I like it more than the JJ, but the difference is subtle"}
{"source": " The JJ version seems to be a bit brighter and slightly more noise (in a good way, but not what I want for me)"}
{"source": "Like the previous reviewer, I bought this to switch out the stock one that came in my mic preamp, and it just did wonders to warm the sound"}
{"source": " Only problem is, now I am eyeing my amp, all it's tubes, and thinking"}
{"source": " if one little adjustment made such a difference in a pre-amp, imagine what some of these will do in my fender! Sigh! Always something!Anyway, this is great! I am sure I will get more!"}
{"source": "I bought this and am very satisfied with the quality and construction"}
{"source": " One of the features I like is that it just doesn't take up too much room, and can be placed in its carrying bag which makes it wasy to store"}
{"source": "Over all a nice easy to use poratble music stand"}
{"source": "The music stand is perfect for the keyboard I am playing"}
{"source": "  It is strong, height flexible and hold the music sheets firmly"}
{"source": "Amazingly sturdy for the $"}
{"source": "  It isn't as sturdy as some, but it probably is the sturdiest of the truly collapsible stands"}
{"source": "  It folds up very nicely"}
{"source": "  I'd buy it again"}
{"source": "This little music stand folds up small enough (after some disassembly) to fit in a pouch less than 2 feet tall and 2 inches wide"}
{"source": " Once assembled, it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books"}
{"source": " The height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you're standing, seated on a stool or in a chair"}
{"source": " The angle of the tray is not adjustable"}
{"source": " The legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it, so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location"}
{"source": " But for a portable stand, it's hard to find fault with this one, especially given the low cost"}
{"source": "This stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging"}
{"source": " If you need a boom, simply add anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Blackand you're good to go"}
{"source": "In addition to being indestructible, this stand takes up far less stage (or studio) real estate than a tripod type stand like theOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand"}
{"source": " And despite the relatively small size of the base, it is far more stable than the tripod stands"}
{"source": " Admittedly, this stand is a great deal heavier, so if weight is an issue you may not like this type"}
{"source": "Even with a boom fully extended I have found this stand to be stable"}
{"source": " For outside use in fair breezes this stand remains upright, which is not always the case with the tripod types"}
{"source": " Moreover, there are no legs to break (I have lost one tripod stand to that problem"}
{"source": ")If you transport your gear often, and especially if you play outside (or inside on cramped stages) this stand is the best choice in my opinion"}
{"source": "The Rat has been used by everyone from David Gilmour to Dave Grohl to give you a grasp of its range"}
{"source": "  It does everything from light crunch, to Marshall-style thick rhythms, to all out face-melting distortion"}
{"source": "Rich harmonics, near infinite sustain, and a mid-range push that will cut through a mix like no other distortion pedal"}
{"source": "This pedal has not left my board since the day I bought it"}
{"source": "  The fact that it's built like a tank ensures it's going to be around a long time after my playing days are over"}
{"source": "There a hundreds of distortion pedals on the market today"}
{"source": " Sure, some are said to be the best at this or that, but for me the RAT is the one that does it all"}
{"source": " And at a great price to boot"}
{"source": " This pedal is not new to me"}
{"source": " I've had a few of them in the past, but the RAT 2 is just a great as the older \"vintage\" models"}
{"source": " Goes from a nice bit of drive that is far better than a Tube Screamer, to a near fuzztone, with some warm, smooth creamy tones in between"}
{"source": " Remarkable"}
{"source": " No other distortion pedal can do it as well"}
{"source": " I've been playing for 5 decades and have had more than my share of them"}
{"source": " But the RAT delivers"}
{"source": " No joke"}
{"source": " It just does it all, and well"}
{"source": "The Filter (tone) is set up where the tone gets deeper by going clockwise rather than counter clockwise"}
{"source": " That might thow a few folks off, but it's a little thing really"}
{"source": " The Filter is the core of it's tone and the Distortion control is very linear in how it increases the distortion"}
{"source": " By going higher with the Distortion control, the volume only goes up a little"}
{"source": " That's great as making changes while playing is less of a hastle if you just lean over and bump it up a bit, the volume won't go through the roof"}
{"source": "100% silent switching"}
{"source": " No hum"}
{"source": " No buzz"}
{"source": " And no loss or increase of your overall level when you engage the unit"}
{"source": " Flawless comes to mind here"}
{"source": " Easy to set up"}
{"source": " Strong as a Tiger tank"}
{"source": " And just flat out gives you what you want without all the fuss of 6 or 8 knobs for you to mess with"}
{"source": " And the three that are there all glow in the dark like all the RATs of the past"}
{"source": " Kinda cool if you ask me"}
{"source": "If one wants a good distortion pedal that will perform without issues, get yourself a RAT"}
{"source": " If you want to impress your friends with how much money you dumped on a \"boo-teek\" pedal that sits in the RAT's shadow, buy that high dollar unit and you can at least \"Look Good\" while you play"}
{"source": " But your tone will still stink"}
{"source": " Its up to you"}
{"source": " Me? Its a no brainer"}
{"source": " I go with the RAT"}
{"source": "This pedal is exactly what I have been looking for since three years ago when I started performing"}
{"source": " The distortion on this is deep, has long sustain, and has a nice tone to it that the classic Boss DS-1 pedal does not have"}
{"source": " It's perfect for a great sound, from heavy rhythm guitar chugging to fat, bruising solos"}
{"source": "I love this pedal and have been using constantly ever since I got it"}
{"source": "However, word of fair warning: the pedal itself uses a +9V power charge rather than the typical guitar f/x pedal -9V (barrel jack"}
{"source": " Look at the power supply of a Boss pedal to see what I am talking about"}
{"source": " This ProCo RAT Pedal does NOT use that)"}
{"source": " If you buy this pedal, you will have to do one of four things:1) Buy the power supply made specifically for this pedal"}
{"source": "2) Consistently use and replace batteries"}
{"source": "3) Find a converter from barrel jack to 3"}
{"source": "5mm jack"}
{"source": "4) Be an electrical engineer and rewire it yourself"}
{"source": "Other than the above, excellent pedal!"}
{"source": "I've owned over 3 dozen dirt boxes over the years, and I just love the Rat"}
{"source": "  It makes my tube halfstack sing, and my practice amp sound like a big amp"}
{"source": "Its great as a stand alone distortion, running on a clean amp"}
{"source": "  It can get everything from that perfect bluesy grit to roaring sludge (just max out the distortion and use your neck pickup on an LP to sound EXACTLY like King Buzzo of the Melvins) and everything inbetween"}
{"source": "It can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory"}
{"source": "  Case in point, my buddy has an old Peavy stack from the 70's in his garage"}
{"source": "  Its a solid state head on top of a vertical cab of two 14\" speakers"}
{"source": "  On its own, you can use the gain and distortion knobs present on the amp to get a decent sound, but with his Les Paul it still sounded oddly dark"}
{"source": "  We put the Rat in front of it and with some fiddling got that perfect AC/DC style overdrive out of it"}
{"source": "I think the main reason I love the Rat so much is not only the great tone and its sheer indestructability, but the filter knob"}
{"source": "  Normal tone knobs allow you to focus more on bass or treble, but usually if you boost one, you cut the other"}
{"source": "  The filter is more of a high end roll off, you can darken or brighten your tone accordingly, but when you DO go brighter, you still have the same bottom end"}
{"source": "  It doesn't CUT the bass out"}
{"source": "  So even with a more treble heavy sound, you still have a fuller rounder tone, it doesn't thin out so much"}
{"source": "Its really an excellent pedal"}
{"source": "  I've heard that some claim you have to get an older one with the LM308 chip to really get \"the sound\" but that's a myth"}
{"source": "  Look on a few guitar forums or on youtube for plenty of tests and testimony showing the fact that the new ones do indeed sound the same as the old ones"}
{"source": "  A Rat is a Rat, whether they're coming from China or the USA"}
{"source": "p"}
{"source": "s"}
{"source": "  Mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark"}
{"source": "  So I dunno what that other guy was complaining about"}
{"source": "As far as tried and true distortion pedals go, this is really just average"}
{"source": " The filter doesnt have enough of an impact on the pedal to provide a truly large range from fuzz to metal distortion"}
{"source": " Compared to other distortion pedals, it really fails in this regard"}
{"source": " However, if used as a fuzz pedal instead, it truly shines, since this is really what it is"}
{"source": " Does it have distortion? Yes"}
{"source": " Is it valuable as such? Not in my opinion"}
{"source": " It isnt condensed enough to be used strictly as that"}
{"source": " Another gripe I have is the 9 volt slot"}
{"source": " Most pedals use a universal design which allows you to use almost any power supply"}
{"source": " Not so with this pedal"}
{"source": " You are pretty much relegated to their own adapter or batteries, which sux IMO, especially since I run all my pedals off an adapter chain"}
{"source": "Anyways, while this is fun to play with, you should definitely consider the sound you are going for"}
{"source": " If you prefer to play a more grungy or 70's era metal, then this will work for you"}
{"source": " For more crisp sound, you should look elsewhere"}
{"source": " IMO"}
{"source": "This holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy"}
{"source": " It has a little sticky tab on the back so you can stick it to something (such at the side of back of your instrument) so you always know where your picks are and always have them on hand"}
{"source": " I don't know exactly how many it holds, and the thickness of the picks makes a difference, but I've crammed quite a few of varying sizes in here without issues"}
{"source": "I used to be that guy that lost about 30 guitar picks a month"}
{"source": " I bought three of these Dunlop Pick Holders, one for each of the three gauges I find myself constantly using, and they've more than paid for themselves in the short time I've had them"}
{"source": "Have not had the chance to stick it to my guitar"}
{"source": " So it is just used as a pick holder so my picks have some places to go"}
{"source": " Can hold up to 11 picks of "}
{"source": "50 thickness"}
{"source": " I use Tortex Guitar Pick of that thickness"}
{"source": "It is OK, but it does not compare to the ergo holder"}
{"source": "Which you may find here:Dunlop Ergo Pickholder"}
{"source": "The main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out, and it is extremely fragile"}
{"source": "This is a great little addition to my guitar because otherwise picks end up getting lost everywhere"}
{"source": "  One note: this does NOT come with any picks"}
{"source": "  One customer said it did, but mine did not"}
{"source": "  It has a sticky pad on the back, and sticks well to a wood guitar"}
{"source": "  I even moved it once, and it still sticks fine"}
{"source": "  It is spring loaded so that the top pick easily slides out"}
{"source": "Has a double stick tape so you can place it in a handy place"}
{"source": " Easy to reach and nice to have on hand"}
{"source": "I bought one of these for a friend of mine, and he said it was the best thing he'd ever used to keep his picks out where he can readily get to them"}
{"source": " I bought two more today"}
{"source": "I lose picks so easily I needed a pick hold"}
{"source": "  This one sticks well to the guitar"}
{"source": "  Locating a spot for it depends on you and your guitar"}
{"source": "  Unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle"}
{"source": " So I push one or two extra picks partly in the holder to stop it"}
{"source": "  I might try it somewhere on the strap"}
{"source": "I bought this for my 11 year old daughter to help her keep up with her picks"}
{"source": "  She loves it and is doing much better with not losing pics"}
{"source": "  I stuck this on her amp so she would not mis-place it"}
{"source": "Fulfils it's intended purpose"}
{"source": "Holds several picks"}
{"source": "non-marring adhesive on back won't damage guitar finishes"}
{"source": "Easy to withdraw and replace picks"}
{"source": "I have one of these on my guitar and one on my ukulele"}
{"source": " I can't imagine life without this pick holder -- before I was always losing picks and then I had to strum with my fingers which I don't like doing"}
{"source": " Get one of these if you play with a pick!"}
{"source": "I always have problem finding pick when I need them, and this product helps me solve the issue"}
{"source": " It is easy to use"}
{"source": "This is the best cleaning product I've ever used"}
{"source": " Not only do I use it on my maple and rosewood fretboards, but I also use it on the headstock if it's unfinished and on the unfinished body of my Ukulele"}
{"source": " What it does is it restores the wood in a way that it gives it a much more brilliant, beautiful and lively tone"}
{"source": " Really brings out the beauty of true wood"}
{"source": " Now every fretboard and unfinished bit of wood on my guitars looks beautiful and brand new"}
{"source": " Application method is also very useful"}
{"source": " I don't know why there is a strict warning saying not to use it on maple fretboards; I put it on my Stratocaster's maple fretboard and it looks beautiful"}
{"source": " The only thing it did differently was it made the fretboard a good shade darker"}
{"source": " I also must add that the stuff has a very wonderful lemony smell (nowhere near overpowering), and it does clean off a lot of dirt in conjunction to hydrating and livening the wood"}
{"source": " Great stuff"}
{"source": " Go ahead and buy it"}
{"source": "So far still Made in America"}
{"source": " I have been using formula 65 guitar polish for over 40 years since a time when my hair was longer as a hippie growing up with heavy metal"}
{"source": " I've polished many guitars multiple times"}
{"source": " This gets the grime and fingerprints off the body and neck keeping the instrument looking like new"}
{"source": " It works great on acoustic and electric, solid or hollow body, acrylic or lacquer finishes without streaking"}
{"source": " It even cleans Finger Ease lubricants off the neck and strings"}
{"source": " I haven't needed other products separately for the neck or strings since this works great on both"}
{"source": "I'd say if you own a guitar with a rosewood fretboard, this should be a mandatory purchase for your prized possession"}
{"source": " Just one bottle of this should last years and years"}
{"source": " I also like the fact it utilizes a dabber to prevent spills and accidents"}
{"source": " I used this the other night to &#34;feed&#34; the rosewood on my Telecaster, and this difference was night and day"}
{"source": "I was hoping the Lemon oil would be what I needed to get that crud off some of my guitar fingerboards but, it's not very good at that"}
{"source": " I suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry"}
{"source": " Once clean, the lemon oil does a good job of sealing the wood - even where years of playing have taken their toll"}
{"source": " It's a good finish but, not the place to start"}
{"source": " The product is not meant to be used on maple"}
{"source": " Don't know why but, not an issue since most of my instruments are rosewood or other dark, exotic woods"}
{"source": " So far, so good"}
{"source": "Restored my rosewood fingerboard with a great color! Also works well on the bridge and only used a fraction of the bottle"}
{"source": " A great investment that'll last quite a long time"}
{"source": "It's oil"}
{"source": "what more do you want?Turn upside down, squeeze hard, use your &#34;man&#34; level strength and soon the tip will darken, apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion"}
{"source": " IMMEDIATELY wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away"}

{"source": "It's okay to soak the wood as long as it's momentary"}

{"source": " Not a good situation"}
{"source": "Lemon oil isn't like other oils, it isn't very slippery and kind of makes things grabby"}
{"source": " It's oil but it actually works more like a solvent, cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean"}
{"source": "like your frets"}
{"source": "hint hint"}
{"source": "Just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re-string and you'll be a happy camper"}
{"source": "I love this stuff"}
{"source": " I've tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best"}
{"source": " And in case you are wondering, it comes with a cloth cap attached to the bottle under the twist off cap so all you have to do is turn the bottle upside down and clean away"}
{"source": " You may need an additional cloth in the beginning to wipe off the excess liquid because the bottle is full when you first get it (of course)"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this product"}
{"source": "This will make your fretboard smile!  It takes a dry, faded, fretboard and makes it look like new"}
{"source": "  A few dabs goes a long way so this 4 ounce bottle should last you a long time"}
{"source": "  If your fretboard is really dry & faded, apply heavily and allow it soak in"}
{"source": "  Continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry"}
{"source": "  I was amazed at how this made a dull & faded 40 year old Fender fretboard came back to life"}
{"source": "I love this stuff for all my fretboards, except for unusually dirty ones"}
{"source": "  If it is super grundgy, clean it with something stronger, than follow-up with this stuff"}
{"source": "  Leaves the wood nourished and new looking without any greasy feel"}
{"source": "  I usually apply it twice in a row and wipe clean each time"}
{"source": "This is a lemon oil used for cleaning and conditioning the rosewood fingerboards of guitars"}
{"source": " This only gets done once a year on the average guitar, so if you're like me, this one bottle will supply you for many lifetimes"}
{"source": " Other than that, it is what it is and does what it says"}
{"source": " The applicator contains a dispensing valve so push down hard to open it when you want the oil to flow"}
{"source": "The label says NOT to use this product on maple fingerboards"}
{"source": " Doesn't say why, but my guess is it will discolor them, so be forewarned"}
{"source": "not bad, if you dont use any batteryand use a 9vdc adapter thingie"}
{"source": "make sure thingie outputs at least500 mA if you can "}
{"source": "tried mic, bass, and electric guitar and keyboardsthru this thing"}
{"source": "all workand the distortion control"}
{"source": " mostlly notnecessary for me, but others will find thatcontrol  is use ful too"}
{"source": "it is a cutie and works for fun,and u might get loudness around 90 dBA onsome frequencies"}
{"source": "  not bad at all"}
{"source": "even got a headphone connect on it forlate nite playing"}
{"source": "a good thing"}
{"source": " for the price it is worth"}
{"source": "I play bass in a lot of different environments, and I never know what to expect before I show up"}
{"source": " If I am playing a venue where I can use my head and 4x12 combo I know I'll have great tone"}
{"source": " If I am going direct into the board I am at the mercy of the house equipment and engineer"}
{"source": " This unit gives me ;the ability to still go direct, but allows me to tweak the signal for maximum warmth"}
{"source": " I suppose you could look at this like an effects stomp box but it is really so much more"}
{"source": " if you play at church and are tired of hearing the life sucked out of your bass you should give this a try"}
{"source": " I love it"}
{"source": "DI bass is the worst"}
{"source": " Just really, really awful"}
{"source": " Every ordinary DI box I've tried yields this thin, cheap treble sound that does not present my bass in its most flattering light"}
{"source": " So when I started playing live weekly, I just hauled my bass amp around to each gig, because it was out of the question that I would rely on a weird sounding DI box to carry the day"}
{"source": "I live in Phoenix"}
{"source": " I made it through about two months of lugging a monstrous bass amp across town in 115 degree weather before I decided there had to be another way"}
{"source": "When I first got this pedal, I would run it parallel with the amp, terrified to rely entirely on this little box for my sound"}
{"source": " After a few performances, I let go and left the amp at home"}
{"source": " The Bass Attack pedal did not disappoint"}
{"source": " Ever since, I just bring a bass and this pedal"}
{"source": " Running straight into the board through this thing delivers a magnificently huge bass sound"}
{"source": " I don't miss the amp at all"}
{"source": "I did spend an entire evening the night this pedal arrived, just tweaking knobs until it was perfect"}
{"source": " You'll want to dial in exactly the right sound for your bass, and some of the settings I tried were less than ideal for my instrument"}
{"source": " But once I got it locked in, I've never touched the knobs again"}
{"source": " I just plug in and everything sounds magical"}
{"source": "I'm using this as a DI box for recording"}
{"source": " It does some compression, overdrive, EQ'ing, notch EQ'ing, and excite-ing all in one pedal"}
{"source": " So compared to the original bass signal, you get this clear, deep, punchy sound that fits right into a mix"}
{"source": "The Bass Attack sounds a lot like a SansAmp Bass Driver but at 1/3 the price"}
{"source": " One difference is that it has an additional \"Shape\" knob, which is a lot like the ISF knob on Blackstar products, and is a notch filter"}
{"source": " The other difference is that the SansAmp uses tougher chassis and components, so would last longer for the gigging musician"}
{"source": " But don't take me wrong, the Bass Attack uses a solid metal chassis and doesn't feel cheap at all"}
{"source": "The Harmonics knob adds some overdrive, and gets kind of farty when turned up 100% but sounds pretty good at 75-90%"}
{"source": " It doesn't do that high gain super gritty/fizzy distortion though, for that you could connect a distortion pedal to the parallel output, or duplicate the track in your DAW and add a distortion plugin"}
{"source": "This pedal is very versatile"}
{"source": " I found that the Shape knob is indispensable; it takes the place of a mid control"}
{"source": " For example, by notching (reducing) the boomy 60-130 Hz region and turning up the level, you get plenty more mids"}
{"source": " The treble and bright control seem very similar to each other, one seems to amplify the 4k region, the other the 5k but that's just an estimate"}
{"source": " By keeping both of those around 10 o'clock and the Shape control beneath 115 Hz, I can get a solid, deep, yet mid-full sound for a metal mix"}
{"source": " Thus anyone who thinks this pedal is all bass and treble and no mids, ought to try settings along those lines"}
{"source": "Another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48V phantom power"}
{"source": " As in, no adapter or battery needed when recording direct or running to a mixer"}
{"source": " In conclusion, for recording, you can duplicate the SansAmp sound that you hear on a lot of albums using the Bass Attack, and tweak it further via the Shape control"}
{"source": " And yes, the various button pushes get you four different sounds total, but I prefer having both buttons on"}
{"source": " Then in my DAW I only throw on an extra compressor and it sounds great"}
{"source": " This pedal is a steal for no frills bass DI recording"}
{"source": "I have used Ernie Ball strings on my Les Paul for quite a while, Slinkys mostly"}
{"source": "  I recently bought a Yamaha FG700S and quickly found that the high E string had a very \"tinny\" tone"}
{"source": "  I searched the net to see if this was comon with this model, alas I found that it is"}
{"source": "So I decided to try some different strings to see if it would help"}
{"source": "  I ordered a set of Earthwood Lights and installed them last night"}
{"source": "Wow, what a difference"}
{"source": "  First the tone is much softer on the E string, second the action feels much more comfortable on strings 1 thru 3"}
{"source": "  The strings that came on the guitar were Yamaha light strings but they were very stiff, especially the B string"}
{"source": "  After a hour of playing with the Earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable, both tonally and physically"}
{"source": "  Not sure how they will last, time will tell"}
{"source": "Good strings I would recommend them"}
{"source": "Great strings"}
{"source": " They last longer than some of the others and easy to re-string the guitarother brands do not seem to stand up to Ernie Balls"}
{"source": "At one point I had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat, but then I smartened up, worked my calluses to the point where I could probably play 13-62's tuned to E with no trouble, and realized that these strings worked great for my strat, because of the strong tone that these provide, and ease of bending on the upper frets"}
{"source": " These strings also are good for Les Pauls, where the scale length is shorter than the Fender guitars, making bending like velvet"}
{"source": "They were a little too much for the Squier Bullet I put them on, even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neck"}
{"source": "While I had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness"}
{"source": " More metal moving over a guitar pickup = hotter sound, more gain, and on a Stratocaster more glass and bell like tones"}
{"source": "I've used Ernie Ball's Slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades"}
{"source": " They never break, they stay in tune after stretching, and they sound great"}
{"source": " Lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound"}
{"source": "Fun fact: Get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery"}
{"source": " There is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound RINGing out of your amplifier"}

{"source": " :)"}
{"source": "After using D'Addario strings I've try to Ernie Ball strings"}
{"source": " I have ten years ago with Ernie Ball strings and let me tell you that it's the best strings"}
{"source": " In comparison with Regular Slinky, this strings have a little heavy powerfull sound for funk, clasical rock and indie sound"}
{"source": " I have an Stratocaster and let me tell you that sound balance being hybrid gives much versatility to play different genres"}
{"source": "Monster Standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price"}
{"source": " It's flexible (unlike some of their more expensive cable), quiet, solid, and durable"}
{"source": " It's much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables"}
{"source": " For the money, it's really hard to beat"}
{"source": " I won't waste money on the more expensive cables again"}
{"source": "I'm a keyboard player, and in the past I had been spending $40-$60 for Monster's \"delegated\" keyboard cables"}
{"source": "  But suddenly one shorted out on me after only several months use, causing me to question the \"Monster mystique"}
{"source": "\"  I began to compare the Monster keyboard cables with cheap, \"off-brand\" guitar cables and couldn't hear any difference"}
{"source": "  No question it's a well-made, trustworthy (but not indestructible or infallible) cable, but I'm no longer committed to it at any price"}
{"source": "  However, at Amazon's current \"value\" price for this particular Monster cable, it's a no-brainer"}
{"source": "  Moreover, I no longer have hesitations about purchasing a cable that doesn't say \"piano\" or \"keyboard\" on it"}
{"source": "  (One of my Monster keyboard cables even came with one end designated for the amp and the other for the instrument--but it was hard to see which was which in a dimly lit club"}

{"source": "  If you're plugging into a board or P"}
{"source": "A"}

{"source": "I prefer Shar's Overture premieres which are the same price"}
{"source": "  These ones are a little too &#34;bright&#34; in sound and not deep or resonant enough"}
{"source": "  Also bear in mind these are not dominants which are clearly far superior - but for which you would be paying $50 a set"}
{"source": "Saves your thumb on the strum;grips nicely in your fingers but not on the strings;A Totem of Rock and Roll in your grip"}
{"source": "Playing an acoustic ukulele with all nylon strings, I've preferred just to strum using my fingers because \"traditional\" plastic picks are just too harsh and loud"}
{"source": "  Even felt picks are too harsh (not to mention the dust/shedding they do)"}
{"source": "The Wedgie is EXACTLY what I've been looking for"}
{"source": " Harder than my thumb, softer than plastic or felt, the 3"}
{"source": "1mm Hard Rubber Wedgie is the Goldilocks pick; right in the butter zone"}
{"source": "I tried the \"Soft\" and \"Medium\" Wedgies, but both were just too soft"}
{"source": "  The Soft Wedgie over-grabs the strings and winds up dragging and producing a dull tone"}
{"source": "  The Medium is better, but is still too dull and the action is a bit too soft"}
{"source": "But the Hard Wedgie is the clear winner"}
{"source": "  I get great volume and tone without the harsh twang of plastic on nylon strings"}
{"source": "The only negatives I've found are:1"}
{"source": " They can leave skid marks on your pick guard"}
{"source": "  No big deal, as it wipes right off"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " They break down faster than I'd like"}
{"source": "  Of course, that could just be my expectations"}
{"source": "Still, if you're looking a softer-than-plastic pick, this is the one to get"}
{"source": " No pick noise, just strings"}
{"source": " I couldn't be happier"}
{"source": "I bought one of each Soft, Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the Hard is as soft as the Soft"}
{"source": " They felt exactly the same in fact"}
{"source": " The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch"}
{"source": "Packaging error? I have no idea"}
{"source": " The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing"}
{"source": " So check with what you get"}
{"source": "Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted"}
{"source": "There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming"}
{"source": "The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead"}
{"source": "I've tried all 3 types of these, and they're pretty much as-advertised"}
{"source": "  I don't really find a huge difference in tone between the relative hardnesses of the rubber, but it is there to a small degree"}
{"source": "  To me these are too dull sounding for an acoustic"}
{"source": "  Well, they don't sound bad, but if you then switch to a normal pick you'll notice the upper and upper-mid harmonics that are being de-emphasized by the duller attack"}
{"source": "  It doesn't sound bad, and in certain applications it would be fine"}
{"source": " I wouldn't want it to be my everyday acoustic tone, though"}
{"source": "THey fare much better with electric guitar, where the difference in attack can be less notable, but you'll still notice the loss of some \"sparkle\""}
{"source": "  But for the most part I found the sound very agreeable and useable"}
{"source": "  The pick tends to catch on the strings a bit - there's more friction, of course - but it's just something to get used to"}
{"source": "The bottom line:  I like these, and they'll probably last me almost forever, but I don't really see them becoming my go-to picks"}
{"source": "  I like the thickness and the feel (they won't slip out of your hand while playing) but the loss in high end is just enough that I don't think I want to limit myself in that way, except for certain situations"}
{"source": "  I tend to switch back and forth between a pick and fingers anyway, so I already get a sound similar to this by using my fingers"}
{"source": "  Worth a try, though, and you just might find a keeper if you need to tame an amp or guitar that's just a bit too bright"}
{"source": "  You know, at higher volumes, too, it's easy for the high frequencies to be emphasized, and these might work better in a live setting where you've got your amp cranked up"}
{"source": "I usually just use my fingers to strum my tenor uke, but there are songs where a pick is more appropriate"}
{"source": " I used to have an old felt pick made back in the 1940s, but it disintegrated over time and the newer felt picks I've found just don't feel the same"}
{"source": "I bought a set of soft, medium and hard Wedgie picks to try out and I'm really happy with the results"}
{"source": " I greatly prefer the soft Wedgie on the Uke, I like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard Wedgie's really nice for my Jazz Bass"}
{"source": " I still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars, but the Wedgie's are fantastic for when I need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments"}
{"source": "I'd love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday, but it still works very well for me"}
{"source": "This is a great pick for all those that use picks, but need a softer sound occasionally"}
{"source": "  Much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up"}
{"source": "  The only negative is the way they seem to be packed here"}
{"source": "  They come in three colors and the colors stand for soft, medium, hard"}
{"source": "  They also come in 3 and 5mm which is the size of the grip thickness (where you grip the pick"}
{"source": ")  The white is soft, the medium grey is medium, and the dark grey is hard"}
{"source": "  I use the white and medium grey in 3"}
{"source": "1mm and find that easy to adjust too"}
{"source": "  They are soft and they do wear fairly quickly, but you just keep playing them or do a little cutting to sharpen them back up"}
{"source": "  You get a nice soft tone and, just like using any other plectrum, you develop a picking style to get various tones (double bass, acoustic, finger style, etc"}
{"source": "  I use the soft picks for a smooth tone, and the medium pick for a deep jazzy sound (think Motown"}
{"source": ")  I never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bag"}
{"source": "For a real trip, if you are able to finger pick, try out the Jam Cat pick holder sold here"}
{"source": "  It is so easy to switch from finger to pick in an instant and it is always there when you need to rock it up a bit"}
{"source": "These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar"}
{"source": " I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc"}
{"source": " Big disappointment"}
{"source": " I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem"}
{"source": " Back to the drawing board I go"}
{"source": "I tried it for iPad"}
{"source": " It kinda wobbles up and down"}
{"source": " It has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my iPad"}
{"source": "  I only recommend it for something light weight"}
{"source": "  There's better ones out there"}
{"source": " See my review on the music stand"}
{"source": " That comes with a solid extension arm"}
{"source": "OK, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need"}
{"source": " I bought it without hesitation"}
{"source": " HOWEVER(!), once hooked up, I was very surprised how flimsy it is"}
{"source": " I have a 13\" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it"}
{"source": " At the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand"}
{"source": " Obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off"}
{"source": " Using it at home, I've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal"}
{"source": " Since then, I've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though I haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, AND only costs a few bucks more (On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom)"}
{"source": " For anyone considering this product, I HIGHLY recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom"}
{"source": " You will be far far happier"}
{"source": "Cheers!"}
{"source": "These things grab the mic and won't let go"}
{"source": " They are worth the extra cost"}
{"source": " Buy them if you hate worrying about your mics slipping"}
{"source": "It does what it is suppose to, cut vibration and well I might add"}
{"source": " Much better than a standard clip on a mic"}
{"source": " This one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off, since it's rubber"}
{"source": " If it does break, has a lifetime warranty"}
{"source": " Had a Shure SM58 on a table, on a stand in this clip, pounded on the table, only picked up the tap sound my hand has making, and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table"}
{"source": " Moved the mic off axis, pounded again, absolutely no noise"}
{"source": " Can't ask for more than that"}
{"source": "I was upset when I bought the mic stand and didn't know the clip didn't come with it"}
{"source": "So I had to order a clip later"}
{"source": "Nevertheless, It has good design to dampen the shocks"}
{"source": "It is also rubber in construction so it won't crack like the other low quality clips"}
{"source": "It is a bit big for the cabled mics (so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag), but for wireless mics, it is good"}
{"source": "I would recommend it"}
{"source": "I purchased this for use with a Sennheiser E825-S microphone and the bestselling On Stage boom microphone stand"}
{"source": " The mount has exceeded my expectations"}
{"source": " The fit for the stand is perfect, with the mount pivoted so that the mike can be adjusted up or down"}
{"source": " The part actually holding the mike is flexible and rubbery, making it very easy to slide the mike and its cord in and out"}
{"source": " A screw tightens te pivot if this needs to be fixed more firmly in place"}
{"source": " All in all, a very worthwhile and economical purchase"}
{"source": "You can't have too many adapters if you are a sound guy"}
{"source": " This handy gadget converts a balanced or unbalanced mic cable to an unbalanced 1/4\" jack"}
{"source": " Simple and it works"}
{"source": " I've got a couple in my kit and they do what they say and come in handy when working with unknown equipment"}
{"source": "These plugs are well made and serve the purpose they were intended for"}
{"source": " If I buy more in the future I will be checking here first"}
{"source": "Works great, no issues"}
{"source": " Bought this to adapt the mike plug to 1/4\" jack so the mike can plug into a regular amp for the grandkids to \"karaoke\" with"}
{"source": "Useful for connecting mics to a guitar amp or directly into a computer's mic jack"}
{"source": " The 1/4\" side tends to become a bit loose after a while, not sure if it affects performance though"}
{"source": "The Shure XLR Female to Male 1/4\" Adapter is simply another one of those fix it gadgets that a sound mixer has to have in his kit"}
{"source": "I've got a bag of them and they work just like they are supposed to"}
{"source": "Now this one as pictured is the mono version, which you would use to take a balanced or unbalanced mic down to an unbalanced 1/4\" jack"}
{"source": " If you need to keep a balanced feed or if you are running stereo or two channel in a single cable, this adapter will not work for you"}
{"source": " You'll need the TRS (tip, ring, sleeve) balanced version of this adapter"}
{"source": "I purchased this to interface the XLR plug on a Sennheiser E825-S mike with the input on guitar amplifiers"}
{"source": " it seemed to work very well in this role"}
{"source": " It was well-constructed, with all the connecting points working precisely and securely"}
{"source": "Somewhat after the fact, I started worrying about whether I should have instead gotten an adapter with impedance matching capabilities"}
{"source": " I'm hardly a professional technician in this area, but I did do enough research to figure out a good working answer: Lo-Z (low impedance) microphones (say, 1,000 ohms or less) generally do not have to be matched to solid-state amplifiers, which are likely to have Hi-Z (high impedance) inputs in the range of 10,000 ohms"}
{"source": " These amplifiers ae generally designed to accommodate a 10:1 impedance ratio (load to source)"}
{"source": " I calculated the signal loss of such an arrangement in the range of 0"}
{"source": "83 decibels, which is incidental"}
{"source": "This corresponds to what my ears tell me: this adapter works just fine without impedance matching"}
{"source": " I can't say for sure whether that also holds for tube amps but will update my review if I have a chance to find out"}
{"source": "UPDATE: since I wrote my initial review, I have discovered that Pyle seems to have a problem securing its connectors properly with set screws"}
{"source": " If you purchase this item, I suggest you have a micro-screwdriver set handy so you can tighten everything up before you discover to your chagrin that a loose set screw has gone missing or caused your connector to fall apart"}
{"source": "This stand works fine if you don't need a shock mount"}
{"source": "  The base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations"}
{"source": "  I ran into trouble when trying to mount a R0DE NT2-A mic on a shock mount"}
{"source": "  The low height (4 1/2\") - which would otherwise help stabilize the mic - left too little clearance between the mic and desktop"}
{"source": "  If you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic, you're better off buying the slightly more expensiveOn Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand, Black"}
{"source": "BTW, my copy of this stand also did not have the 3/8 inch male thread"}
{"source": "This pedal is outstanding for the price"}
{"source": "  The feel is great and it doesn't move at all when you put it down on the floor"}
{"source": "  The only thing I disliked was that it doesn't support \"half dampening\" like most of the higher end pedals around this price range"}
{"source": "I got this for Christmas of 2007 and it is still going strong used every day in my recording studio"}
{"source": "Great product"}
{"source": "I've used this pedal with a Casio PX200 keyboard for about 6 weeks now"}
{"source": "Pros:-Sturdy construction (compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards)"}
{"source": "-Polarity switch - I was using a Yamaha FC4 with an older keyboard, but the FC4 does not work properly with the Casio keyboards"}
{"source": "  It's a tip-negative polarity, and the Privia requires a tip-positive polarity"}
{"source": "  So the piano would operate in reverse (sustain on until the pedal is depressed)"}
{"source": "  Thankfully, the SP-2 has a switch on the bottom that can switch and accomodate any keyboard"}
{"source": "-Cord is long enough (6')Con:-Build quality is slightly less than the FC4"}
{"source": "  The FC4 has a smooth action (made in Japan), but the SP-2 had some problems with the metal spring squeaking"}
{"source": "  Some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking"}
{"source": "The SP-2 also comes with a plastic cap if you prefer to cover the metal pedal"}
{"source": "  Overall, it is a solid product and almost a necessary upgrade for the plastic footswitch pedals"}
{"source": "You don't really need an expensive sustain pedal unless you're a concert pianist playing on a $10k keyboard- nuff said"}
{"source": "This pedal has a solid feel under my foot and gives me the 'push-back' I expect when playing live gigs"}
{"source": "  Always welcomed is the fact is stays in place where I put it on both wood or carpeted surfaces"}
{"source": "I thought I could take the smell"}
{"source": " I couldn't"}
{"source": "Otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding"}
{"source": "The case is nice too, but everything smells like the Chinese rubber smell at Harbor Freight Tools"}
{"source": " (sulfur?)I tried airing it out for a week with no success"}
{"source": "If you have no sense of smell, get one"}
{"source": "I was looking for a portable guitar that would survive the rigors of Afganistan"}
{"source": " I was going to get the Martin Backpacker, which I have actually seen and held in a store, but other reviews sold me on this Washburn"}
{"source": " The case was a particular positive point for me, and so was the 25% lower price"}
{"source": " I am more than please with what I have received"}
{"source": " The case is great for a traveling soldier, rugged and protective, with useful pockets"}
{"source": " The Guitar itself is very well made, nice pegs and solidly built for such an inexpensive instrument"}
{"source": " It does have a bit of a banjo like sound because of the small body, common to the type, as is the initial awkwardness figuring out how to hold, since the full sized fretboard overbalances the tiny body, and you can't exactly rest it on your leg like a regular acoustic"}
{"source": " The thing is, this guitar is just plain fun, it is always handy, durable, and plays pretty well"}
{"source": " Best buy I have made on a product I couldn't try out first"}
{"source": " A testament to the quality of the reviews on Amazon, which have rarely led me astray"}
{"source": "Picked up some Blue Steel lite stings and some brass abalone pins to enhance tone"}
{"source": " Also was the last to pick it up for $118"}

{"source": " Putting the brass pins keeps it from being too top heavy and helps to improve tone"}

{"source": "Just what I needed"}
{"source": "I am very happy with it and thank you"}
{"source": " Rich B"}
{"source": "This is a very good nicely wide guitar strap"}
{"source": "  Its weathered look is exactly what I was looking for"}
{"source": "  Its a nice solid piece of leather that looks like it will last decades"}
{"source": "  That is what I wanted but that is also why I got it weathered - to speed up about 5 years of personality"}
{"source": "  I'm not sure how you would wear it out really"}
{"source": "  Its buttery soft and doesn't have a strange fabric suede backing so it won't muck up your clothes, pill or crumble"}
{"source": "The only minus is that its a standard 53 inches though the description says its \"long\""}
{"source": "  Pretty standard vs all other straps"}
{"source": "I paired this with my reissue Fender Telecaster Thinline in natural"}
{"source": "  It looks wonderful"}

{"source": "-------------Update: Since I got the strap as a Christmas gift I've worn it to class and jam sessions"}
{"source": "  I started getting nice compliments about the guitar"}

{"source": "I've been recording professionally for 27 years; Music, radio commercials and television mostly"}
{"source": " So I'll try to give you the information you need to make your purchase"}
{"source": "I've owned and used so many mics and brands through the years I can't remember them all but I can I say I've never had a bad A-T"}
{"source": " 4033's, 4050's and 4080's I use every week and have for years, the 4033 going back to the mid 90's and the 2020 is just a lower priced electret condenser from the A-T family"}
{"source": " You have no idea the % of recordings that you're hearing this brand on, it's used by almost every studio on every continent, I work in the US, Italy to Scotland and can attest to this"}
{"source": " But first let me tell you, very simply, where the negative reviewers went wrong"}
{"source": "This is a XLR connection phantom powered mic, which is pro and best"}
{"source": " So it requires a phantom powered XLR input, which all pro equipment provides and is standard on most home recording audio interfaces"}
{"source": " Which you should really purchase along with this, if you haven't already, because for around $100 you'll improve your recording and playback and have a preamp and monitoring, you'll find one by searching audio interfaces"}
{"source": " I have a RolandRoland TRI CAPTURE Audio Interfaceand a Focusrite I use just for playback in my office and den but they work well and you don't need Avid HD's to get started"}
{"source": " Audio interface is just another name for an external sound card but will provide the proper input and gain meter"}
{"source": " Getting your interface away from the electronically noisy computer has been SOP since the dawn of digital"}
{"source": " I see that small USB mixers are available which would be another option"}
{"source": " Don't try an adapter on it, it won't work, as this needs power through the cord to charge the field effect transistor, but power supplies are available and after that adapt however you want"}
{"source": " It doesn't come with the cord, what a surprise! Quality cords will cost about half the price of this, but a $15 version will probably do for most"}
{"source": "It doesn't come with ashock mountbut you can purchase one if you like"}
{"source": " Work with it, you may not need one and the recorded vibrations rumbling will tell you that you do"}
{"source": " You'll need a windscreen and a popper stopper typeShure Popper Stopper Pop Filteris the usual, but I can also recommend using 2 large $1"}
{"source": "49 foam screens with the top cut from one as this mic is side address and you will need to cover the entire screen"}
{"source": " This isn't about being cheap, there are times that the goosenecks are very inconvenient and don't work at strange angles and you'll probably always need one or the other"}
{"source": "This does not come with a stand, so pick up a boom stand if you don't have one and pay no attention that the negative reviewers will tell you they tip over, 18 wheelers also tip over"}
{"source": "RecommendedUse a sandbag or whatever on the leg opposite the mic or remove the boom and top portion and slide on a barbell weight and put it back together or create a proper counterweight where they've put a faux plastic one"}
{"source": " If it's possible, you could mount a boom from the ceiling and run the cable on hooks, eliminating vibration from the floor while keeping the cable out the wayMicrophone Flange Male"}
{"source": " For desktop users, here's what I'd do"}
{"source": " Using large Command strips and Velcro I'd fasten this to the deskAdjustable Desk Microphone Standand attach thisTelescoping Mini-BoomHere's another optionMXL Mics MXL-BCD-STANDUnderstand that recording has progressed by meeting needs and experimenting, if you need something figure it out, your clean, quiet recording is proof that it works"}
{"source": "I can't justify comparing this to my $500 to $4000 mics like it but if there is a better value buy it"}
{"source": " $82 wouldn't have bought a case for most of my condensers"}
{"source": " It sure beats most non electret, electrostatic DC bias or dynamic style mics"}
{"source": " The 2020 is certainly an entry level professional mic and in many situations could be substituted for a 4033 without issue"}
{"source": " Also individual mics have a sound, of the eight 4033's I have, I prefer 3 of them and use them the most"}
{"source": " So when reviewers say it's bright, I say compared to what? I can tell you what it sounds like"}
{"source": "KA-CHING! a great sound in audio recording"}
{"source": " Uh huh, I know of one professional recording it's on and the client was clueless that I used an $82 mic"}
{"source": " Think about it, would this be as good as what was used 40 years ago? Have you heard good 70's recordings? Anyone purchasing equipment because it \"sounds\" better ought to have earned enough to slap down cash to pay for it"}
{"source": " Lot's of reviewers have opinions about this mic so don't ignore them but ask yourself this, do they have formal training and experience with 200 different mics in many studios and are they using expensive gear from their console to their monitors to reveal its true capabilities? Any noticeable increase in sound quality might cost $400 and won't be half of what you'll achieve by improving your recording technique"}
{"source": "This type of mic is excellent for overhead, acoustics, amps or brass and of course vocals, really most recording needs, having a less uni and more omni, cardioid directional pattern than stage mics hyper pattern it's better suited to recording"}
{"source": " Just understand you can't get too loud near it or you'll overdrive it since it's designed for up to screaming vocals, so back off with loud amps and brass, which also means you need a quiet place for recording because it'll pick up your AC ducts and your neighbor's TV"}
{"source": " That, is a good thing, what's bad is you trying to do good recording in a noisy environment, so don't blame a mic for your extraneous room noise"}
{"source": " You can't just use a different microphone or noise gates or processors of any kind, just quiet, anything else is a pail on a sinking ship because this is an acoustical, rather than electronic, signal to noise ratio"}
{"source": " A 10db pad will reduce output but doesn't affect the diaphragm and its input and acoustical foam won't help, that's not even its purpose, I suggest reading this on acoustics and foam, music"}
{"source": "tutsplus dot com/tutorials/beginners-guide-to-acoustic-treatment--audio-1274 (just replace the [dot])"}
{"source": " Turn off your heat/air, be careful of headphone bleed and do your recording between 3 and 5 AM, when the world's a quieter place and that will really help, you'll likely hear how loud your computer fans are"}
{"source": " You can get underground in your basement or build blanket walls, or buy used office partitions but you need quiet, I've known acoustic players who've worn gas masks to cut the sound of their breathing"}
{"source": " If this is what your budget allows for it's an excellent first step into recording and this type of mic and likely this brand would be my first choice for a first recording mic no matter the cost"}
{"source": " I keep saying \"this type of mic\" and the reason why is because A-T sells 14 models like this style up to $3000"}
{"source": " This model is the lowest priced but you're buying a reputable brand"}
{"source": " If your future plans include using only one mic, without the ability to use any traditional recording hardware, you can look here"}

{"source": "Now pay no attention to the descriptions of how it sounds, I won't tell you because how it sounds to me on my system won't apply to you and your system and that goes for all audio, descriptions are worthless, only unplugging one piece of gear for another matters"}
{"source": " This is important, all audio equipment either accurately reproduces or doesn't, the recording cannot sound better than the source, so a microphone can only reproduce sound more or less accurate than a different microphone"}
{"source": " Accurate or inaccurate, not good or bad, there's a difference"}
{"source": " It's during the mix that you make it better or different from the original sound"}
{"source": " Apply these same thoughts to your home stereo, saying instead, playback cannot sound better than the recording and that's why accuracy is important in your monitors"}

{"source": " It is great for recording acoustic guitar and vocals, don't start layering the vocals though, it starts to sound kind of weird"}
{"source": "I bought this as a gift for a friend he was really happy with it but, I have a completely different view"}
{"source": " The AT2020 is a pretty bright mic which sounds good at first but once you layer tracks on top of each other it can sound very harsh"}
{"source": " Second it is not a true large diaphragm condenser"}
{"source": " It is a very good mic for people starting out in music or just using it for podcasts, but there are a bunch of better mics near this price"}
{"source": " Two that come to mind are the MXL V67g and Studio projects B1 (stay away from the studio projects C1) both exceptional microphones for the price"}
{"source": " Although there is one mic you that is a bit more expensive but is absolutely amazing, the MXL 2003a"}
{"source": " A lot of people have claimed the studio projects C1 sounds like the Neumann u87 it doesn't, the MXL 2003a however sounds very similar and is easily the best LDC mic under $500"}
{"source": " With that being said the AT2020 is not a bad microphone but it is not great, to people who have just used built in mics on there computer or camera this will blow them away but as time goes on they will learn the limitations of this microphone"}
{"source": "Although to be fair I have a lot of experience in pro audio and production, so I maybe a bit overly critical"}
{"source": " One thing is for sure though; there are definitely better mics in or near this price range"}
{"source": "I love these strings because the sounds are so pure and not twangy, and they are pretty easy to use"}

{"source": "  I'm a beginner and can change my own strings, so I'm proud of myself"}
{"source": "Dont use the cheap fog liquid as it smells bad and gums up the system if you leave it in too long"}
{"source": "I got this last year for a small party and had the smoke alarm going off in my basement within seconds"}
{"source": "  This beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job"}
{"source": "It does get hot and drips at the front if you spray for too long but it does do what it's supposed to"}
{"source": "  Also note that the cap on the machine doesn't seal well and will drip if you angle the unit too much"}
{"source": "Keep it away from walls and floors as the oil will collect on them and leave you with a mess to clean up later"}
{"source": "  It's best on a stand 3-4 feet off the ground"}
{"source": "Overall build quality is very nice"}
{"source": "  Metal case, compact, nice bracket, lighted remote telling you when it's ready"}
{"source": "The threads on the tank are plastic as is the cap and can be damaged if you cross thread which is quite easy"}
{"source": "The material it's made of is good, and it holds the guitar"}
{"source": " The only things i don't like are 2"}
{"source": "1)Each of the corners has a cap"}
{"source": " The one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off"}
{"source": "2)The part at the bottom that looks like a U (used to hold the guitar) it spins"}
{"source": " It means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still, so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight"}
{"source": "I would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one"}
{"source": "This is a very useful item, easy to build and setup, easy to use"}
{"source": " I don't have any problem with this stand at all"}

{"source": "Highly Recommended!CFH"}
{"source": "I bought one of these for each of my electric guitars (3) and really like them"}
{"source": " They work great, were easy to assemble, and not expensive"}
{"source": " I do think the name is a bit inapproriate because I would never use one on stage, I don't think they are sturdy enough"}
{"source": " These are great if you don't have to worry about pets or children possibly bumping into them"}
{"source": " I realize you won't normally have pets or children on stage, but sometimes there are people moving around and guitars do get knocked over"}
{"source": " I recommend the On Stage XCG4 for home use or if you have a practice room where you know your guitar is safe"}
{"source": " I use these primarily for electric guitars but also have one for an acoustic and it fits very nicely"}
{"source": " Great deal for the very low price"}
{"source": "I paid 10 dollars for this"}
{"source": " It must be giving me cancer in the state of california because it's not cheap at all"}
{"source": " Folds up for transport, works great on hardwood floors, padded where it needs to be, and has a strap so it doesn't fall forward either"}
{"source": " Angle of the feet might be too shallow for carpet, look for something where the legs 'enter' the carpet more straight down"}
{"source": "This is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars"}
{"source": " The cradle and neck height are both adjustable enabling a variety of guitar sizes to be used"}
{"source": "  While it doesn't fold up small like a portable stand, it serves well as a semi-portable stand and is very good as a stationary stand"}
{"source": "This arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part"}
{"source": "Broken! OK"}
{"source": "I bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option"}
{"source": "it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!Obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box"}
{"source": "Of course,I could not recommend this product to anyone"}
{"source": "most disappointing purchase!"}
{"source": "Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top"}
{"source": "  A few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball end"}
{"source": "  Overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long"}
{"source": "  I will replace with 12s however"}
{"source": "  For me the 11s felt a little loose"}
{"source": "  The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box"}
{"source": "  I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model"}
{"source": "  I'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s"}
{"source": "I bought my first set of these strings about two years ago and havent looked back since"}
{"source": "  Awesome feel, sound and price"}
{"source": " Just the right thickness for playing all the classic rock and acoustic stuff that I do"}
{"source": "  I know they are electric strings but they do sound nice when playing acoustically written songs on my Strat"}
{"source": " One thing I notice with these is that they seem to sound new a lot longer than others I have tried"}
{"source": " Thats nice"}
{"source": "These strings have a tonal quality that will change your life, if you'eve ever wondered how the greats such as Wes Montgomery, George Benson, and Larry Coryell have been able to get their awesome, mellow tones"}
{"source": "  I'd recommend this even to metal players as a change of pace, as they may get something out of it that they've never considered before"}
{"source": "  Obviously, this takes someone who is willing to give a change to their accustomed style of playing a try"}
{"source": "  Trust me - I've been playing professionally for decades, and I can say that there's no way I'd turn my back on these as a jazz enthusiast"}
{"source": "  Also, if you're interested in saving the skin on your fingers, this product will help, as I haven't even come close to the normal amount of skin shedding experienced previously on roundwounds"}
{"source": "Flatwound? Ribbon wound?  It's all the same, no squeak, slick, jazzer mellow in tone"}
{"source": "  It's a sound that many would like to acheive"}
{"source": "  But why not round wounds?  Round wounds give a bit of grip, round wounds also have more surface area and are louder"}
{"source": "  Okay, but I have a pickup, want the mellower tone, sans finger noise"}
{"source": "  It's important for my playing to not have finger noise"}
{"source": "I have the Les Paul for harder edged music, but the archtop jazzbox pleads for a mellower tone, hence the flats"}
{"source": "I have a couple of friends who are really great Jazz guitar stylists, they both use D'Addario Chromes - over nickel, so I thought I would try them out"}
{"source": "  Nice, buttery smooth and I couldn't really recognized the difference over nickel flats, except the price, and the wear seemed a bit better"}
{"source": "Wear and tear is not really a factor for me, as I change out strings every 3 to 6 weeks depending on how much I'm playing"}
{"source": "Not ready to take the plunge?  It is a different feel, if not, try half rounds"}
{"source": "  They're a hybrid of both, less finger noise, a bit more surface area, hence output"}
{"source": "  Output is not a problem if you are amplified"}
{"source": "Check them out"}
{"source": "  I use the medium gauge, with a 13 high E, the G is wound also"}
{"source": "  Finger style or with a heavy Dunlap tortex pick, the attack noise is also reduced with the flats"}
{"source": "  I like them alot"}
{"source": "Thee only flatwound strings I've tried that sound significantly better than these are the Thomastiks, which cost twice as much, and they're not twice as good"}
{"source": " Maybe if I was a working pro I'd buy the Thomastiks, but for me, the D'Addarios sound good, and last a long time"}
{"source": "If you've never played flatwounds, you might be surprised to discover that they far outlast round wound strings"}
{"source": " That's because what kills the sound of strings is gunk from your fingers and the air getting in between the windings and damping the vibration"}
{"source": " Back when guitar strings were more a lot more expensive, it wasn't that unusual to remove strings, boil them, and put them back on"}
{"source": " Some electric bassists still do this"}
{"source": ") With flats, the gunk doesn't get in between the wraps, and if you don't break a string you can play a set for months"}
{"source": "I have different guitars set up with different strings ranging from "}
{"source": "010s (my Fenders) to "}
{"source": "013 (my archtop"}
{"source": ") Rockers playing "}
{"source": "010s and "}
{"source": "009s might be intimidated by "}
{"source": "013s, but they're not that much harder to play, and after a little practice it's easy"}
{"source": " Jazzers seldom if ever play six-string bar chords or bend strings, which means you just don't need that much muscle anyway"}
{"source": " Flatwounds are also generally set with a fairly low action"}
{"source": " They don't vibrate as widely as roundwounds, so they don't need as much clearance"}
{"source": "If you're looking for that classic electric jazz guitar sound, flats are the way to go, and the D'Addarios are as good as you need"}
{"source": " (Rockers looking for that 60s sound might try the D'Addario flatwound "}
{"source": "010s"}
{"source": " Almost the same sound as the Pyramids, and a lot cheaper"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "Have these on my Tele, very interesting to play around with"}
{"source": " I bought the regular gauge first and usually use pink slinkeys on all my electrics, the regular chromes where like telephone wires compared to my regular gauge so I bought these instead"}
{"source": " These were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys"}
{"source": " They still are heavier and you can really feel it when bending but they add a completely different feel to playing guitar and your tone"}
{"source": " When playing these I tend to play more sixties inspired, the flats help capture that surf guitar tone which is really cool"}
{"source": " I really like them but they are completely different and I wouldn't recommend them to everyone"}
{"source": " As far as CQ goes these are great, no problems, feel great, sound great"}
{"source": "Does the job of removing dust from you records without harming it"}
{"source": " The handle folds down when not in use to protect the bristles"}
{"source": " Over all a nice product"}
{"source": "This brush is used to remove static electricity and light dust from records before each playing"}
{"source": " This is not a deep cleaning, dust or dirt removal brush; it is a compliment to record cleaning solutions like this excellent liquid cleaner by Last (LAST PC Power Cleaner 3/4 Oz"}

{"source": " No fuss, no muss, no fooling around"}
{"source": " Never touch the carbon fiber with your fingers"}
{"source": " When there is visible dust on the fibers, give the brush a good flick by rotating the handle across the fibers"}
{"source": " After each use, rotate the handle around to cover the fibers"}
{"source": " If you press the brush too hard against the album, or do the deep dive sharp angle trick, fibers will be broken off the brush"}
{"source": " Just press lightly against the rotating LP, sweep the brush off the LP, and all will be wonderful with this brush"}
{"source": "This brush is sold under many different brand names, ClearAudio, AudioQuest, and Thorens"}
{"source": "The brush comes with no instructions for use, an odd omission"}
{"source": " Maybe there is an assumption that the brush is so easy to use, instructions would be redundant"}
{"source": "Audiophile or not, this brush is a must have for anyone that still loves analog recordings"}
{"source": "This is a great addition to any stereo system today, assuming you still use your turntable"}
{"source": "  Two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play, free of any annoying pops or clicks"}
{"source": "  It won't save a dirty record, you'll have to buy a cleaning solution for that, but this brush will easily take care of dust, hair, and other particles that get attracted to your LPs during regular use"}
{"source": "  As another reviewer suggested, I do the first pass with the brush going with the record, as if I was spreading out paint or something like that, and that gets most of the surface particulate free"}
{"source": "  The second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record, and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record"}
{"source": "  After that, your record will sound brand new again!There are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options, but none that are this easy and this cheap"}
{"source": "Seems to get a bit of dust up off the surface of the record, but frankly, the old Discwasher type with the fluid does a much better job"}
{"source": "  Better yet is to clean your records well with warm water and dish soap (and a new paint brush), then rinse them well and dry with a clean micro fiber cloth"}
{"source": "  Just try not to get the labels wet"}
{"source": "This is everything you need in a record brush"}

{"source": " Highly recommended!"}
{"source": "I was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot, or the floor"}
{"source": " The strap wouldn't hold my guitar any longer"}
{"source": " I wanted something cheap, something that don't require to remove the buttons by unscrewing it, I was worried about damaging my guitar"}
{"source": " So I decided to get this strap lock, it rocks and it works perfectly"}
{"source": "I bought two sets, this is a great why if to keep your strap on your guitar, if you still what to keep everything stock!"}

{"source": " I have a Planet Waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap"}

{"source": " I just have a normal planet waves strap, and it does not fit"}
{"source": " However, it does hold the XDS transmitter nicely and securely"}
{"source": " So looks like I will have to get creative with duct tape or something"}
{"source": "UPDATE:When attached with rubber bands to my planet waves strap, it stays on pretty snugly"}
{"source": " But you need to attach it with something"}
{"source": "What's most impressive isn't the top-drawer leather and craftsmanship -- that goes without saying from Levy's"}
{"source": "  it's the clever design, the way it fits onto almost any guitar strap, adjusts to almost any position, and adjusts to (almost) any small wireless transmitter"}

{"source": "This came in the mail today in a rather large box"}
{"source": " The blue LED light is fine, you can put about 5 medium picks in the Pick holder"}

{"source": " A great move toward a new generation of capos! Not cheap - but worth every cent"}
{"source": "This capo is expensive, but I have never found one that works so well"}
{"source": " It is worth the money in my opinion"}
{"source": "This capo is expensive"}
{"source": " The first time I (and everybody else) saw one, I said, \"Wow"}
{"source": " I can get a Kyser or something for fifteen bucks"}
{"source": " Get out of here"}
{"source": "\"Five capos later, I realize that I could probably have just shelled out the money, instead of purchasing every other capo on the market, one at a time, over the last fifteen years"}
{"source": "The first and last thing that really needs to be said about the G7th is this -- it doesn't put my guitar out of tune"}
{"source": " Virtually at all"}
{"source": " I can capo all the way up to the seventh or eighth fret and my micro-sensitive tuner shows that I'm still within one glowing light of being perfectly on"}
{"source": " That's it"}
{"source": " Yes, the G7th is sleek and beautiful, like a tiny sculpture, and glorious to look at, and sometimes I just want to stare at it"}
{"source": " Yes, it's easy to put on, just a mere squeeze of the hand away from being perfectly in place"}
{"source": " Yes, it appears to be sturdy enough to outlive me and my descendants"}
{"source": " But the tuning thing is all that really sets one capo apart from another, at the end of the day, and this one kills it"}
{"source": "I own three Shubbs, a Kyser, a Dunlop, and one of those rolling capos"}
{"source": " They're all good"}
{"source": " I don't hate any of them"}
{"source": " But this capo takes away all the uncertainty and irritation of being a fraction out of tune with the rest of the band, or with myself"}
{"source": " It makes playing guitar with a capo effortless and a joy"}
{"source": "As musicians, sometimes we find just the right sound or feel with a piece of equipment and it changes everything taking our performance to a new level"}
{"source": "  For me it happened when I found just the right sound & feel from my Taylor acoustic guitar, the right vocal mics, the right mixer, my Bose L1 Model II, etc"}
{"source": "Today I had one of those finds"}
{"source": " After years of being somewhat dissatisfied with every capo I've encountered I discovered the perfect capo for me: the G7th Performance Capo"}
{"source": "  I'm not kidding - it was one of those finds"}
{"source": "  As an acoustic guitar player / vocalist, obviously, I have to play all of my songs in the right key for an optimum vocal performance"}
{"source": "  This means occasionally relying on a capo to get just the right key with just the right chord shape/structure"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately, some of my songs had \"weak\" spots (sending them to my \"B\" list) courtesy of the combination of a \"weaker\" chord for me (due to physical limitations) & the reduced sustain & tonal quality resulting from using a capo"}
{"source": "  This dissatisfaction has had me on a \"capo quest\" which ended today when I found the G7th Performance Capo"}
{"source": "The first thing I noticed when I used the G7th was the improved sustain over every other capo I've used"}
{"source": "  All of those \"weak\" spots in my songs totally disappeared"}
{"source": "  I quickly dusted off several songs that were on my \"B\" list & found the improved sustain & tonal quality allowed me to move them to my \"A\" list"}
{"source": "I have no problem with the weight of this capo (others have pointed out that it is heavier) I can't detect any change in balance when handling my guitar (I play sitting on a guitar stool with the guitar resting on my leg - perhaps someone standing using a guitar strap might notice a slight difference in the balance"}
{"source": ")  I love the \"self-ratcheting\" feature of the G7th"}
{"source": "  I thought from some reviews & videos I watched that I'd have to pinch-down on the open end fairly firmly for a secure hold - this was NOT the case"}
{"source": "  I think the G7th has just the right width & density of foam under the top bar:  a) providing more \"friction\" to hold this capo in place;  b) playing a role in very effectively dampening the strings; & c) possibly being more gentle on the strings than a more narrow/harder foam or rubber top bar, thus having less impact on tuning"}
{"source": "I did find one slight negative about this capo which I was able to quickly overcome"}
{"source": "  The end of the top metal bar (on the open end of capo) is slightly more \"squared-off\" than the end of the bottom piece (which in contrast is rounded off)"}
{"source": "  It may be just the way I play some chords, but my hand was contacting that squared-off end of the top bar & was getting irritated - so I simply turned the capo around with the open end facing me (versus facing the floor) & the surfaces contacting my hand were far smoother - thus, zero  irritation"}
{"source": "  This was nothing new to me - I have had to do this with other capos"}
{"source": "Others have commented on the cost of this capo"}
{"source": "  For me, the cost of this capo was nothing compared to the many thousands of dollars I've spent finding just the right guitars, PA's, mics, & other equipment / accessories"}
{"source": "  I almost can't believe it only cost me $40 to make such a difference in my sound"}
{"source": " The G7th Performance Capo is priceless !!!Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this capo - if you're like me - this could be a very inexpensive way to take your performance to the next level !!!  I'm a strong believer in having back-ups for critical components so I will immediately purchase another G7th as a back-up (maybe I'll order the black or gold & use my silver one as the back-up)"}
{"source": "We bought the Pyle-Pro Lavalier Wireless Microphone System for use with thePyle Pwma230"}
{"source": " We needed an extra wireless mic for our workshop presenters and this was a very inexpensive choice"}
{"source": " For the price, this worked a lot better than I expected but it did take some adjustment to the \"Trim Screw\" on the receiver to get the clarity and range needed"}
{"source": " We also had to tape the little wire antenna up so it wasn't hanging in front of the speaker (this might not be an issue for you, depending on where you plug yours in)"}
{"source": "There are a lot of very expensive wireless mic units that I'm sure would provide better sound and range, but this one works just fine for our uses"}
{"source": "Overall, a good value for the low cost of this unit"}
{"source": "My wife & myself are a Celtic duo and a number of our shows are at renaiessance fairs where no visable pa equipment is allowed"}
{"source": " We considered a wireless to use with a battery powered Crate Taxi which could easily be hidden but most wireless receivers need a power outlet & at these events no power is available"}
{"source": " When I saw this at the price offered  and that both the mic transmitter and the receiver were battery powered I thought it was worth a try"}
{"source": " In the past we had a problem keeping an audiance because at some events where the natural acoustics are less than stellar they just plain couldn't hear the stories in the songs"}
{"source": " We use this to give our voices a small, unobvious boost"}
{"source": " It kind of has the effect of adding a tweeter to a speaker in that it gives our voices the clairity to be understood"}
{"source": " The result has been that audiances now stay for the entire show, laughing at the comedy, crying at the tragedy"}
{"source": "  Our tips & cd sales have gone WAY up"}
{"source": " Is it high fidelity? Quite simply, no"}
{"source": " But in our case it works beautifully"}
{"source": " Recommended, just remember the price point and you won't be disappointed"}
{"source": "I LOVE this mic as an indoor studio mic"}
{"source": "  I would not use it in a location with a high level of background noise as it is omni-directional and picks up quite a lot of extra noise"}
{"source": "  But when the conditions are quiet like in a studio, this mic ROCKS"}
{"source": " Clean, warm sound that picks up natural bass really well"}
{"source": "  Good for vocals (singing), or instruments like a guitar or piano"}
{"source": " Also have used it for some minor podcasting and it worked very well for that too!Comes with a dB limiter (-16dB)switch, right on the mic"}
{"source": "  Works really nicely at limiting background noise"}
{"source": "I would highly recommend this especially at the price"}
{"source": "  Comes with a decent hard case and SWEET shock mount"}
{"source": "  Very happy overall"}
{"source": "These microphones were made for the studio, I used it for live performance, you better have a good PA System to enjoy the sound, there everything that the video showed, it's a great microphone period"}
{"source": " Top of the line and it works great, thank you Marshall Electronics and Amazon"}
{"source": "I got this mic to record a vocal podcast and so far I'm very happy with the results"}
{"source": "  The sound quality is wonderful, the sensitivity is amazing!  Clarity is great, packaging is nice with the carry case and included stabilizer"}
{"source": "  I'm not an audio expert, but so far the sound quality out of this mic sounds very excellent to me"}
{"source": "This Mic has a nice tonal quality perfect for our Studio's here at ["}

{"source": " Sounds great and at the Right Price"}

{"source": " Really dope mic!"}
{"source": "Did a ton of research out there b4 I bought this"}
{"source": " I can't BELIEVE that so many manufacturers are asking for hundreds for freaking sheets of bent metal! What a racket it is"}
{"source": " If I could make one I would"}
{"source": " This one was cheap and does the job"}
{"source": " Dunzos"}
{"source": "It's a bent piece of metal with conveniently spaced slots and some sort of black coating"}
{"source": "powder coat? paint? who knows? it's black"}
{"source": "It's heavy enough that it doesn't flex unnecessarily"}
{"source": " It has some heft to it, so if you're trying to keep your rack super light be aware of that"}
{"source": " The coating is strong"}
{"source": " The pre-stamped slots go sideways so that if your gear does come loose, it slips sideways and not forwards, protecting the knobs"}
{"source": "I recently had to drill additional holes in one for a homemade piece of gear with totally random mounting hole locations, and it took a while to get through"}
{"source": "I like it enough that I bought another one"}
{"source": "These tuning machines are great"}
{"source": "They are a little heavier than the stock tuners on my guitars but they help keep your guitar in tune as intended"}
{"source": "I needed the tuners replaced on an Applause (Ovation copy) guitar (the bushings fell out of one of the tuners and it became really floppy and refused to stay in tune)and a Washburn guitar"}
{"source": " They fit on my Washburn and my Applause perfectly with zero need to ream or drill"}
{"source": "The tuner hole size is "}
{"source": "391 or 25/64 and of course if your hole size is smaller you must either use a drill or tuner reamer (yes a tuner reamer is a real tool just look at a place like Stewart MacDonald)"}
{"source": " You may be required to pre-drill for the screws that go through the back of the tuner"}
{"source": "It is only one hole and very small"}
{"source": "The vendor was quick in sending these tuners but there was no way to trace the package and it became difficult to receive it due to the fact it had to be signed for"}
{"source": "The run around at the post office of getting it re-sent was ridiculous"}
{"source": "The vendor should try to provide a tracking number so customers can avoid all of the back and forth and have an estimate as to when the package will arrive"}
{"source": "These things are heavy duty and thick"}
{"source": "  The stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things"}
{"source": "  Quality devices"}
{"source": "Put a set of these on my Rogue Grand Concert, now the guitar stays in tune beautifully! Worth every penny!"}
{"source": "I placed these on my usa made ovation baladeer"}
{"source": " Stays in tune well and does a better job than the stock Ping tuners"}
{"source": " This is the industry standard and you wont be disqppointed"}
{"source": " To those who say it doesnt stay in tune should have their guitar's bridge checked as flaws in the bridge can cause problems in tuning"}
{"source": "I bought these to replace the stock machine heads that came on my Hondo II \"The Paul\", which I bought in 1980"}
{"source": " The stock ones were loose, lots of backlash in the worm gears, and the guitar kept going out of tune even after the strings were fairly stretched out but still new"}
{"source": "They went in easily, if you follow this hint( if your machine head holes do not need to be enlarged, disregard this hint)- The holes for the old machine heads on the Hondo II were 0"}
{"source": "305\" in diameter, and these new Grovers need a 0"}
{"source": "390\" diameter hole"}
{"source": " So I had to find an accurate and clean way of enlarging the holes"}
{"source": " It's almost impossible to use a drill, even in a drill press, without splintering the wood on both surfaces of the headstock"}
{"source": " I read online suggestions about using a round wood file, and reamer, etc"}
{"source": " So what I did was first use a threading tap( for metal screw threads) which at the bottom had a 0"}
{"source": "290\" diameter, and at the top had a 0"}
{"source": "375\" diameter"}
{"source": " This is a standard 3/8\"-24 threading tap"}
{"source": " I chucked the tap into my battery-powered hand drill, set to low speed, and used the threading tap to cleanly and carefully enlarge the headstock holes to 0"}
{"source": "375\" in diameter"}
{"source": " Then I used a tapered reamer, from both sides, to enlarge the holes to the required diameter"}
{"source": " Quick, clean, easy"}
{"source": " If you have a different size enlargement to make, use the appropriately sized taps and a tapered reamer to get the holes to 0"}
{"source": "390\" diameter"}
{"source": "Another hint which you should follow is to replace only one machine head at a time, like when changing strings"}
{"source": " You don't want to take the tension off the neck and mess around with the truss rod"}
{"source": " At least I don't want to!Now the guitar stays in tune, and is easier and more accurate to tune"}
{"source": "A very worthwhile upgrade! Zero backlash in the worm gears on the Grovers, beautifully chromed and smooth as silk"}
{"source": "I swear by these quick release clips"}
{"source": " I can't imagine working without them"}
{"source": " I save so much time each time I use a quick release clip instead of unscrewing and re-screwing the original clips"}
{"source": " These are a great way to to mix and match multiple clips with multiple stands"}
{"source": " The first items I purchased when I started my last job as an Audio Engineer was these"}
{"source": " I've got no complaints"}
{"source": " They work great every time"}
{"source": "This guitar strap is very  comfortable and was easy to fit onto my electric Yamaha guitar"}
{"source": "Very durable and affordable"}
{"source": "My only gripe is that the color doesnt match my guitar as well as i thought it would"}
{"source": "Colors are abit too flashy"}
{"source": "This strap looks better in person than on the computer"}
{"source": " It has a nice soft feel and doesn't scratch the neck like the belt straps do and the color goes well with a varity of instrument looks and colors"}
{"source": "Re-strung my Eko Ranger 12 with these D'Addario EJ-38 light strings and am again getting a nice ringing tone with good sustain"}
{"source": "  No issues like breaking or dead strings that I had with Elixir's, just good sound"}
{"source": "I always love to D'Addario strings on my 6 string guitars so I decided to order these for my new 12 string Ovation 245"}
{"source": "  They sound great"}
{"source": "  Of course guitar strings can be a personal preference"}
{"source": "  Over the years I have been experimenting with various makes and  I always seem to return to these"}
{"source": "  This does not mean I will not try others"}
{"source": "  I surely will continue to experiment"}
{"source": "  I am one to change the strings on my guitars on a very regular basis"}
{"source": "  I spend my Summer in Canada and Winters in Florida and I can assure you that the climate is much drier in Canada than Florida"}
{"source": "  Strings on my guitars left behind in Florida for the Summer will deteriorate quickly even if they are in a humidity controlled environment"}
{"source": "  I  find the D'Addario strings will stay in better condition than others"}
{"source": "I have purchased two sets of the Mini Locking Rotomatics"}
{"source": "  No more winding string wraps around the tuning post"}
{"source": " Fastest string change ever"}
{"source": " Insert string, wind about a half turn, and the string is locked in the tuner"}
{"source": " No more slipping out of tune"}
{"source": " Rotomatics will go on every guitar build I do"}
{"source": "Against most educated and experienced advice from many blogs I installed one of these in my 1972 Twin Reverb 100 watt"}
{"source": " The original speakers are too Hi-Fi sounding for me"}
{"source": "They hurt my ears, so clean"}
{"source": " This speaker has all the range and a little bonus sizzle to boot, but in a round, full, musical way"}
{"source": " Again to those who may like to tread in my ill advised path, these are 50 watt speakers, the Twin Reverb is 100 watts"}
{"source": " Right now I have the CR and one original speaker running in my TR"}
{"source": " I'll get another CR if this one holds up okay"}
{"source": " But I'm in a band that plays small rooms a lot so I dont crank it past 4-5 very often"}
{"source": " I'll post an update if this speaker fails"}
{"source": " But at least on an initial run, I'm glad I bought it"}
{"source": "Rock And Roll Forever!"}
{"source": "The Eminence Patriot Cannabis Rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker I've ever heard"}
{"source": "  Period"}
{"source": "This does not mean that it's dull sounding or muffled at least, not if you hearing is still good"}
{"source": "  I hesitated quite a bit before I decided to buy it and install it in my Fender Mustang II but my worries were for naught"}
{"source": " Incredibly, it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds"}
{"source": "  Yet, for overdrive sounds, there is very little fuzziness - just a big full and FAT sound that's articulate without being buzzy"}
{"source": "  If you play metal you'll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy, classic rock and jazzy sounds, this is a speaker to seriously consider"}
{"source": "  I turned my Mustang II into an open back combo and the Cannabis Rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed"}
{"source": "  I had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps, it never got shrill or piercing, just buttery smooth and clear"}
{"source": " It's also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db@1W/1M"}
{"source": "I don't know how Eminence did it but I love it!"}
{"source": "These are a must-have item"}
{"source": " Heretofore, I've been using the Planet waves strap with a straplock mechanism"}
{"source": " While it's an innovative system that doesn't require any installation, the plastic ends are large and a bit awkward and can get in the way of things"}
{"source": "I installed the Schallers on my Warmoth Strat body -- I found that I needed to add some toothpick pieces per the recommendations of others to achieve a super tight fit -- not a big deal at all"}
{"source": " These Schallers are exactly what I wanted"}
{"source": " 5 stars, and a no-brainer"}
{"source": "Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago"}
{"source": "  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body"}
{"source": " I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass"}
{"source": "not good"}
{"source": " My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend"}
{"source": "The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself"}
{"source": "  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant"}
{"source": " none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon"}
{"source": "We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force"}
{"source": "We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not"}
{"source": "  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us"}
{"source": "I bought these through Amazon about a year ago and have installed them on all of my guitars"}
{"source": " I have both the nickel and black on heavy basses and they have never let me down"}
{"source": " I have since installed them on an electric and acoustic guitar out of convenience and purpose"}
{"source": " The locks work great and give you an added sense of security"}
{"source": "The reviews of the locks speak for themselves and no matter what style of guitar, whether it's a Les Paul, strat or active bass, I would strongly suggest them"}
{"source": " I have never used the Dunlop locks, but have heard that some Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls have mounting holes more suited for Dunlops"}
{"source": "One thing to note is that all of these come with their own longer screws to use if needed"}
{"source": " I never had to use them, but they are a nice touch and ended up in the parts bin"}
{"source": "This is my second set of these"}
{"source": " I bought the 1st set in the 1980's and I'm still using them on the guitar that they matched"}
{"source": " (black hardware)"}

{"source": " I'm loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through college"}
{"source": "I see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good"}
{"source": " I particularly don't think the horizontal axis point is very good, I mean where you adjust the angle of the boom"}
{"source": " It's a cheap version of a simple design and I suspect the day will come that you're trying to figure how to keep it from drooping, the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until something's got to give"}
{"source": " The tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and I'd predict someday you'll be going from duct tape to replacing it"}
{"source": " I base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement, which is harder on equipment than recording and because I own both types of businesses"}
{"source": " The boom in general isn't a nice one and will always be 32 inches because it isn't telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight, so you're mainly purchasing the stand"}
{"source": " On Stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series"}
{"source": "9701B Pro Tripod Microphone Boom StandJust like you can't compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup, this one is so inexpensive (too inexpensive?) that price comparisons aren't what's important, so looking at Amazon today I'd probably buy the 9700MS9701TB TeleBoom Microphone Standor this one,DR Pro Mic Stand Telescoping Boomor maybe try this oneHosa MSB-521BK Mic Stand with BoomI haven't tried that stand but since Hosa generally sells good inexpensive products I'd be inclined to give it a try"}
{"source": " I think you'll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice"}
{"source": " I'd pay attention to the 2 and 3 star reviews because you'll find more from experienced users and the most helpful 5 star do not say how long they've been using it but love how inexpensive it is"}
{"source": " Ignore that it doesn't come with a mic clip because usually they don't, clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately"}
{"source": " All but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced, so plan on putting weight on a leg if you're using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money"}
{"source": " $100+ will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight, like what's used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination"}

{"source": "Seriously, for those who don't need a stand that can handle touring or lots of fiddling around, this is the one to go with"}
{"source": "If you need a stand to handle doing live gigs and/or going on tour, shipping around in airplanes or vans, etc"}
{"source": ", you will need to go up a notch or two in quality (and, sadly, price)"}
{"source": "good quality for my casual use"}
{"source": "  I wouldn't use it on stage because of stability or weight related issues, it's too light"}
{"source": "This is a fine stand for the price, but I was honestly surprised at how light it is"}
{"source": " I honestly think On Stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price"}
{"source": " I do use this stand, but I wish I would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future"}

{"source": "I am totally satisfied with the stand"}
{"source": "  I had some misgivings after reading some negative reviews on Amazon but this stand serves me well"}
{"source": "  The misgivings I had was with the extra weight I intended to place on it with my tablet stand equipment and the Samsung tablet"}

{"source": " Here is what I have learned during the four or so years I have owned and used this model:- For the money they are a bargain and work extremely well in home studios and practice spaces (assuming the areas are not overly cramped"}
{"source": ")- They hold up under light gigging and jamming, meaning they are not transported more than two or three days a week"}
{"source": "- Good stability inside, even with heavier microphones like theBlue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone"}
{"source": " Not so good outside if there is a fair breeze"}
{"source": "I lost one to stepping inadvertently on one of feet, which immediately broke, and another has started binding when I try to extend or collapse the center pole"}
{"source": " Those problems are not necessarily quality issues since in the case of the broken tripod it was my fault and not the gear's"}
{"source": " As for the binding - I am sure that a good amount of grime has found its way into the tube after four years of use and transporting the stands"}
{"source": " Had I taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented"}
{"source": "For inexpensive stands these are hard to beat"}
{"source": " However, I now use theSeismic Audio - Tripod Microphone Mic Boom Stand - PA/DJ/Band/Church/Wedding use, which I consider to be a superior stand for a small increase in price"}
{"source": " Also, for outside use or when stage real estate is an issue I have found the old school styleOn Stage MC7201B Round Base Microphone Stand, Blackto be a far better solution"}
{"source": "This could be used for lightweight microphones but don't bother wasting your money if you're using a studio microphone"}
{"source": " The base has a small circumference, so you can't stick the boom out very far at all, almost useless"}
{"source": " There are better deals for just slightly more money"}
{"source": " Or if you really want near studio quality, try the Samson studio boom mic stands"}
{"source": "I use this for my home recording studio"}
{"source": " This stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle"}
{"source": " From playing and singing piano, recording guitar and vocals, and other various positions"}
{"source": " Sometimes hard to keep the mic firmly in place but that may be a function of my shock mount"}
{"source": "Cheap and highly recommended"}
{"source": "Got this stand to mount a Studio Projects C1 condenser mic"}
{"source": "  The stand is very stable and works well"}
{"source": "  It is very reasonably priced as well"}
{"source": "It's well built enough to stand up to regular use"}
{"source": "  I use mine for recording and some performance"}
{"source": "  It' works great"}
{"source": "Provides everything I need from a mic stand"}
{"source": "  Everything locks up nice so the stand remains firm"}
{"source": "  Packs up small"}
{"source": "  I knocked off one star because if you look carefully at the stand, it leans ever so slightly"}
{"source": "  It is after all a cheap Chinese stand"}
{"source": "The only reason I'm not giving this one star is that I didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal"}
{"source": " I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals"}
{"source": " We have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs"}
{"source": " I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile"}
{"source": " NOPE"}
{"source": " This pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way"}
{"source": " AVOID"}
{"source": "I've written here before that it would be nice to find a multi-pedal arrangement for space saving"}
{"source": "but I still end up looking at individual pedals for their individual sounds"}
{"source": "Musicfriends, This is a fab item - For 20"}
{"source": "00 You can't go wrong on this"}
{"source": " Warm distortion and good controls"}
{"source": " For me great studio/recording use but thats it"}
{"source": " I would certainly not tour with it"}
{"source": " its built cheap w"}
{"source": " plastic housing and one circuit board squeezed in and funny enough the one piece rugged metal"}
{"source": " is the bottom plate"}
{"source": " Hello designers"}
{"source": " Metal around top and plastic on the bottom if you must"}
{"source": " But anyways, bottom line great unit for 20"}
{"source": "00 and sounds good very versatile"}
{"source": "I was looking for a pedal that didn't take my life's savings and still performed well"}
{"source": " I found it right here, it  works well with no problems to report"}
{"source": " next week I'll purchase another (with a different feature)"}
{"source": " It also arrived super fast"}
{"source": "I purchased this as my first guitar slide"}
{"source": " I loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces"}
{"source": " I almost cut myself! I will never buy a glass slide again, I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it"}
{"source": " The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break"}
{"source": " I would not suggest this to anyone"}
{"source": " The metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better"}
{"source": " There's a reason ALL pros use metal! The review below is wrong"}
{"source": " Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger, all the way to the tip"}
{"source": " You don't bend your finger to play slide"}
{"source": " You retune your guitar to an open tuning"}
{"source": " Just thought I would point that out"}
{"source": "Clear sounding slider works pretty good in the studio"}
{"source": " I did drop it a couple times (ok, maybe more than a couple) on the wood floors of stages without a problem"}
{"source": " Then one day, in the frigidly cold outdoors, I dropped it on a concrete floor and it completely shattered, oops"}
{"source": "I've been using this mic cable for over ten years, and it had come up missing after an event"}
{"source": " I looked everywhere I could think of, and thought I had lost it for good"}
{"source": " One day, I happened to look between a ball of TV cable wire in the rehearsal room, and there it was"}
{"source": " I didn't remember where I'd gotten it, or even the manufacturer"}
{"source": " Although I have more than a dozen mic cables, this pliable cable, with it's own elastic clasp, was always my favorite"}
{"source": "  I was ecstatic the day I found it, after months without it, and now have a backup"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this cable"}
{"source": "If you want a little more &#34;meaty&#34; sound and feel on les pauls and similar guitars, this set is the ticket"}
{"source": "Just slightly heavier feel but much more tone"}
{"source": "As usual, after switching to heavier strings you may have to tighten your truss rod a bit to compensate for greater string tension"}
{"source": "Good strings"}
{"source": "  They work and sound good"}
{"source": "  I didn't notice much of a difference between these and run-of-the-mill D'Addario strings"}
{"source": "If you want an inexpensive \"pure nickel\" string get theDR Strings Pure Blues Pure Nickel Wrap Round Core"}
{"source": "They feel nice, are nicer to your frets, sound smooth and mellow for the blues or any genre"}
{"source": " They bendnicely and sustain just as well"}
{"source": "I know guitar strings can be a personal thing, and there are more expensive pure nickels out there, butat this price point try a set of these as well"}
{"source": " You may be surprised"}
{"source": "I have rated this set at '4' stars because only after about 16 hours of practice the 'D' string windingbroke at the second and third fret of my Gibson Standard"}
{"source": " No damage to the frets and it was easilydiscovered because the string sounded dull, almost dead"}
{"source": " Strange"}
{"source": "I recently went 'electric' again after 20+ years"}
{"source": " So electric guitar strings are basically a new experiencefor me again"}
{"source": " That said, I never had an acoustic wound string have its winding come loose in over 30years  of playing"}
{"source": "I put another set on my electric and have had no further problems"}
{"source": " I have not heard of this happeningto anyone else"}
{"source": " Maybe its no big deal, so no one remarks on it"}
{"source": "UPDATE 07/14/2013: I am still using DR Blues on my guitars and have not had any further problems withthem"}
{"source": "UPDATE 01/08/2014: I just had the D string windings break on a new set"}
{"source": " Different guitar but broke onthe same frets as reported above"}
{"source": "I did a little research to find the best strings and other reviews aimed me at these"}
{"source": "  I just got done stringing them and they sound great"}
{"source": " I think these will be what I play from now on"}
{"source": "A strap is a strap, what can you really say about it? It was about $5 with prime shipping and connected to my guitar just fine"}
{"source": " It's comfortable and fits my bass well"}
{"source": " I'm a bigger guy and have plenty of length if I needed it"}
{"source": " Nice value"}
{"source": "Bought this strap for use with my Dean EVO electric"}
{"source": " It's very nice and durable, though the leather on the ends was really tough to get around the strap holders on the guitar since the strap is really heavy-duty"}
{"source": " It works great, though, and for the price it's wonderful"}
{"source": "If you need a simple, normal-length strap, this should work fine"}
{"source": "  However, if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side, this is not what you need"}
{"source": "  I bought this but wound up ordering theErnie Ball 4037 Black Polypro Strapinstead"}
{"source": "  Very similar look and feel, but the Ernie Ball is MUCH longer"}
{"source": "  The lowest I could get this to hang was just above my waist"}
{"source": "  Again, not a bad strap, just not for us tall guys :)"}
{"source": "i ordered with my new guitar"}
{"source": " These straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here"}
{"source": "this is a nice strap"}
{"source": " It's kinda  hard to get on the 1st time because it's stiff"}
{"source": " That turned out to be good  good thing while dissecting the underbelly of swamp rat, it would  be sad if your axe fell in your soup!"}
{"source": "Very nice quality, inexpensive guitar strap"}
{"source": " A little tough to get on"}
{"source": " that just means it's not going to come off with use, just make sure it is all the way on before you start using it! Using this on my Ibanez ART100 electric guitar"}
{"source": " The pick pocket is a nice extra"}
{"source": "I recently purchased two Protec guitar straps in order to avoid having to switch straps between instruments"}
{"source": "  These straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here"}
{"source": "  These are also a nice medium width, so they should be suitable for all kinds of players"}
{"source": "  Although one reviewer complained about the size of the holes for the strap buttons, I actually find the snug fit to be an advantage:  it doesn't feel like I'll have to worry about the strap coming disconnected from the guitar"}
{"source": "  And, the price is right"}
{"source": "Pro Tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments"}
{"source": "  Their low cost black nylon guitar strap, is a well constructed high quality item, that is a top seller at Amazon"}
{"source": "  The large sized attachment tabs are quite thick, about 1/8 inch"}
{"source": "  Although the fit on the typical guitar strap nuts is snug, some type of strap retainer would still be recommended"}
{"source": "  Black works with most colors, and this strap should last for a long time, but it is so inexpensive, if you qualify for free shipping, you might want to consider ordering a spare"}
{"source": "Nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern"}
{"source": " It fits my ovation quite snuggly, I bought some retainers, but found them unnecessary so far"}
{"source": " I couldn't remove this strap if I wanted to, well I could but its just too much work"}
{"source": " So it will stay where it belongs for a few years at least"}
{"source": "The only thing I don't like about this strap is the edge of the strap is a bit abrasive on my bare neck"}
{"source": " Not a problem in the cooler months when I'm prone to sweaters and such, but in the summer it takes a bit of getting used to"}
{"source": " It's made of a canvassy cotton, so its strong, but its also a little rough"}
{"source": " I'm going to try waxing the edge with canning wax or candle wax and see if that smooths it down a bit"}
{"source": "It is a very nice strap and will last years"}
{"source": " I like it almost as much as my 40 year old ACE strap, which is much softer due to 40 odd years of use and abuse by a multitude of musicians"}
{"source": " But finding an old ACE for anything close to this price is a fools journey"}
{"source": "Buy one, then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny"}
{"source": " You'll be ready"}
{"source": "I just ordered three different guitar straps online"}
{"source": " One for my daughter and at first a cheap one for myself"}
{"source": " Then I found this and decided to get it"}
{"source": " The $5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff"}
{"source": " I got this and switched over"}
{"source": " Ahhh this is a guitar strap! I see why you pay more"}
{"source": " It is so soft and comfortable"}
{"source": " It looks AMAZING! This is just a great product"}
{"source": " I would highly recommend it to anyone and am proud to use it on my guitar"}
{"source": " Thanks!"}
{"source": "There's not a whole lot one can say about a guitar strap, but I'll try"}
{"source": " This one is sturdy and adjusts more easily than some I've tried"}
{"source": " It's fairy thick and the material doesn't slip around on your shoulder easily"}
{"source": " Aesthetically, the woven print is abslutely beautiful"}
{"source": " The photo cannot do it justice"}
{"source": " The colors and rich and vibrant and the weave is tight, not chintzy or frayed"}
{"source": " I'm very pleased with the product and the price"}
{"source": "I have several of these straps in different colors and I've never been disappointed"}
{"source": "  It holds my 11 pound Les Paul with no problems and the first one I bought has been through quite a few gigs and is still holding up strong"}
{"source": "  If you like the design, go for it!"}
{"source": "The look of this strap caught my eye, I have a light colored natural look to my acoustic guitar and the blue complements it really well"}
{"source": " The design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud"}
{"source": " Strong build, sort of a double layered nylon strap, and nice thick leather for the ends(one end was actually pretty difficult to put on the guitar when still new, but it should be easier with some wear)"}
{"source": " Easy to adjust, comfortable"}
{"source": " I think that with many things you get what you pay for, and this strap is definitely worth the added cost over the cheap kinds you can get"}
{"source": "I installed the Ragin' Cajun into my Fender Super Champ X2"}
{"source": " I immediately noticed a difference in the quality, fullness and volume of my amp"}
{"source": " It has turned my amp into a amp that is now capable of being used at small gigs"}
{"source": " An excellent speaker that I would highly recommed"}
{"source": "I installed the Ragin' Cajun into my Fender Super Champ XD"}
{"source": "  I read all of the reviews of people saying this speaker turned their Super Champ into a monster and man they were right!  I immediately noticed a difference in the warmth, articulation, and fullness of my sound!  The cleans are warm and"}
{"source": "clean, and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely"}
{"source": "  I had been trying to play Tool's \"Jambi\" and the beginning part never sounded right"}
{"source": "  I always thought I was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned"}
{"source": "  Tried the same lick with the Ragin Cajun and it sounds perfect!  I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone that owns a Fender Super Camp XD or needs a 10 inch speaker"}
{"source": "Two items of note:  1) A few people said this is a bass heavy speaker and I do not agree"}
{"source": "  While it is slightly darker than the stock speaker, it has a screaming Mid/Low range"}
{"source": "  A quick turn of the Treble knob from 4 to 6 cleaned up the darkness"}
{"source": "  2) Don't forget, the first time you install the speaker will be the worst it will sound"}
{"source": "  All speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot"}
{"source": "  With that said, this thing sounds amazing directly after install"}
{"source": "  Buy, you won't regret!"}
{"source": "I installed this in a Super Champ x2"}
{"source": "  As others have pointed out you'll have to turn the treble down after installing it"}
{"source": "  That's because it's designed for making solos stand out"}
{"source": " I"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", for adding punch"}
{"source": "  If you're a lead guitarist, this speaker will make your guitar sing"}
{"source": "However, if you mostly play rhythm, I'd stick with the stock speaker"}
{"source": "I want to put two of these into my 4x10 Blues DeVille to increase its range and make solos sing, while letting the stock speakers give me some bottom"}
{"source": "If you play Rock or Classic Rock & have a Tube amp with a 10 Inch speaker that needs a little more life"}
{"source": " Pop one of these in"}
{"source": " My little  VHT Special 6 Came Alive with this speaker"}
{"source": " Love It!"}
{"source": "Simply put, this speaker turned my Super Champ XD into a killer 15watt amp"}
{"source": " Gave the amp more low-end and made everything much clearer"}
{"source": " I would, and do, recommend this speaker to anyone wanting to upgrade their Super Champ sound"}
{"source": " And, like other people have said, the speaker is much louder on the same volume setting"}
{"source": " I had to turn the amp down two notches (two number) to have the same volume level out of the amp"}
{"source": "If my Super Champ was stolen, I'd buy a new one and put this speaker in it"}
{"source": " Wouldn't even think twice about it"}
{"source": "Used these for years on son's electric guitars"}
{"source": " No fuss"}
{"source": " Mechanics do not seems to wear out, still gripping"}
{"source": " No way at all to knock the guitar off the wall"}
{"source": " No neck damage to axes"}
{"source": " Mounts well, but try to find a stud, certainly"}
{"source": " Keeps the guitar far enough away from wall that brushing against it does not hit the body to the wall"}
{"source": "No complaints"}
{"source": " If you're going to drill your wall, is it really worth it to buy a simple fork style wall hanger with no means to keep your guitar on it if it gets bumped when for a few bucks more you can get the undisputed champion of guitar wall hangers"}
{"source": " All 5 star reviews on this baby"}
{"source": " And I agree, and I add to that total"}
{"source": "  5 stars"}
{"source": "Just to confirm several other reviews - these hangers are really nice"}
{"source": " They add a nice look to your room and they perform a much-needed function very well"}
{"source": " As other have said, though, the drywall mounts are pretty much useless and I DON'T recommend you trust your guitars to them if installed in drywall!Even my lightest guitar was pulling the block away from the wall, so there's no way I'd trust any of my \"proper\" guitars to these things! I bought some heavy-duty anchors from the local DIY store (you can get them from Amazon tooTOGGLER SNAPTOGGLE BA Toggle Bolt with Bolts, USA Made, For 3/16\"-24 Fastener Size (Pack of 10)) and enlarged the hole in the block slightly to accommodate the thicker screw"}
{"source": " Much better! I have a few of these, holding up a Les Paul type, a Strat, a Godin and a G&L; tele and they've been holding up (pun intended!) fine for a few weeks now"}
{"source": "This is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people"}
{"source": " Great for people with babies/toddlers looking to get their guitars off the ground like myself"}
{"source": "I love the unique self-locking mechanism that it has"}
{"source": " The weight of the guitar lowers the hanger and moves the lock levers up so your guitar neck is securely fastened"}
{"source": " I have an electric and an acoustic hanging up"}
{"source": " The acousitc's body is about 4"}
{"source": "5\" thick and has plenty of clearance from the wall when hung"}
{"source": " The electric I think weights around 8 pounds and it held no problem by the Hercules hook"}
{"source": " I believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbs"}
{"source": "I only installed into studs and wouldn't really want to try a drywall-only installation"}
{"source": " The product does come with drywall anchors but many of the reviewers said the included drywall anchors are cheap and not that good"}
{"source": " The wood screws that came with the product I found to be a little short (if you were installing on dry-wall in front of a stud)"}
{"source": " Others found this to be true too"}
{"source": " I bought #8 Wood Screws in 2"}
{"source": "5\" length at the hardware store and these worked perfectly for my install"}
{"source": " The included screws I  think are about 2\" in length or a little less"}
{"source": "I was first exposed to the Hercules locking mechanism when our Praise Band leader brought in his Hercules two-guitar stand and I tried it with both my full-size 12-string guitar and my 5-string banjo"}
{"source": " I was impressed"}
{"source": " When I decided to buy some guitar hangers to reorganize my music room/amateur studio, I was excited to find that the same Hercules mechanism was available in a couple wall-hanger models"}
{"source": " I put them on my wish list, where my son & daughter-in-law found them and bought three for me for Christmas this last weekend"}
{"source": " I just finished putting them up and I'm completely satisfied with their solid construction"}
{"source": " They give me confidence that they will hold my instruments reliably"}
{"source": " I used the provided screws, which worked great for mounting them on the plank walls"}
{"source": " I probably wouldn't trust the hollow wall anchors provided for drywall, but instead get something more substantial to mount it (like a toggle anchor)"}
{"source": "What I'm happiest about is that these hangers can be used with a variety of stringed instruments"}
{"source": " The opening is wide enough to accommodate my classical guitar and 12-string guitars but not so wide as to not support my 5-string banjo"}
{"source": " (I've submitted a photo showing them holding up a classical & 12-string guitars, and 5-string banjo)"}
{"source": " My friend plays Gretch semi-hollow body and Fender solid-body (and other) electric guitars with his Hercules 2-guitar stand, so I assume they would also work with the wall hangers"}
{"source": "I am happy to recommend this handy little device to anyone who wants to get their favorite instrument up out of the way but still keep it handy"}
{"source": "I have purchased six of these over the last couple years"}
{"source": " Why? Because they work"}
{"source": " They mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place"}
{"source": " I don't think I'd ever buy any other device to hang a guitar on my wall"}
{"source": " They feel rock-solid too"}
{"source": "I highly recommend and will be buying more in the future"}
{"source": "I gave it 4/5 stars because I haven't used any other devices like these before - maybe there is something better, but I haven't seen it yet"}
{"source": "~Slick"}
{"source": "I've two of these stands"}
{"source": " On one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld"}
{"source": " If you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there"}
{"source": " Mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - I was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor!UPDATE: 1/9/12 GLEN INGLES REFUSES TO REPLACE OR REPAIR THE STAND"}
{"source": " BEWARE! "}
{"source": "and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in"}
{"source": "wait for it"}
{"source": "China"}
{"source": " That may explain why it failed, but Glen Ingles could have offered to replace it"}
{"source": " I guess he doesn't want me to buy any more of his products, or refer others to his products"}
{"source": " Well, that's his policy"}
{"source": " That's okay, he's got competition, and I'll be purchasing from them instead"}
{"source": "When this product appeared to be defective I contacted the seller"}
{"source": " While they agreed to an exchange they did say that I was liable for up to 5"}
{"source": "81 in shipping costs"}
{"source": " I thought that more than 25% of the item's cost was a bit much"}
{"source": "I decided to conatct the ON STAGE people directly"}
{"source": " Not only did they seem genuinely cocerned about their product living up to their standadrs they patiently and politely guided me through the proper set-up, determined that the item was defective and then pronmised me a replacement without having to return the defective item, a microphone boom"}

{"source": "I have been using ON STAGE instrument and microphone stands for several years now"}
{"source": " They are extremely well manufactured, they look great and are sturdy as heck"}

{"source": "Haven't played the toy harps yet, first things first"}

{"source": "  I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good"}
{"source": "  Wow, was I wrong"}
{"source": "  Too hard to push notes through them"}
{"source": "  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone"}
{"source": "I tried these on my 2008 Talyor GA4e and the sound was just a bit to bright"}

{"source": "  YMMV"}
{"source": "Tried these on a Laguna acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " They are basic standard traditional strings"}

{"source": " My preference is to use Elixirs, prefer the feel and sound on this guitar (Elixir PolyWeb Acoustic Guitar Strings (Light))"}
{"source": "These strings do not last less time than the Elixirs"}
{"source": " Mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar"}
{"source": " Some people like a brand new set before every gig, others will go weeks or months before changing"}
{"source": " If you are an every gig person, well the Martin set is probably perfect for you - they are much less expensive than others"}
{"source": " Leaving strings in for an extended period - Elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better idea"}

{"source": " The choice is all about your personal preference and the guitar you play"}
{"source": " I think the Martins are a very good value in a standard traditional style"}
{"source": " So for the price, these are an excellent value"}
{"source": "After reading all the great reviews, I moved to these Light/Medium strings from the light gauge"}
{"source": " They do sound much better and have a better tone than the light gauge"}
{"source": " However, I noticed one thing that has driven me crazy"}
{"source": " Finger slides are much harder with these strings"}
{"source": " The lower strings (E, A G) just don't slide as easily until there is some buildup in them"}
{"source": " As a result my fingers get out of position and don't hit clear notes until I've slid those areas a couple of times"}
{"source": " That's probably due to the oil and other nasties build up in the strings or me just getting used to them"}
{"source": " The packaging was also a bit confusing"}
{"source": " Since there are two strings to an envelope, it seems I too easily get the strings reversed on set up"}
{"source": " Other string makers I have tried, color coded their strings and it made it much easier to string up"}
{"source": " Overall good strings and I'll probably buy them again"}
{"source": "By definition, medium is an in between size"}
{"source": " But when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium"}
{"source": " On that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium"}
{"source": " For me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument"}
{"source": " I don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up"}
{"source": " But I do have periods where I will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me"}
{"source": "Medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me"}
{"source": " Light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end Martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line"}
{"source": " For me, these light-medium are exactly where I want my strings to be"}
{"source": "If you like Martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice"}
{"source": " I don't feel I am missing anything compared to the Medium"}
{"source": " If I had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, I would probably find differences in a side by side comparison"}
{"source": " But without that, I don't think I'd notice the difference with normal listening"}
{"source": " With the lighter varieties, that would be far from true"}
{"source": "If Martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste"}
{"source": "Personally, I love the nanoweb strings"}
{"source": "  I have 4 guitars, and they each get played once every couple weeks"}
{"source": "  As I'm no pro, I don't want to put strings on them that I'm going to have to change every time, just to mess around at my apt"}
{"source": "I don't mind that they are extra slippery, or that they sound a tad bit \"different\" than other strings"}
{"source": "  They're exactly what I want - A string that makes my guitar sound good for 4 months without changing strings"}
{"source": "These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " They are just the right weight, and just the right amount of flex"}
{"source": " We've tried D'Addario, brighter sound (D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set, EXP 80/20 Lite), and Martin, a little stiff (Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12"}
{"source": "5-55 MSP4150)"}
{"source": " In the end, these Elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar"}
{"source": "The difference between these strings - nanoweb and polyweb - the nano's have a very light coating that you almost don't feel"}
{"source": " So if you like standard not coated strings, the nano's are probably the way to go"}
{"source": " If you want a bit of softness, the polys are a better bet"}
{"source": "As has been said, there is no perfect guitar string for everyone"}
{"source": " The perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar"}
{"source": " For the combination we have, these are outstanding strings"}
{"source": "On the strings lasting longer, that's hard to say"}
{"source": " Fresh strings do sound better"}
{"source": " It's clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings"}
{"source": " But I'm not certain these last so much longer"}
{"source": " We buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability"}
{"source": " Corrosion or crud on the string isn't the sole factor in changing strings"}
{"source": "Elixir is a wonderful company"}
{"source": " On my third or fourth sets of Elixir strings, the G string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time"}
{"source": " Elixir is outstanding, they will replace any string that doesn't perform up to your standard"}
{"source": "The other amazing thing - I've watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings, and I'm still very confused"}
{"source": " The Elixir website (it's pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding"}
{"source": " Ther is a two part video from the Taylor factory on how to change strings"}
{"source": " I swear that if you follow those instructions, you will change strings in minutes"}
{"source": " It is so simple and so reproducible"}
{"source": " I love this technique"}
{"source": "Dont be cheap"}
{"source": "  take it to a guitar shop and ask for a full tuning for new guitars"}
{"source": "  The low e buzzed pretty bad until i did that"}
{"source": "  If you are doing more than just finger-picking, you might want to add pick-shield"}
{"source": "  My wife used it for some naked newborn pics and the guitar got most of the compliments which I had very mixed feelings about"}
{"source": "  If you play mostly standing, this is the guitar for you"}
{"source": "  If you sit down, it slides out from your lap alot due to the curve of the back"}
{"source": "  But it is loud and sounds very rich considering the price of the guitar"}
{"source": "  Good structural integrity thus far"}
{"source": "  My newborn is now 15 months and its is holding up nicely considering how many times she has gotten a hold of it"}
{"source": "  I really should get a case"}
{"source": "No Doubt"}
{"source": " It's not a really exceptional guitar but for the money you get more than you should"}
{"source": " First impression of the guitar was terrible"}
{"source": " I took it out of the box and started to play"}
{"source": " The neck had a huge bow in it"}
{"source": " The truss rod was completely loose"}
{"source": " I had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable"}
{"source": " I'm not sure if it was just my guitar that wasn't set up or if that's the way they come"}
{"source": " If they come with a loose truss rod then this guitar is not for a beginning player as properly adjusting the neck is best left to someone who knows what they are going"}
{"source": " Once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned I was pleasantly surprised"}
{"source": " The guitar sounded pretty good"}
{"source": " The neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric"}
{"source": " Action was good"}
{"source": " Upper fret access is really good"}
{"source": " The guitar stays in tune while playing"}
{"source": " Plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises"}
{"source": " The bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch"}
{"source": " I expected red paint"}
{"source": " I would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting"}
{"source": " They are a little small"}
{"source": " $175 for a roundback is really a no brainer"}
{"source": " If your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers"}
{"source": "This instrument might actually be in a class of its own"}
{"source": " That is, it would be extremely difficult to find a guitar in this price band that comes even remotely close in terms of quality; not only with regard to craftsmanship, but certainly the sound it produces"}
{"source": " The Applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged, amplified, or even run directly through a mixer"}
{"source": " Beyond sounding comparatively spectacular, it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollow-bodied instrument on the market due to its components and design"}
{"source": " The electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible, or playable, to even the most novice of musicians"}
{"source": " This guitar is the ideal instrument for a beginner or a younger musician, simply because it is cost efficient, durable, and as easy to play for the price as one might be able to find anywhere"}
{"source": " Even experienced guitarists will almost certainly appreciate its action, sound and durability if not only for the purposes of practice and travel"}
{"source": " This is an exceptional value and an excellent instrument"}
{"source": "These strings fit the Bill perfectly for \"MY\" desired sound from a Yamaha LJ-16 Acoustic Guitar which has been \"Doctored\" with Bone Saddle, Pins and nut"}
{"source": " When I decided to put the money into the guitar, it was my belief that the Elixir Strings would continue to provide the sound and feel that I like so much in the LJ-16 and after all the work was completed"}
{"source": "that proved to be true to form"}
{"source": " I did move to the Medium for a little improvement from the Bass side and it's a most outstanding sound from a medium price, hand crafted guitar"}
{"source": " Elixir has the best (most comfortable) feel, to me, of all the strings that I've tested and these provide the best (for my liking) sound on this guitar"}
{"source": " Try them if it's quality sound that you're looking for"}
{"source": "These are great!!!!"}
{"source": "WAY better than stock strings that I received with my Fender acoustic"}
{"source": "  I am a beginner guitar player, but I was definitely able to hear a much brighter tone and it felt a little better on the fingers"}
{"source": "These strings are my second choice after the Elixir 80/20 Bronze"}
{"source": " They are warmer sounding, well balanced"}
{"source": " Cost a lot but well worth it to me"}
{"source": "Guess this was an open box or dented box but the stuff inside seemed ok"}
{"source": "  Will need to check them next week or so"}
{"source": "I have had a Korg CA-30 tuner for a few years which I really like"}
{"source": "I wanted to get a metronome and liked the idea of having a combined unit"}
{"source": "Initially I bought a Boss TU-80 for more money, but returned it because the response time and volume was not as good as the Korg TM-40,and the batteries rattled around in their compartment"}
{"source": "Also I like having the middle green LED for tuning"}
{"source": "The price here can't be beat and it's a well built item that works great"}
{"source": "I was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much, but they take more pressure that it would seem, and there is a delay until it turns on or off, so that turned out not to be an issue"}
{"source": "I am not real hot for the color, but it's nicely made and works well, so I will live with it"}
{"source": "I especially like the little folding stand in the back, rather than having to find an old credit card"}
{"source": "I have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome"}
{"source": "  I have another tuner, which is set EADGBE, that is much easy to tune without any confusion"}
{"source": " Although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently, it's confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left & right +/-20 or more"}
{"source": "  However, it's a bonus for using the tuner, and I don't have to bring all to the classes"}
{"source": "  For the metronome, which is my initial purpose to purchase it, it's great and have enough adjustable calibration, 13 beats, rhythms, and tempos for practices"}
{"source": "Got this tuner/metronome as a replacement for a tuner-only model"}
{"source": "  This is INCREDIBLY easy to use right out of the package"}
{"source": "  The tuner function indicates clearly whether you are sharp or flat (or amazingly in tune)"}
{"source": "  The metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions (eighth notes, sixteenths,etc)"}
{"source": "  For home and ensemble use, I personally couldn't ask for a better gadget for the price"}
{"source": "  Very happy with it!"}
{"source": "This little box is great for metronome use"}
{"source": " It is loud and the screen is easy to see"}
{"source": " The tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes"}
{"source": " It seems to work ok but the display might fluctuate from G to C when tuning to G on a Bass guitar"}
{"source": " I used it to set my intonation on a new Bass and it was well worth the price I paid"}
{"source": " I would buy another one if I lost this one"}
{"source": "I really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs"}
{"source": " I just miss the \"mecanical\" click of a mechanic metronome"}
{"source": " The rest is just great"}
{"source": " i've bought a cable which allows me to connect the metronome to my line6 amp and the result is much much better"}
{"source": "I am quite pleased with this product"}
{"source": " It's relatively inexpensive, small and light weight"}
{"source": "  It operates on two AA batteries (included)"}
{"source": " I use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate"}
{"source": "  The LED and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily"}
{"source": " I should have ordered the CM-100 clip-on tuner at the same time (placed a separate order later) to allow to tune in a noisy music (jam or band) environment"}
{"source": " You can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings"}
{"source": " There is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches"}
{"source": " The metronome is pretty loud for the small size"}
{"source": " I have a hearing loss, so if I can hear it, even while playing, it must be pretty good"}
{"source": "  The speeds are from 40-208 BPM"}
{"source": " You can select between two modes PENDULUM STEP (Preset values, 40,42,44---88,92,96, etc) or FULL STEP which allows you to change incrementally by one (40, 41, 42---206, 207, 208, etc)"}
{"source": " Beat tap allows you change the time signature from 0-7 beats and also duplets, triplets, quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats"}
{"source": " It has a 1/8\" mini earphone jack for private use"}
{"source": " It is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously"}
{"source": " I bought mine from Austin Bazaar"}
{"source": "  Shipping was FREE and FAST"}
{"source": " I give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration"}
{"source": "This device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone (sounds like a 1980's video game beep) but I am just being picky"}
{"source": " I bought this for my son and he loves it"}
{"source": "Pros: It's a good tuner, it's a good metronome, and it's a great combination package"}
{"source": " The flip-out stand on the back makes it easier to see than when it's lying flat"}
{"source": " The metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program"}
{"source": "Cons: the buttons on the front are raised on top of other raised areas, and it's too easy to accidentally turn the unit on"}
{"source": " The tuning sound activated once in my pocket while I was sitting in the audience at a band contest"}
{"source": " Also, unlike the CA-30 tuner, this one favors higher notes strongly over bass and makes it difficult to tune low instruments in a noisy environment"}
{"source": "Also, it quit working suddenly after about a year"}
{"source": " Other people I know who've had this tuner have complained about lack of durability"}
{"source": "Works well since I got it"}
{"source": " I didn't change battery for more than 6 months"}
{"source": "Tuner works as it should-- almost a little too precisely (it's pretty sensitive)"}
{"source": "The metronome will drive you crazy"}
{"source": "  It has various beats which is a nice touch, but the sounds are horrible"}
{"source": "  Think of the most sterile electronic clicks/beeps you can and then add nails-on-chalkboard for good measure"}
{"source": "  There are much better sounding metronomes out there"}
{"source": "  I bought this Korg for the tuner function and that's about all I'll use it for"}
{"source": "Dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years"}
{"source": "  I think that I can safely say that the basic design looks to be amazingly similar to what I remember when I saw these for the first time in my university days of the late 1970s"}
{"source": "  Generally, Dampits can be used over and over for years"}
{"source": "  Sometimes the rubber becomes discolored, sometimes the rubber rips near the end of the Dampit, but basically this is a very workable way to maintain at least a minimum amount of humidity in and around your instrument, something that is especially important during the winter months when artificial heat zaps the humidity out of the air"}
{"source": "  This is the first instrument-specific Dampit product that I've ever purchased and it seems to work exceptionally well"}
{"source": "  In addition to the standard Dampit, there's a sound-hole cover"}
{"source": "  In case it is not clear just how it works, the clear sound-hole cover has a short string with a loop on the end"}
{"source": "  You simply attach the Dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar"}
{"source": "  My first impression is that it does an excellent job of keeping some needed humidity in the body of the instrument, something very important on a solid-top classical guitar"}
{"source": "  I would recommend this over the standard Dampit because the sound-hole cover is so convenient (hopefully it will continue to keep me from having to fish around inside the guitar for a runaway Dampit) and seems to keep the humidity focused in an area that is especially in need of it"}
{"source": "  A must have if you keep your acoustic guitar in an environment that gets much below 40-50% humidity"}
{"source": "It's hard to really describe what this pedal does-  It doesn't distort, flange, echo, or produce a chorus"}
{"source": "  I'd heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it"}
{"source": "  And because words don't do an accurate job in describing it, I would have probably never pulled the trigger on one (even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go)"}
{"source": "  As luck would have it, I acquired one on trade, and I have to admit that I agree with the whole blanket euphemism"}
{"source": "  This stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my Blues Jr"}
{"source": " when placed at the end of my pedaltrain- right before I run into the amp"}
{"source": " I don't feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp's tone, though I do believe it works even better in a loop"}
{"source": "  I placed it in the effects loop of both a Palomino V8 (USA/Ampeg made) and a Crate VC508 (a 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amp with Celestian speaker) and it was transformative to both amps' tone (in a great way)"}
{"source": " It does very well with single coils"}
{"source": "  It's a pedal that I would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in"}
{"source": "  I don't think it works as well when I run my LP into a Jet City combo - particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures / harmonics"}
{"source": " That amp also lacks an effects loop and I imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase"}
{"source": "  I guess it's rig dependent, but it's a keeper for what it does to the sound of my Fender"}
{"source": "This is a great pedal to put at the end of your FX chain"}
{"source": " I have it as the last on my pedalboard before my GNX4"}
{"source": " It's always on & it only took me about a week to settle on how I liked it adjusted"}
{"source": " There are only two knobs & I just played around with them untill I was happy with the sound"}
{"source": " I do a lot of recording & I also checked the sound after recording"}
{"source": " Can't reccomend it enough especially considering the price"}
{"source": "I like it"}
{"source": " This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments"}
{"source": " Like all other pedals, it's not \"The Pedal\" (seems like you always need another one)"}
{"source": " But it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone"}
{"source": " After you've settle on a setting you like, it adds a subtle, but noticeable addition to your sound"}
{"source": "This pedal essentialy balances out the high, mid, and low frequencies yout instrument produces"}
{"source": " I also have the software version of this effect on my DAW"}
{"source": " This pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone"}
{"source": " When I switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier"}
{"source": " I highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians"}
{"source": "For those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky, bitey blues material (think Albert Collins), this will likely add a little, and I mean A LITTLE, extra oomph to your sound"}
{"source": " It sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling"}
{"source": " But you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just running it straight"}
{"source": "To me, from what I have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music"}
{"source": " It definitely doesn't add any more fatness"}
{"source": " So my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased Vitamin E regimen"}
{"source": " In other words, this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you are"}
{"source": "Most musicians already use EQ and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think you're getting out of this pedal, I think"}
{"source": "I'm not going to do any explaining about the \"science\" behind how this pedal works"}
{"source": " I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone"}
{"source": " This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal"}
{"source": " To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone"}
{"source": " Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing"}
{"source": "The lo contour knob doesn't \"increase\" the amount of bass produced by the amp"}
{"source": " Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone"}
{"source": " To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't"}
{"source": " You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp"}
{"source": "The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies"}
{"source": " These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh"}
{"source": "That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better"}
{"source": "Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect"}
{"source": " At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off"}
{"source": " With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a \"night and day\" difference"}
{"source": "I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better"}
{"source": " This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack"}
{"source": " It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before"}
{"source": "In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the \"must have\" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone"}
{"source": " This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones"}
{"source": "This pedal adds that \"I don't know what\" to your sound"}
{"source": "I chased a sound for years until buying this pedal - what a difference"}
{"source": "If you have great, top quality cable, quiet amps and pedal boards, shielded guitars, fresh tubes - you know the drill - you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head - then you plug one pedal in and WHAMO!! - there it is!It was THIS pedal for me - just turn the knobs until \"it\" comes out of your speakers"}
{"source": "A must have - especially if you are playing clubs, bars or arenas - you have a pedal board - and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front - give your notes clarity during leads - make overdriven chords ring"}
{"source": "I like this pedal - it's on my board - and it's never coming off"}
{"source": "Just got my stand today"}
{"source": " the QUICKEST delivery EVER with the Super Savings free shipping selected that I have ever experienced!  Go go, Amazon!  lulz  Anyhoo, I have two banjos and a mandolin that I purchased this for"}
{"source": "  I looked about for quite a bit at various sites, reviews, prices, etc, and pretty much Hercules got the best reviews everywhere (although admittedly I hadn't really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars)"}
{"source": "  Yet this tri-stand really looked good with a solid general review, and I am rather tight for space overall (think trailer home size)"}
{"source": "  I wanted a way to hold my instruments in one place without having to work around gig-bags or hard cases taking up limited 'living space'"}
{"source": " As it stands (figuratively and literally), the Hercules Tri-Stand does the job excellently with the two banjos"}
{"source": "  All three instruments are varying heights, the resonator bluegrass banjo being the longest, and (naturally) the mandolin being the shortest, with a open back clawhammer banjo in the middle"}
{"source": "The three 'back-rest' fold outs are static, attached to a center ring, and you \"can\" adjust them independently a *little up and down*, but not to compensate for such a length difference between a bluegrass banjo and a mandolin"}
{"source": "  However, the mandolin is a really lite thing, so I suspect it will be fine just hanging there by the peg head without a 'back-rest' as long as the stand isn't jostled around"}
{"source": "  In my own case, aside from two rather lazy cats and pending no sudden hip-smash-oops by me, that shouldn't be an issue"}
{"source": "  And of course, considering I am looking at a possible third banjo, the mandolin may just go live in its case after all"}
{"source": "Now a word about open back banjos, if you are considering this stand"}
{"source": " First off, no, I was not going to rest the coordinator rod against the 'back-rest' (just seems like a bad idea)"}
{"source": "  What I ended up doing was adjusting the 'back-rests' so the resonator of the bluegrass banjo rested about an inch up from the bottom, allowing the open back to rest on the other side ON TOP of the rest, along the lip of the banjo rim, at the edge of the rest foam where it begins to curve out and down"}
{"source": " The tail-piece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing"}
{"source": "  Seems pretty solid in this position while still engaging the weight clamps up at the top"}
{"source": "I give it 5 stars mainly based on the excellent quality of the stand and the fact that it is the ONLY three instrument stand worth any kind of hoot I have been able to find"}
{"source": "  Its not the absolute perfect thing for my own application (would need the three 'back-rests' to be independently adjustable in height for that), but overall I am extremely pleased with it"}
{"source": "If you are like me and truly value your (usually) expensive prized instruments, then you want to make sure nothing happens to them, accidentally or otherwise"}
{"source": " The Hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest"}
{"source": " They have a better base design, and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling, no worries - just make sure you lower it all the way, as it is designed to be"}
{"source": "These things are awesome"}
{"source": " Also, everything fits so perfectly on Hercules stands"}
{"source": " All of the other tri-stands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together"}
{"source": " Not here, plenty of room for everything now"}
{"source": " This stand (and the double version which I also own) lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture"}
{"source": " Also, the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet"}
{"source": " With all other stands I am always worried that my guitar will slide off, or if it gets bumped that it could fall out"}
{"source": " This mechanism holds it tight until you want it, and releases it very easily and naturally for you, but will not let it go while it's just sitting there"}
{"source": " Check these things out, you will not be disappointed"}
{"source": "Also, as for durability, I have used and abused my Hercules stand for years, tossing it around my car to play at different places"}
{"source": " It's been tossed, dropped, setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when I first bought it"}
{"source": " It doesn't even have any obvious visible scratches on it (it came with a bag but I discarded it and never used it)"}
{"source": " Meanwhile, I had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before I bought the Herc"}
{"source": " I will only every buy Herc stands from now on"}
{"source": "This is one of the cleanest sounding mini-amps you'll find"}
{"source": "  Mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones"}
{"source": "  It uses JFET components which get close to a tube amp sound"}
{"source": "  It does sound tinny through the 2\" speaker, but AM radio sounded just as bad through 2\" speakers"}
{"source": "  I hated it at first until I plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the O"}
{"source": " Drive knob"}
{"source": "  Very clean but I could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar's volume knob"}
{"source": "  Turning the O"}
{"source": "Drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle"}
{"source": "  Of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp"}
{"source": "  I'm building a speaker cab with a Jensen 6\" speaker just for this amp"}
{"source": "  According to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab"}
{"source": "This is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier"}
{"source": " The controls are Volume/ off, Tone, and overdrive"}
{"source": " It also has a headphone jack"}
{"source": " In my honest opinion, it is a good headphone amplifier to use when to need to practice without disturbing people around you"}
{"source": " The speaker sound is fine for a clean sound ( like jazz, or country) or semi distorted and more (rock)"}
{"source": " If your looking for an small amp"}
{"source": " that will do metal this may not be for you"}

{"source": "  First, let's not expect $500 double 16&#34; sound from a portable 9v amp"}
{"source": "  Once that reality is recognized, it's realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price"}
{"source": "I would note that the sound you get out of this amp-- as with any amp-- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you're feeding from"}
{"source": "  I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different"}
{"source": "  One had very rich tone, another sounded &#34;tinny&#34;, another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup"}
{"source": "  So it won't sound the same on every guitar"}
{"source": "That said, if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good, this amp is simply awesome"}
{"source": "  I've had it only one day so I haven't put it through the test of time"}
{"source": " but first-impressions are that I will buy more of these in the future (I need more than one portable amp)"}
{"source": "My sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box, and she was impressed as well"}
{"source": "  Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp"}

{"source": "  I like the small size that won't take too much space on my tiny room, it's cute to look at, and it is practical too!I had the high frequence of feedback as one of the reviwers when I used a poor pickup; however, when I changed to another one, I can turn the volume as high as I want with the same direction and setup as the previous poor pickup"}
{"source": "  I almost thought that was an issue from the amp, luckily, I have two different pickups to try it deeply"}
{"source": "  After using the better pickup, the amp doesn't have any issue yet"}
{"source": "  I have used for few times, so I don't know about its longevity yet!One more thing about the headphone mode that is not completely silent because the guitar's sound itself won't be muted, but the headphone does mute the effected sounds from the amp; anyway, it's a great feature to have"}
{"source": "I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over-drive"}
{"source": " I love it"}
{"source": " It's got tone galore! I play either a Martin A/E thru it or a Strat knock-off"}
{"source": "  Either one sounds awesome"}
{"source": "  Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20"}

{"source": "  $20 is pocket change"}
{"source": "i knew it would be small but i wasn't thinking this small, ,it shore is cute,, good enough for now ,but not for the long-run,, shore its loud for the size but, it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides  from vibration,,if you keep it on lower sound its fine, this is only for temporary use for me"}
{"source": " its an ok tiny mini little amp  (for it's size its good,) don't exspect a fender amp thats all,"}
{"source": "Based on other reviews, I made my purchase"}
{"source": " This is a great unit, it sounds good and loud enough"}
{"source": "Two downsides, both are about the noise"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " I live on the 4th floor"}
{"source": " As long as I turn the volume up, it acts like a radio"}
{"source": " I mean very loud radio background and I couldn't get ride of it"}
{"source": " This is the only thing that annoys me, but I think it depends on where people live"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " When this is not properly tuned, it sounds strange and makes a lot of noise"}
{"source": " (Other than the radio part"}
{"source": ")None of these are major issues, as a mini amp you can't really expect that much, not to mention it's not expensive at all"}
{"source": " Overall I like it and I would recommend it"}
{"source": "By the way, this unit comes with a 9V battery"}
{"source": "Sounds a lot more than what you expect, this is my 2nd Honeytone (one at home, one at work)"}
{"source": "  You can use it with batteries or with a 9V adapter, it has a clip to hang it on your belt or wherever you want, it also has a headphones input"}
{"source": "  It gets way to distorted at high volume, but come on"}
{"source": " it's a $20 amp; it does what it has to and does it well"}
{"source": "It's not going to win any awards for sound quality, but it sure is cute"}
{"source": "  As you might expect, it's a pretty boxy sounding little amp, more reminiscent of 60's portable transistor radios than a double stack Marshall"}
{"source": "  But it did the two things I wanted it for"}
{"source": "  First, it has a belt clip, which I can attach to my belt or a guitar strap"}
{"source": "  Second, it has a headphone out, so I can plug in a set of ear buds (1/8&#34; stereo jack)"}
{"source": "  You can get it to a clean decent practice room level if you keep the drive control set at minimum"}
{"source": "  Surprisingly, the Drive control works it's way in gradually, letting you control the distortion a bit with the guitar volume control"}
{"source": " With the drive control cranked up, you can get the amp unexpectedly loud, but terribly distorted"}
{"source": "  For something you can throw in your guitar gig bag and take with you wherever you go, it's not too bad"}
{"source": "  With a set of earphones, I would put it on par with some of the more expensive amp-jacks that are available"}
{"source": "  If you plan to use it as a practice amp and you're not moving about, I would recommend getting a power supply (will use the same ones as most effects pedals)"}
{"source": "  Battery life appears to be around 3~5 hours, but the performance starts degrading at about an hour's use"}
{"source": "Don't get me wrong"}
{"source": "this is a great little amp for practicing"}
{"source": "but it eats batteries like they were candy"}
{"source": " I think it was like 2 or three hours of playing and I had to throw in new batteries"}
{"source": " But if playing on the street corner is your thing"}
{"source": "this little amp has a belt clip"}
{"source": "This micro amp is a real blast in more ways than one"}
{"source": " And it is NOT a toy"}
{"source": " Don't be misled by the price--this is a real amp based on stompbox electronics, and while it may not be a Marshall stack, it is more than adequate as a highly portable practice amp as well as a performance amp for small spaces"}
{"source": " It is certainly loud hough to evoke complaints from my neighbors in adjoining apartments"}
{"source": "I bought this amp for use durng harmonica practice"}
{"source": " To this end, I use the belt clip to mount it on my hip"}
{"source": " Then I just patch in my mike, twiddle the controls, and go to town"}
{"source": " The tone has been fairly pure although, with a mike at least, I can also get some pops, crackles, and squeals"}
{"source": " This is pretty typical for anyone amping a harp, so the Honey Tone is not at fault"}
{"source": " In general, this amp is pretty forgiving of the input"}
{"source": " I've used it with a high-impedance mike (Astatic JT-30), a low-impedance mike (Behringer XM8500), and electric guitar (Fender Stratocaster)"}
{"source": " It handles these without noticeable signal loss"}
{"source": "What is this amp exactly? My guess is that Danelectric took the circuitry for its overdrive stompbox, added a 1-watt amplifier circuit, and put the whole shebang into a retro case"}
{"source": " The result is quite appealing"}
{"source": " And the overall look and feel is one of quality"}
{"source": " The case is solid albeit plastic"}
{"source": " The three controls (volume, tone, and overdrive), while not detented, have the smooth control that you tend to get on better components"}
{"source": " The input 1/4-inch jack and the mini jack headphone output are all solid"}
{"source": " Someone in Danelectric had a sense of humor in touting the unit's \"leather\" strap, though"}
{"source": " It is more decorative than useful"}
{"source": "If you can operate an overdrive stompbox, then you know how to work this amp"}
{"source": " The volume control is obvious"}
{"source": " The tone control alters the bass/treble mix (but not very significantly, in my opinion)"}
{"source": " The overdrive control adds fuzz and distortion (again, not to a great degree)"}
{"source": " The instructions describe 16 \"sounds,\" but someone in Danelectric has a sense of humor"}
{"source": " Otherwise, why label one setting \"Send the cats under the bed"}
{"source": "\" Ignore the instructions and set the controls to whatever sounds good to you"}
{"source": "As I said, this is small but really not a toy"}
{"source": " I've personally found it very useful in practicing blues harp because it's so easy to set up and so ridiculously portable"}
{"source": " And when I decide that I'm good enough to panhandle in Penn Station, this baby is going with me"}
{"source": "I cant tell you how impressed i am with this mini amp, I was expecting some little amp with a somewhat of a sound, Instead I couldn't put it away, I must have played for at least a couple of hours in complete awe, The tones you were able to achieve with just a little knob adjustment was amazing,I would recommend this to anyone that needs a cheap amp, The 9v battery holds up well (which is surprising considering the drive you got off it)So spend the $20"}
{"source": "00 and get something that is a real deal, I hope this helps with your decision about purchasing one"}
{"source": "I don't have a classical guitar, but I just got an inexpensive but really fun steel string guitar with a non-radiused fingerboard"}
{"source": "  I've also got over a dozen capos (don't ask!) but all are for radiused fingerboards"}
{"source": "The fingerboards of most steel-string guitars--electric and acoustic--are radiused, that is, they are not flat"}
{"source": "  They have a gentle curve to them, so gentle that many wouldn't notice it unless they looked closely"}
{"source": " Look up \"fingerboard\" in the Wikipedia for an excellent discussion and Google images for diagrams and pictures"}
{"source": "Even though the curve is gentle, if a fingerboard is radiused, a capo must be curved, too, or the outside strings would not be pressed down properly and would buzz"}
{"source": "  If a fingerboard is flat, like a classical guitar's, the capo must be flat, too, or the center strings will not be pressed down properly and will buzz"}
{"source": "If you're not sure whether your guitar's fingerboard is radiused, slide a ruler between two frets"}
{"source": "  If it lies flat, then so is the fingerboard"}
{"source": "  If it rocks, the fingerboard is radiused"}
{"source": "I REALLY like this capo because of the way pressure is adjusted by turning the tension screw"}
{"source": "  This makes it possible to exert just the right amount of pressure--not tool little, which would cause strings to buzz, and not too much, which would cause the instrument to go out of tune"}
{"source": "As others have noted, its one drawback is that it can't be clamped to the headstock when not in use"}
{"source": "  But for that, I'd replace most of my capos with radiused versions of this capo"}
{"source": "  HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"source": "The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not \"lite\",  I prefer that one above this model"}
{"source": "A Little History:I have been a guitar player for forty-odd (some of them, VERY odd) years"}
{"source": "  For the first thirty of them, I tuned by ear - starting by guessing at what a low E sounded like, then tuning the other five strings by fretting, listening and tuning"}
{"source": "  I could never understand why the tuning often sounded perfect for one chord, yet remained `off' for others"}
{"source": " it took quite a long time to get it right"}
{"source": "  Then, about ten years ago, I thought I had figured it out"}
{"source": "  The problem (I thought) was that my guesses at a true \"E\" were off - so I got myself an \"E\" tuning fork (320 cycles) and used it to tune the first string"}
{"source": "  Then, I did as I had always done - fretted and tuned the other five"}
{"source": " Not much better as a result - kept having to tune and retune for quite a while to get all chords to sound right"}
{"source": "  During those years, I tried tuning all six strings to (what I believed was an accurately tuned) piano as well as by ear to tones available online"}
{"source": "  Nothing gave me better tuning on the first try"}
{"source": "  Then, I saw an ad for a Chromatic Tuner and lightening struck"}
{"source": "The Realization:There have been many -  each of which has led me closer to what I have now - near perfect tuning on the first go `round!  First off, I realized that when we say \"E\", that is not just one note"}
{"source": "  It is a range of literally hundreds - perhaps even thousands- of specific tones"}
{"source": "  The same is true for every note"}
{"source": "  This is akin, I guess, to the realization as a child, that no matter how many shades of `blue' are in a box of crayons, the chanced of having the precise shade you want for a specific drawing are rare"}
{"source": "  Purchasing my first Chromatic Tuner (a CT440, manufactured by SwitchMucic and sold through MusiciansFriend"}
{"source": "com) moved me a long way along the continuum of learning and accurate tuning"}
{"source": "  However, that tuner had at least two limitations"}
{"source": " Firstly, it's construction is rather light and flimsy - it works OK, but has a second limitation that conaused me to buy the Korg (for about the same price)  That is that the Korg has a built in tone generator and speaker allowing the option of tuning that way rather than having only the single option of having tones made by the instrument read and metered back to you"}
{"source": "  Both tuners have plug-in for electric instruments, and, so far as I can tell, their accuracies are similar"}
{"source": "  I prefer the Korg for the reasons I have mentioned"}
{"source": "  Additionally, the Korg can be manually recalibrated for special tuning needs - and `remembers' the original tuning/tones so you can return to it for more `standard' usage"}
{"source": " A nice, extra piece of flexibility"}
{"source": " The LCD meter is easy to read and colored lights tell you, right away, whether you are sharp, flat (and by how much!) or right on!As a point of surprising interest, the tuning fork I had used for years turns out to be profoundly FLAT! A shock to me - given that I had grown up learning that tuning forks gave off perfect tones! I have saved it as a reminder that all things are not what they are promoted to be"}
{"source": " I guess the round pitch pipe that Ms"}
{"source": " Sweeny used to tune up the class in the 5th grade was probably not quite as precise as she would have presumed!And Finally:This is a marvelous little (and inexpensive) device - well constructed, accurate and flexible to allow for many different tuning need situations and circumstances"}
{"source": "  I assume that there will be still higher places for my `learning curve' in this area to rise to - but for right now, this is it"}
{"source": "  I am using it, regularly, on all my stringed instruments (two six-string Martins, a twelve string Epiphone and a frailing banjo"}
{"source": "  The time it saves tuning the 12-string alone makes it more than it's own price!)If you have not discovered Chromatic Tuning (maybe I really WAS the last one to discover these things!?), I suggest you do so immediately and spend your time enjoying the pleasures of making music rather than sitting in frustration trying to adjust the tunings by ear so it sounds `really' right"}
{"source": " Perhaps people with `perfect pitch' can do very nicely without a Chromatic Tuner - I am not one of them"}
{"source": " Are you?"}
{"source": "This is a nice little tuner"}
{"source": " It is small, easy to read and use"}
{"source": " It has a non-backlit LCD display of an analog VU style meter, with extra marks at plus and minus 20 cents, and red LEDs that light when a tone is sharp or flat"}
{"source": " It has a green LED and large mark for being on target"}
{"source": " It has a built-in mic for acoustic instruments, and a mono 1/4 inch phone jack for electric instruments"}
{"source": " It has an active tone you can switch on for tuning, but that is only adjustable over the narrow range of 410-480hz"}
{"source": " It uses a pair of AAA size batteries that you pop the whole case open to change"}
{"source": " If you have any vision problems, the display might be an issue"}
{"source": " The LCD is about 1 1/2 inches long and 3/4 of an inch high, and, like all non-backlit LCD displays, has a narrow viewing angle and reflection issues"}
{"source": "I wanted this for tuning didgeridus that I was making, and it works adequately for that"}
{"source": " The one thing it is lacking that disappointed me is a frequency or octave readout"}
{"source": " As it is, it gives you the note and cents sharp or flat, but does not give an octave number or frequency of the sound"}
{"source": " So, you know you are tuned to a C, you just don't know exactly which C it is"}
{"source": " Probably not much of an issue if you are tuning a regular instrument, but in some cases would be very handy to know"}
{"source": " I suppose with more training and experience, I could learn to tell that by ear"}
{"source": " (What? Learn a skill! Isn't that asking a bit much?)I suppose for an inexpensive tuner, that is the trade-off, but it does detract from the usefulness of this tuner for my purposes"}
{"source": " Other than that, it seems to work well"}
{"source": " It is consistent, easy to use, and compact"}
{"source": " I consider it about average in value - it does the basics well but is missing what I consider an important function in such a device"}
{"source": " I may be expecting too much for the price, as I have not done an exhaustive study of tuners and their specs"}
{"source": " Having the octave feature would make it 4 stars for me instead of three"}
{"source": "In any case, if you don't need to know the actual octave or frequency but just the accuracy of the notes you are tuning, this works quite well, and is not very expensive"}
{"source": "I've had two of these tuners"}
{"source": " They are well known among bass instrument players for being able to lock in on the lowest pitches better than most other tuners"}
{"source": " They're durable and have a long battery life"}
{"source": " Unlike most other tuners, in noisy environments they don't lock in on higher pitches before lower ones, again a plus for low instrument players"}
{"source": "The one problem that I've had with these tuners is that one of them had to be set to A-439 to tune pitches that other tuners recognized as A=440"}

{"source": "It has a comfortable seat and seems stable and well-made"}
{"source": "  However, if you need to haul it around frequently, it takes a bit of time to set up and screw down or open up the screws that hold the moving stability bar on the bottom of the seat"}

{"source": "2x Thicker padding than the Epiphone gig bag I got for the LP, but all these have to do is protect and keep dust away - I'm not hauling them to shows"}
{"source": "Get One"}
{"source": "Nice bag with great features"}
{"source": " It is slightly large for a Telecaster or Stratocaster but works fine for either"}
{"source": "I actually swapped another bag, putting a Les Paul Jr in this one and a Tele in the Gibson bag as theGibson bag was a really tight fit for the LP JR"}
{"source": " headstock"}
{"source": "I am deployed to middle east and beat my guitars up pretty good"}
{"source": "  I have 3 World Tour bags to keep my axes safe!  Nice padding, nice features"}
{"source": "This is a great gig bag for the money"}
{"source": " It has more padding than I thought it would have, has very strong construction, and plenty of places to store stuff like sheet music and cables"}
{"source": " The carry handle and shoulder straps are well padded and comfortable to use as well"}
{"source": " It's even reasonably water proof, handling the light rain shower well with zero leaks"}
{"source": " For the money, this is the best one I've bought on Amazon, and will certainly buy it again in the future"}
{"source": " Highly recommended!"}
{"source": "I have an ESP guitar with a slanted headstock that had a hard time fitting into the gig bag that the music store threw in when I got the guitar"}
{"source": " After buying a line-6 pocket pod and some good studio headphones there was simply no room left in that old bag"}
{"source": "Found this bag and liked the fact that it has so many front pockets and it really looked like it would fit all of my gear, cables, etc"}
{"source": " I originally put it on my wish list because I will admit, you don't always want to spend your own money on stuff like this but my wife ended up surprising me with this and it was a great surprise"}
{"source": "My guitar fits perfectly"}
{"source": " It used to be a struggle getting my guitar in the old gig bag and zipping it shut"}
{"source": " As mentioned, the curved headstock makes the guitar taller and the old gig bag always had the pointed tip of the headstock poking out of it because it just would not close"}
{"source": "But this big closes all the way and it does have so much more padding than my previous bag"}
{"source": " And the pockets - OH THE POCKETS! They fit ALL of my gear"}
{"source": " I have my guitar cable, a set of full size sennheiser headphones, a line 6 pocket pod, all the allen wrenches, a tuner, and my tremelo neatly organized in all the separate pockets"}
{"source": " And there is room for more if I need it!The bag does smell a little funky the first few days but it didn't stink up the house like some reviewers mentioned"}
{"source": " Just open it up and let it air out in a part of the house where it won't bother anyone and it's fine after a day or two"}
{"source": "One last thing about this bag is that it has a handle right up near the headstock"}
{"source": " I did not know this but wow I had no idea how useful that could be"}
{"source": " I tend to carry my guitar, in bag, up and down stairs a lot and being able to hold it in two places is extremely useful"}
{"source": " Then you have the backpack handles as an option as well"}
{"source": " I really cannot recommend this bag enough"}
{"source": " I do agree with the other user who said the log on it is a little kiddie like, but I don't really care, the bag is too perfect for me to be bothered by that, and while the padding is great, I would not recommend this bag for checking your bag for air travel"}
{"source": " It would be fine if you use it as a carry on but would not protect much in checked baggage, in case you want it for that kind of thing"}
{"source": " I don't travel long distances with my guitar but if I did, I would use a hard case only for that as I have seen too many horror stories of smashed guitars on airlines lately"}
{"source": "Hope that helps anyone out there looking for a gig bag with tons of room for your gear!"}
{"source": "This bag is well padded, has backpack straps to carry comfortable, and several pockets to hold cable, extra strings, picks, and much, much more"}
{"source": " For the price, I feel like it is a steal"}
{"source": " Some people complain about the smell"}
{"source": " It kind of smells like motor oil"}
{"source": " It is strange, but being I have been around that smell so much, it doesn't bother me"}
{"source": " Be warned about it though"}
{"source": "Got this for an SG-style guitar, and it fits with plenty of room"}
{"source": "  This is a better quality bag than an &#34;average&#34; bag, but with a couple of comments:1"}
{"source": "  It smells like an industrial rubber factory upon opening"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": "  The large, main zipper is easy to close but somewhat difficult to unzip"}
{"source": "  Surprised me because it's a large-toothed zipper"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": "  Construction seems to be pretty good"}
{"source": "  This is not a hard case, but to get a guitar from point A to B, it works just fine"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": "  Padding is sufficiently thick"}
{"source": "  It's not a paper thin bag, but it's not thick enough that the guitar would survive a drop"}
{"source": "Would I get another one?  Probably, as long as the use was long term storage or to travel small distances"}
{"source": "  Otherwise, I'd get a soft sided hard case (the new wave of Styrofoam cases) or a regular old hard sided case"}
{"source": "I have seven of these that I use on my Ibanez AM73's, but they are perfect for anyAM series guitars (like the 93)"}
{"source": "The bag is well padded, and not to expensive"}
{"source": "It seems it is always on back order which tells me they are very popular"}
{"source": "The dimensions are: 41\"L, 14\"W at Bout, and 3\" Deep"}
{"source": " It has two large zippers; the head zipper goes all the wayaround, and the bout zipper stops before entering the bottom area which is the ONLY draw back to thisgig bag, as with ALL deeper guitars, you want the bottom (bout) zipper to at least complete the bottom areato make placing and removing easier"}
{"source": "This is the best gig bag I have found in the last few years for the smaller bout guitars that does not cost too much"}
{"source": "This is a great bag, regardless of cost"}
{"source": " The fact that it sells for less than $20 makes it an absolutely fantastic deal"}
{"source": " (Free shipping only makes it that much better"}
{"source": ") Unlike some other reviewers, I have not noticed any objectionable smell"}
{"source": " I will attest to the fact that it is very well constructed"}
{"source": " The fabric itself is a heavy cordura material, the zippers and pulls are heavy duty too, and the padding is stiff and thick enough to afford your (solid body) guitar some very substantial protection"}
{"source": " (I would estimate the padding, which is entirely concealed within the cordura, to be approximately three-quarters of an inch thick"}
{"source": ") In addition to the main carry handle at the side, there is another in back, at the top, as well a pair of backpack-style straps, so finding a convenient means of carrying your guitar shouldn't be any kind of an issue"}
{"source": " The two zippered accessory pouches (for picks, a spare set of strings, and perhaps some music) are also a nice touch"}
{"source": " In my opinion, this bag could easily sell for twice the price and still be considered a bargain"}
{"source": " As it is, it's very cheap insurance for my Epi Les Paul II"}
{"source": "I bought a Pedaltrain pedal board and I have 6 individual stomp boxes that are crammed onto it"}
{"source": " I originally bought Hosa connectors and they are high quality and have a low profile, but the selection of lengths is limited"}
{"source": " I bought this kit with a little trepidation and proceeded to re-do the board"}
{"source": " I swear I was done in 20 minutes!! The board looks awesome with all the cables cut to perfect length"}
{"source": " These cables are dead silent and the connectors are high quality"}
{"source": " The supplied cutting tool works as described and the only thing you need is a small-tip, flathead screwdriver with a medium size handle so you can firmly drive the locking screw into the cable for the final step"}
{"source": " I could have saved some money if I had just bought these first instead of a bunch of random length patch cables"}
{"source": "The good thing about the Cable Station is you can make your own cables at custom lengths so you can have a neater pedal board without the need to solder the connections in place"}
{"source": " All you have to do is cut the cable flush, insert it into the \" plug with a twisting motion, and then turn the setscrew on the side of the plug until it is tight"}
{"source": "As a benefit, if there is a shorting of the signal all you need to do is find the offending cable, remove the plug, cut the cable, and insert the end back into the plug"}
{"source": "Great right?Well, not really"}
{"source": "As far as reliability goes, nothing can really replace the connection that is properly soldered"}
{"source": " With the money you spend, you could easily get a decent soldering iron, some old cable, and some cheap plugs from Radio Shack and practice"}
{"source": " In the end, you can by bulk cable and connectors and make them as needed"}
{"source": "I have used this product and had to re-cut several cables at different times but only to cables that have been constantly moved around"}
{"source": " The other ones that are more permanent haves not given me trouble, but I have experienced problems in the past"}
{"source": " Always have a few spares that have been tested"}
{"source": "Another annoying thing is that they give you more cable than connectors, I would think 15 connectors would be more sufficient"}
{"source": "Is it easier than soldering? Yes"}
{"source": "Are they reliable? For the most part, yes"}
{"source": "Will I continue using the product? Yes, because I usually have spares"}
{"source": "Why do I use them then? I'm lazy"}
{"source": "This is from the Cleartone cables website about gold connectors:Don"}
{"source": "t waste your money if you are being asked to pay extra for gold plated connectors"}
{"source": " The thin soft gold (5-10 microns) "}
{"source": "flash"}
{"source": " plating looks cool, but scrapes off easily and the brass aterial underneath stops you from seeing that the gold has worn off! The brass eventually  tarnishes and causes crackling when the plug moves or twists in the socket contacts"}
{"source": "It is true that gold is a very good conductor of electricity when mated with a gold plated socket"}
{"source": " But the sockets inside your guitar amplifier and guitar are not usually gold, so there can be virtually no benefit to gold plated plugs"}
{"source": "I am a tech as well as a guitar player"}
{"source": " I also have spent time in the past Teaching soldering"}
{"source": " But these cables seem to be well made with good solderless connections"}
{"source": " Most of us know by now that there's a lot of hype but it really comes down to Good Quality Cable (This Seems to be) Good Stable Connectors (These seem to be) & the connections between the two that last (Time will tell)"}
{"source": " All I know is I have Hand Soldered Special plugs with Good Cable to only have them break with use and I expect the same with these especially in a high use situation where they are plugged & unplugged often"}
{"source": "- I do know these are signal clean & do Not bleed f highs & that is critical in my book"}
{"source": "- They are Very Easy to use & can be done on Stage between or before sets very quickly and with NO Soldering & I Love that!I will definitely use these again unless I find a longevity problem"}
{"source": "LM"}
{"source": "I bought this to replace a folding stand that was just not strong enough to hold up under the weight of some of my guitar books"}
{"source": " This stand works great for me, and hold even the largest of my music and tab books"}
{"source": "The construction is much better than other portable stands I've used in the past, and has two great features that I really appreciate"}
{"source": " One is it's height adjustable, and two is the tilting head"}
{"source": " The tilting head is a real bonous on a portable stnad, and this one works great"}
{"source": "For the price this stand is a great buy that I would recommend to anyone, but being primarily a guitarist this stand is execptional"}
{"source": " With the page holders tilting head and height adjustability this is one of the best stand purchases a guitarist can make"}
{"source": "As a newbie violin student I needed a music stand"}
{"source": "  Having purchased many things before through Amazon"}
{"source": "com, I have learned to trust the customer reviews which get posted (remembering that there will always be a few cranks)"}
{"source": "  This music stand got good reviews and I can say that I too am very happy with it"}
{"source": "  I would recommend this purchase to any one"}
{"source": "I have been using Hercos for for many years"}
{"source": " They are simple to use and offer my banjos good humidification"}
{"source": "  I place a Herco in the neck section of the case and another in the section where the head sits"}
{"source": "For guitars I place a Herco near the peg head and a stringed instrument humidifier that slips between the strings in the other"}
{"source": " Great insurance against damage to instruments owing to dryness"}
{"source": "I like these humidifiers"}
{"source": "  Works if you keep it with instrument in your case, and upkeep is minimal"}
{"source": "  Work on all strings very well, but be careful, easy to fall out of case, so just be careful!"}
{"source": "It doesn't seem to work"}
{"source": " I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water"}
{"source": "Herco is a Jim Dunlop company and this little humidifier was suggested to me through someone who has used them for awhile"}
{"source": " Dunlop is a trusted brand in guitar maintenance for the most part"}
{"source": " I wanted to stay away from the typical humidifiers due to their tendencies to leak and stain the guitar wood"}
{"source": " I have used this for a few weeks now and it still remians moist"}
{"source": " The product came fast and the instructions are straight forward"}
{"source": " I may order another if this one performs well"}
{"source": "I used to use the Martin tube thing that you stick between the strings"}
{"source": "  But it was a bit of a pain"}
{"source": "  You had to soak it, then drain it, then wipe it"}
{"source": "  Even then, I worried about it dripping on the inside of the guitar"}
{"source": "  This is much easier and the guitar sounds great"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended"}
{"source": "Great slap echo sound"}
{"source": "  Do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay- it's closer to a reverb"}
{"source": "  It provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile (an old engineering trick!)"}
{"source": "  Great for old school rock and roll, rockabilly, chicken pickin etc"}
{"source": "  This will fatten up the sound of a dry amp"}
{"source": "  As with all FAB pedals, I find the knob placement slightly annoying, but at this price point you can't really make a justifiable complaint"}
{"source": "  Construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year"}
{"source": "These FAB pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre, but I bought this on a whim to use with a Fender tube amp and it works well"}
{"source": " As other reviewers have stated, the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it's not abused"}
{"source": " I use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects"}
{"source": "I have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay"}
{"source": " I don't know if I would gig with this pedal or any othe FAB pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments, but it serves it's purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect"}
{"source": " I have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future"}
{"source": "I have alot of other pedals and I tried this pedal with a jazz bass, with some EQ tinkering, I found a good mix of echo"}
{"source": " I originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a D-4 and thought it would be a good idea"}
{"source": " Again, Danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay, but this is a good deal and was $100 dollars cheaper than my Electro Harmonix Memory Boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp"}
{"source": "I've needed one of these for my fender amp, yes I used to spend time dialing in the delay pedal for the rockabilly/blues numbers and if my settings got messed up, well, that would slow the show down"}
{"source": " I wish my fender amp had this built into the amp but it didn't"}
{"source": " This pedal makes playing rockabilly on my fender simple fast and easy"}
{"source": " Really quick to setup and use"}
{"source": " It's not a delay unit, it's not versatile either, but what it does, it does perfect!"}
{"source": "this is perfect for playing rockabilly or country music"}
{"source": "the case is made of plastic but seems sturdy as long as you dont stomp on it too hard"}
{"source": " but for 20 dollars its well worth the price"}
{"source": "  this is a great product and i highly recomend it"}
{"source": "I admit, i was really just curious how good a $15 pedal could possibly be, so i figured i would try one out"}
{"source": " I had played some Danelectro stuff in the past (a baritone guitar and an amp many years ago) and remembered being satisfied with their stuff"}
{"source": " Anyway, i figured since the pedal was so cheap, why not try it out"}
{"source": "You know, it is a pretty decent stompbox"}
{"source": " The slap echo is a good enhancement effect, meaning, it isnt really over the top"}
{"source": "just gives you a mellow, reverb-ish echo"}
{"source": "not quite delay, not quite reverb"}
{"source": "kind of somewhere in between"}
{"source": " I have since added it to my stompbox set up for that little something different"}
{"source": " Not bad at all"}
{"source": " I cant speak to battery life though, since i use an adapter combo to power all my effects"}
{"source": " For kicks, try it out with some distortion and/or overdrive, and a wah"}
{"source": "Anyway"}
{"source": "Enjoy!"}
{"source": "I bought one of these pedals 3 years ago, along with some of the other Danelectro pedals in this line, and was happy with it"}
{"source": " The sound I get with it is very, very cool"}
{"source": " After a while it just stopped working"}
{"source": " While I was disappointed at that moment I just ordered another one the next time I was online"}
{"source": " You can't beat the price"}
{"source": " If it does stop working after after a few years of use, you aren't looking at paying $90 or more for a new pedal"}
{"source": " All of my other Danelectro pedals are still working just fine so it may have been a fluke in the electronics or I just used it to death"}
{"source": " An electrical engineer friend and I took the pedal apart to try and fix it but decided it wasn't worth taking up our time since I could replace for $15"}
{"source": " So I ordered another one"}
{"source": " Definately get an adapter for this"}
{"source": " Yes, it's casing is plastic but quite sturdy"}
{"source": " Just don't jump on it like you're trying to put out a fire when turning it on and off"}
{"source": " Guitars and effects are the tools of a musican's trade not the hammer and nails of a builder's"}
{"source": " Think about getting a 1 Spot adapter so you can chain several pedals to one outlet"}
{"source": " If you would rather use batteries for each of your pedals"}
{"source": "well"}
{"source": "I'd suggest buying them by the gross"}
{"source": " Any effects pedal made by any company is going to eat batteries like a stoner eats potato chips"}
{"source": " Used alone or with other effects, the Danelectro Fab Slap Echo Effects Pedal will be sure to delight your auditory kinesthesis"}
{"source": "the case is made of plastic so care should be taken in stomping on it but the product is so much fun!!! this thing is so worth the 20 dollars that i paid for it and more! wide sweeping flange effect, great harmonics and little power useage"}
{"source": "  well worth the investment!!!!"}
{"source": "I'm a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished"}
{"source": "  I want them to be slick when I bend notes"}
{"source": "  If you polish too hard or too often with steel wool, it can wear down your frets"}
{"source": "  These micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets"}
{"source": "  I watched a Youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them"}
{"source": "  I think Amazon had the best price"}
{"source": "I picked up this Behringer CT100 cable tester because it takes the guesswork out of maintaining a cable collection"}
{"source": " The unit does its job very well and it helped me find several bad cables that I previously thought were ok"}
{"source": " It is well built and sturdy"}
{"source": " The bottom of the tester has sharp metal corners and screws that could damage a wooden table"}
{"source": " I suggest you get some adhesive rubber pads to support the underside"}
{"source": "Although the machine itself is good, the accompanying documentation is awful"}
{"source": " It presupposes a working knowledge with audio equipment that many users may lack"}
{"source": " For example, it does not include illustrations of how the LCD readout should look when a cable is good or bad"}
{"source": " I had to go to an audio engineering forum to find a diagram"}
{"source": " As it turns out, the Behringer CT100 is an inexpensive knockoff of the Morley Swizz Army cable tester"}
{"source": " The manual for the Morley unit is available online and it has diagrams that make the testing easier to understand"}
{"source": "Got this little guy last night to use with my Squier Tele Custom II, hooked it up and played around with it for a while and it really impressed me for the quality of effect you get for nearly pocket change! I also have a Digitech RP-50 that has multiple effects including different types of chorus and this Fab Chorus sounds better than any of the RP-50's chorus settings"}
{"source": "  I am so looking forward to laying down some cool tracks using this with the Tele, my Applause acoustic/electric, and my Squier Vintage Modified 70's bass guitar"}
{"source": " And like other folks who've bought this product, I'll most likely be getting some of Danelectro's other Fab boxes and the Dan Electrode power supply"}
{"source": "its sound pretty good "}
{"source": " i mean , the range /rate arent as broad as others i've tried "}
{"source": "but i stomp on it regularly"}
{"source": " it cuts my signal a bit "}
{"source": " so i compensate ,,an always leave a bit of extra volume in the bank to make it up"}
{"source": "all in all=worth it"}
{"source": "I got the $50 standard black on black case"}
{"source": "  The case arrived within 2 days via UPS during the middle of the Christmas rush! Wow! Very fast shipping and it was adequately packaged and there was no sign of the box being abused in anyway"}
{"source": " Regarding the item itself, I am bit lukewarm"}
{"source": " I have a $500 Washburn and wanted something more than a gig bag for going to and from gigs and practice sessions"}
{"source": " And I got that"}
{"source": " Its lightweight, plenty of room in the gear box and on top of the guitar head"}
{"source": "  However, the fit is a bit loose and I don't have the sense that this case will stand up to much abuse over time"}
{"source": "  So if you have a pricey guitar or are planning to load you guitar in a truck with other gear, or might ship your guitar or take it on a plane, this case is not the one you want to buy"}
{"source": "Guardian?  Well, it is padded, but I've only gigged once since having the item (with 3 rehearsals held prior) and I can say that the case is nicked up \"pretty good,\" as they say in the South"}
{"source": "  Yes, it will last, because it is a guitar case, but there's no way there's enough security to protect an instrument on a plane"}
{"source": "  Now, that's for flight cases to handle, but don't even come near abusing your instrument while it is housed inside this case, because you may be disappointed to have to buy new parts once the \"guardian\" fails to guard against crushing your hardware"}
{"source": "  This item is not one of the better cases out there, but it does suffice, and it does look good"}
{"source": "  The first day I got it, someone said, \"nice case, it looks great!\"  Say that now, though, after using it outside the house 4 times, and you'd be a lying SOB"}
{"source": "This is a typical inexpensive hardshell guitar case made in China"}
{"source": "  I bought it to replace the original (chipboard) case for a 1963 Gibson ES-135 archtop"}
{"source": "  Lower bout is 16&#34; wide, upper bout is 12&#34; wide, body is 21 &#34; long, and it's about 5&#34; deep at the bridge"}
{"source": "  Fits very snugly in this case which is what I was hoping for"}
{"source": "  The case is about 4&#34; longer than the top of the headstock but I didn't expect an exact fit"}
{"source": "  The wood shell is thin so don't drop anything on it but it is also lighter than a lot of other cases"}
{"source": "  Normal plush fake fur inside with about 3/4 of soft foam all around"}
{"source": "  Black tolex on the outside is thin but looks okay"}
{"source": "  This is NOT a case to take on the road or if you travel by air but it is adequate for casual use"}
{"source": "  Only annoying thing: the case arrived locked"}
{"source": "  The keys were, of course, inside the case"}
{"source": "  Dumb"}
{"source": "  A friend at a music store used a key from another Guardian case to unlock it"}
{"source": "  A good reminder that the case latch lock is to keep the latch from popping open and NOT to keep crooks out"}
{"source": "Just what I needed to position my guitar while seated"}
{"source": "  I was worried it would not hold the weight, but it does well"}
{"source": "The other reviews for this foot rest called it sturdy and well built"}
{"source": " They were right"}
{"source": " It can be adjusted to a number of different heights to suit your particular needs - and based on the design of the stand it will stay where it's put"}
{"source": " One of the best parts is that while it is stable enough to be the main foot rest where I play my guitar it can be collapsed flat and it easily fits into a bag or backpack - probably around half of the thickness of a chord book, although heavier, as it is steel with a rubber tread on top"}
{"source": " It feels like I will own this for a long time - a well priced, good value"}
{"source": "Edit2/2013After owning this for around a year and using it every day I find that it still looks and works like new"}
{"source": " I recommend it highly"}
{"source": "I've owned several poor quality foot rests in the past and needed a new one"}
{"source": "  This one exceeded my expectations and for the price is an excellent value"}
{"source": "I'm 6'2 and weigh 225"}
{"source": "  There are numerous adjustment angles that I can switch to and be comfortable and I'm not concerned about the legs bending"}
{"source": "  The photo makes them look weaker than they are"}
{"source": "I've uploaded customer-supplied images above to show just how much gear one of these is capable of holding and how small the stage or studio footprint is"}
{"source": " When you factor in the price it's plain to see that this rack is not only a bargain, but a flexible platform for mounting components"}
{"source": "One other characteristic that the images reveals is this is not a table-top only rack"}
{"source": " They work very well on the floor"}
{"source": "The rack itself is easy to assemble and is built like a tank"}
{"source": " I have a bass amp head and a power amp, plus a power conditioner in one of my racks that, combined, weighs around 50 pounds"}
{"source": " The rack is not stressed or strained by this weight, and could probably hold another 50 pounds safely and reliably"}
{"source": " Another plus is it comes with a bag of high quality mounting screws for components, eliminating that expense (I was expecting to have to orderRaxxess Rack Screws With Washers Hardware (Pack of 25), which turned out to be completely unnecessary"}
{"source": ")My only complaint is the rubber feet caps easily fall off, but a little glue rectified that rather trivial problem"}
{"source": "If you need portability, reliability and value for smaller gear suites that are frequently moved (such as setting up on stages) this is an ideal solution for rack mounted equipment"}
{"source": " I am so pleased with mine that I intend to purchase another one, bringing the total to three"}
{"source": "The ability to quickly change the range and sensitivity has made it easy to dial in the exact sound you want to hear"}
{"source": " It's built like a tank and has worked flawlessly in the time I've had it"}
{"source": " Since I normally power it with a wall wart, I don't have much of an opinion about battery life"}
{"source": "Bottom Line: It costs a bit more than the standard Dunlop wah pedals, it's worth it"}
{"source": "Sure it's a few bucks more than the standard Crybaby, but totally worth it"}
{"source": " Built like a tank, but make sure to apply a little bit of white lithium grease to the gear pieces once a year or so to keep things smooth and reduce wear on the inner workings"}
{"source": "for 99 dollars , quit looking at other wah pedals"}
{"source": "this one does it all"}
{"source": "its so versatile"}
{"source": "sounds very authenic 60's too,"}
{"source": "good pedal movement"}
{"source": "endless variations in sound avaialable"}
{"source": "it gets a great sound right out of the box "}
{"source": "dig it man,,!!"}
{"source": "Your option to change the wah configuration is amazing"}
{"source": " Only problem is the no DC adapter included, needs buy separately"}
{"source": "For years I played the original Cry baby, the Vox Wah, and others I can't remember names of"}
{"source": " I was always on a quest for a good wah sound that I just couldn't find"}
{"source": " I didn't want to spend $600 on a wah with a rack"}
{"source": " So at the recomendation of a studio engineer I purchased this wah about 5 years ago"}
{"source": " I am very pleased that I followed that advice because this pedal really has the range of wah I was looking for"}
{"source": " The greatest thing about this pedal is that it is customizable"}
{"source": " The user dials in the frequency sweep they want"}
{"source": " The volume boost is a great feature when you need to play a lead over the live mix"}
{"source": " I recomend this wah pedal over all the others, especially the signature series wahs because you can get the same sound out of this unit with a little tweeking"}
{"source": "This is the wah I was looking for"}
{"source": "  Very versatile and built in boost feature is great too"}
{"source": " buy it"}
{"source": "you wont regret it"}
{"source": "First of all, I love the Crybaby 535Q and I recommend this wah pedal"}
{"source": " I will tell you my wah pedal story"}
{"source": "Several years ago, I bought a Crybaby GCB-95 and, even though I did not use wah very much at the time, I think it was in the shop twice to get repaired within a year"}
{"source": " Fortunately, it never gave out on me during a gig, but it was only a matter of time"}
{"source": " Finally, I gave up and just stopped using wah pedals completely"}
{"source": "A couple years ago, I bought a Digitech XP-100 whammy wah, mainly for the whammy effects to learn how to do Morello's style"}
{"source": " Since it has some digital wah patches was available, I started to use them too and was happy because it doesn't have a treadle that will break like on my GCB-95"}
{"source": " The wahs were usable, but just did not sound as good"}
{"source": "Finally I was supposed to play Alice in Chains, \"Man in the Box\" and the Digitech was just not going to cut it"}
{"source": " So, it was time to get a real wah"}
{"source": " I searched around on YouTube for demos and talked to people to see what they used"}
{"source": " I chose the 535Q because people told me that they've never had a maintenance problem with them, and it is very versatile"}
{"source": "You can get several kinds of wah sounds by tweaking the dials,and they have some great suggestions in the manual to get started"}
{"source": " I set mine on the Cantrell setting and have left it there because I mainly use the wah when playing early alternative 90s hard rock styles"}
{"source": " That setting works will in songs like RATM, \"Bulls on Parade\" as well, including to create the white noise for scratch DJ sounds"}
{"source": "I still do not use wah pedals terribly often, but it is nice to have a reliable wah that can do whatever I need it to by simply adjusting a couple knobs"}
{"source": " I think that as long as I need a wah pedal, this one will suit my needs in many styles, and I think it will remain on my pedalboard for years! It is definitely one to consider, and the price is not that bad"}
{"source": "This is better than a gig bag, for sure, and looks like it could hold pretty much any standard sized solid body electric"}
{"source": " Now, it's not padded really well and doesn't look like it'll hold up for more than a few years, but it was cheap"}
{"source": " It seems to be slightly off kilter at the hinges and requires some fidgeting to get the lid closed properly, which is why I drop a star"}
{"source": "This is an inexpensive but for the money, well built case"}
{"source": " I don't have any complaints"}
{"source": " My Fender Strat fits snugly in the lined case and while it isn't the most durable case (I wouldn't use it to ship my guitar) it is strong enough for hauling your guitar from one place to the next"}
{"source": "The Pyle \"Battery Powered PA System With Wireless Microphone\" is surprisingly well made and has features I would have expected on much more expensive equipment"}
{"source": " We run workshops, often at our customer's locations, and needed a portable PA system that could easily be transported and doesn't require a lot of power"}
{"source": " Here are my observations:+ Long Battery Life - Worked for over 4 hours straight, but can be connected to AC to work as well+ Wireless Microphone - Built into the system, has good range, and acceptable sound"}
{"source": " Battery included"}
{"source": "+ Inputs for 2 Microphones, 1 Guitar, and 1 Audio Connection - Each with it's own volume control+ Portable - Built in retractable handles and wheels makes moving this around very easy+ Includes a mini-Plug to 1/4\" Converter - A handy accessory+ Includes Echo Effect - A fun adjustable effect to liven up your voice (my kids loved playing with this :-)Note: My unit shipped with one of the fuses in a bag and it needed to be installed before the system would work"}
{"source": "This unit worked much better than expected and is a great value for the performance of this small sized unit!Highly Recommended!"}
{"source": "It works and is very versatile and puts out great sound and power"}
{"source": "  the portable feature is great also"}
{"source": " Just what i wanted"}
{"source": "This system works just okay"}
{"source": "  Try to turn it up and you get bad feedback"}
{"source": "My microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item"}
{"source": "  I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them"}
{"source": "They couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one, or where I could even buy a replacement"}
{"source": "Very frustrating!"}
{"source": "This is a wonderful product for the price! Ive used other tube preamps that cause terrible humming at low input gain"}
{"source": " A little difficult to set up properly, but if you are running an eq separate, then you only have to adjust the input and output"}
{"source": " I dont care much for the tube display with led lights behind it, but it doesn't bother me either"}
{"source": " Behringer makes great products at incomparable prices"}
{"source": "I use this as a microphone preamp with an AKG Perception 220 microphone"}
{"source": " There are 2 ins and 2 outs, 1 balanced/1 unbalanced on each channel"}
{"source": " I am not an expert on studio equipment so this review is from a personal position"}
{"source": " I run this direct to my digital recorder"}
{"source": " I get a good clean sound on my vocals"}
{"source": " Still to early to give reliabilty and flexability of this unit"}
{"source": " The unit is 2 channels, has rack mounts and is sturdy, not sure on the tube yet"}
{"source": " New to the Behringer product line, but so far I like it and will explore its potential"}
{"source": " 5 stars for price, quality, features, amazon"}
{"source": "I like this preamp"}
{"source": " I use one channel for microphone and the other for an electric guitar with good results"}
{"source": "Is very sadly and spendthrift that its useful life will be the duration of its tube, another concept of producci&oacute;n nothing considered with consumer and planet"}
{"source": "I operate an alternative broadcast studio, we create music related content and broadcast it on the internet"}
{"source": " We needed some stand-alone microphone preamps and after searching the internet I decided to give this Behringer unit a try"}
{"source": "This single rack space unit provides two independent microphone preamps, each of which is equipped with a single band of sweepable parametric equalization to adjust the timbre of the final output"}
{"source": " Before I even tried the piece as a preamp I opened it up to look inside"}
{"source": "DO NOT EXPECT TO CHANGE THE TUBEThe tube is mounted in such a way that it is probably impossible to change it out for a different one"}
{"source": "Fortunately the preamps sound good with the stock tube"}
{"source": " There is no schematic provided so it's really impossible to say how the tube is implemented in the circuit and how much it actually contributes to the tone of the unit"}
{"source": "HOW DOES IT SOUNDThe preamps sound very good, full, rich, crisp highs, deep lows, it's a function of the microphone you connect to it as far as I can tell"}
{"source": " For comparison I A-B compared this preamp to our very expensive API 3124+ preamp which is a 4-channel unit that we paid over $500 per preamp-channel for, that is 10-times the price per channel of this Behringer unit"}
{"source": " I'm not going to say the Behringer beat the API but they were a dead heat in most listening tests"}
{"source": " My female partner who is not too technical (but has great ears) thought the Behringer was just as good as the API"}
{"source": " We also have a Grace m801 which is another over-$500/channel preamp, she definitely liked the Behringer sound better than the Grace (personally I think it was the EQ on the Behringer that affected her choice when comparing to the Grace)"}
{"source": "If my API or Grace preamps go toast I will definitely have them repaired"}
{"source": " If the Behringer dies, it's going in the trash and I'll buy another one"}
{"source": " It's simple economics and at $100 for two preamps that sound as good as they do these are really nice"}
{"source": " They sound good"}
{"source": " They have an industry standard packaging"}
{"source": " The input and output connectors are excellent"}
{"source": " It even has a line input mode so you can add a little tube distortion to a line-level signal (I have not tried this because we don't need it)"}
{"source": "We broadcast between three and ten, live one-hour shows per week using this preamp for vocals"}
{"source": " NOBODY in our listening audience has ever complained and none of them know we switched from our high-end pieces to this very inexpensive preamp"}
{"source": " Now our expensive preamps are back over in our production studio and are used for recording tracks that play behind our live performances during the shows"}
{"source": "RELIABILITYWe have not had any problems with this unit"}
{"source": " It is warmed up for an hour before each broadcast, I've never heard any noise or bad stuff come from it"}
{"source": " We have A LOT of Behringer gear in our studio, it lives right along side gear from Neve, API, Allen and Heath, UA, Meyer, Lexicon and Apogee"}
{"source": " Out of 103 pieces of Behringer equipment I've bought we've had two pieces that had problems and those occurred right out to the box"}
{"source": " I had much worse reliability with Crown amplifiers than Behringer products and I really like Crown amps, regardless of the problems, they just sound so good"}
{"source": " In my experience the Behringer products have provided professional results for an amazing low price"}
{"source": " That's a win-win in my book"}
{"source": "Seems to work well"}
{"source": "  Like the other reviewers said, you could probably pay 150 more and get the same thing"}
{"source": "  solid construction"}
{"source": "  getting used to the attachment"}
{"source": "  It will never stand in the position like in the photo"}
{"source": "  There's no resistance on that joint so it flops down"}
{"source": "  Just place it upside down"}
{"source": "  Record using a headset or you'll get too much feedback"}
{"source": "  Just ordered a shorter stand"}
{"source": "  Hope that it works with that joint that makes it stand head down"}
{"source": "I'm just getting into miking and recording music, mainly to get my son off to a good start"}
{"source": " I'm kind of feeling my way"}
{"source": " When I wasn't getting a good result from a dynamic mic, a friend suggested a pre-amp and/or a condenser mike"}
{"source": " I ended up getting both (the AMP tube pre-amp) and running this through the AMP into my Tascam DP-008"}
{"source": " WOW! I have to work on getting the levels matched properly, but this thing is just SO much cleaner than the dynamic mics when used on an acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " Our music sessions have slowed down a bit (he just turned 16, so hanging with the Old Man is the LAST thing on his mind, LOL), but this is a quality piece of equipment that seems durable"}
{"source": " Includes a nice hard plastic carry-case, too"}
{"source": " For this kind of money, you can't really go wrong"}
{"source": "For the money, this mic performs very well"}
{"source": " It is very sensitive, I can hear my computer fans in the background with this mic"}
{"source": " If you are going to use it for recording make sure you have a quiet room"}
{"source": " I also put a pop filter on it"}
{"source": " I've only had it a day, so I'll see how it does in the long run"}
{"source": "[Later: The mic is indeed the Behringer C-1, but Amazon has provided it with the description belonging to the C-1U"}
{"source": "  Unlike Amazon's description, this is not a mic that comes with USB plug, phantom power, and computer connectivity"}
{"source": " And, of course, none of the advertised \"included\" computer software programs is included"}
{"source": "  It's a conventional studio mic that requires connection to a regular amp / P"}
{"source": "A"}
{"source": " with an XLR jack and phantom power"}
{"source": " It will NOT connect to the USB port of a computer without an expensive adapter and a preamp with phantom power"}
{"source": "  Moreover, Amazon's form thus far is denying a refund and offering only replacement--presumably for another mic just like this one! If you want the described mic, Amazon is showing it from a different vendor--at about 30 more plus S&H"}
{"source": ";]The Behringer C-1 mic is the best condenser mic I've used for the money, its large diaphragm capable of reproducing some of the rich and deep sonorities of the costly, high-end mics at the radio station (NPR) where I occasionally work"}
{"source": "  However, Behringer makes a distinction between the C-1 and the C-1U"}
{"source": "  The description on Amazon fits the C-1U, not the C-1"}
{"source": "  So one way or another, 50% of the purchasers of this product are likely to be surprised and disappointed"}
{"source": "Indeed, the C-1U is a phantom-powered mic that doesn't require phantom power, which it derives from the USB port of a computer"}
{"source": "  Moreover, the mic not only saves its owner the bother of a pre-amp with phantom power but it also makes unnecessary a costly (and time-consuming) XLR to USB adapter"}
{"source": "  It's ready to go--just plug it into your laptop and start recording"}
{"source": "  (I use Sound Studio, but the included free software--Audacity--works practically as well"}
{"source": ")On the other hand, if the mic is a C-1 as advertised, be prepared to receive a conventional condenser mic, with an XLR connector and a phantom power requirement (found on numerous recording devices and P"}

{"source": "T"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "Having just returned a keyboard--the M-Audio Pro88sx--for which Amazon mistakenly provided the wrong description (for the M-Audio Pro88, not the Pro88sx), I'd be hesitant to place any bets on which mic the buyer will receive--the C-1 as advertised, or the C-1U as described"}
{"source": "  At least if you're purchasing directly from Amazon instead of a sub-vendor, you can be assured of a hassle-free return"}
{"source": "  And if the mistake is due to Amazon's description, returns are generally postage-free"}
{"source": "I can't believe I'm giving a 5 star review to a Behringer product, but they got these right"}
{"source": " I replaced a way-more expensive Audix condenser mic with these, and they actually sound pretty darned good"}
{"source": " If I crunch one or if one breaks, I'll just get more at this price"}
{"source": " I have other Behringer mics laying around, and they all kinda suck"}
{"source": " These are totally fine"}
{"source": "These come with a stereo holding bar and adapter for mic stand"}
{"source": "  They do need 48 V phanom power from your board or a mic amp"}
{"source": "  I'm using a mic amp and these are the input to a paging system which I will review in more detail later"}
{"source": "  The 48VDC comes from the mic processor then cancels feedback and sends the paging audio to my amplifier which I will review as a set"}
{"source": "If you do stereo recording, you can't go wrong with these - their self noise level is so low it is below that of a human ear"}
{"source": "  It sounds great, and setup outside with 140 dB of gain it really performs well hearing birds chirp from far away, rain drops comming down, and sounds you never would hear"}
{"source": "Note:  NEVER get these wet - you must have a cover over them for outdoor use in the rain"}
{"source": "You will need 2 XLR cables for full stereo recording with the transfer bar, but you already know that"}
{"source": "I use this pair of mics mostly to record a piano in XY configurationPros:-Price point-Sturdy, good construction-Included accessories (carrying case, clips, stereo bar)Cons:-Have to adjust the gain just right on a mixer preamp to avoid noise"}
{"source": "These are condenser mics so you will need phantom power to make them work"}
{"source": " I'm using them in our drum room, one is on hi-hat and one is on a small cymbal"}
{"source": " They have a smooth un-hyped sound"}
{"source": "The mics also come with a nice little plastic mounting bar so you can mount them in a stereo pair right out of the box"}
{"source": " I have used them in an X-Y overhead position and they sounded quite good and very natural"}
{"source": "Some of the other microphones in my kit cost upwards of $1200 each so I am aware of what &#34;expensive&#34; microphones sound like, these perform &#34;up there&#34; with the expensive mice while being bargain priced"}
{"source": "Good music to all"}
{"source": "2 15&#34; speakers each with a horn built into the cabinet"}
{"source": " These hold up great year round"}
{"source": " I will more than likely take the speakers down to make sure they don't fall onto my baby grand"}

{"source": "I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, I have had enough"}
{"source": "The main problem with this tuner is the usability"}
{"source": "The tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key"}
{"source": "Tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating"}
{"source": "The needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune"}
{"source": "The poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too"}
{"source": " Combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner"}
{"source": "Yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents"}
{"source": "Enough said, I bought a new tuner, the Seiko SAT800, for a bit more money that this"}
{"source": "The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not"}
{"source": "CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not"}
{"source": "SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto"}
{"source": "SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": " 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves"}
{"source": "SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not"}
{"source": "The needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall"}
{"source": "I wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner"}
{"source": " I was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on Amazon and I hope you would not be"}
{"source": "This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work"}
{"source": " As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there"}
{"source": " Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end"}
{"source": " At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine"}
{"source": " So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input"}
{"source": "I have tried several different brands/types of tuners in my 13 years of playing"}
{"source": " I have found that this model fits my needs perfectly"}
{"source": " It quickly detects the tune, dynamically changes as you turn the tuning pegs, and is extremely accurate"}
{"source": " It also has options to tune flat, sharp, guitar, bass, etc"}
{"source": "It is also small and portable"}
{"source": " I have one in EACH of my 12 guitar cases and it fits into the accessory pockets/pouches perfectly"}
{"source": " I cant recommend this tuner enough"}
{"source": "As always, please indicate if this review was helpful and keep on rockin'"}
{"source": "The quality and feel of this tuner is very good"}
{"source": " Tuning the guitar is really easy, just put the batteries in (it comes with 2 AAA batteries) and press the red button to turn it on, then pluck the strings! This is my first tuner and its great already! It's very portable"}
{"source": "There are better tuners out there"}
{"source": " Far better"}
{"source": " This could be good, but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to Standard (especially when tuning the G string)! I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic"}
{"source": " This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using \"F\" or \"C\" notes"}
{"source": " I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings"}
{"source": " Trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere"}
{"source": "These are the only picks I use"}
{"source": "  They're Fender thins and the quality is one thing that Fender has kept consistent"}
{"source": "  They arrived on time and I will order them again"}
{"source": "After experiencing some frustration with the tone differences and the difference in the amount of noise between a Stevens steel bar (for lap playing) and a Dunlop 210 glass over-the-finger slide (for \"Spanish style\" playing), I decided to try the Dunlop Harris tapered brass slide"}
{"source": "  It's probably a personal issue, but I much prefer the weight of the brass slide"}
{"source": "  The taper seems to cover the stings of my resonator guitar more consistently than the straight glass slide"}
{"source": "  The sustain is better and the string noise is easier to control"}
{"source": "  This slide also seems to be well made and has a nice shine to it"}
{"source": "  The material and the fact that it fits better than the glass slide are significant pluses"}
{"source": "  Another practical plus for the brass slide is that I don't have to worry about what would happen if I drop it"}
{"source": "  In short:  it's a winner"}
{"source": "I never use slide to play my guitar, this is the first I ever have, look like good quality, I just have to learn how to play ;-)"}
{"source": "When they say small, they mean small"}
{"source": "  I had to order the large to get it comfortably on my ring finger, and my hands are not large by anyone's standards"}
{"source": "Find the same slide in Large, and I wrote a complimentary review there"}
{"source": "Sounds and feels nice"}
{"source": " I have an entry level guitar, a Peavey Rockmaster"}
{"source": " It came with entry level strings"}
{"source": " These strings make it sound like an upgraded instrument"}
{"source": "Be advised, the low E string is thick"}
{"source": " When I try to depress the 12th fret, I can't get it to register as a hit with Rocksmith 2014 unless I press HARD with my middle or index finger"}
{"source": " Well, sometimes the pinky is needed to do that"}
{"source": " Plan on a weaker score if you learn guitar using this game"}
{"source": "I have used the EXL115W set for years"}
{"source": "  Nice to have the whole set again"}
{"source": "  Sometimes have to buy the EXL115 without the wound third, and then have to find the wound third in a single string"}
{"source": "  Not fun"}
{"source": "  I like the sound of the wound third"}
{"source": "  I play a thin hollow-body electric and love how the strings sound and are easy on the fingers"}
{"source": "  No more thick calouses on the fingers"}
{"source": "  Playing weekinds and practicing, they last a long time with the same sound quality"}
{"source": "I got these about five months ago and they still have not broken on me"}
{"source": " That is a record"}
{"source": " The tones are warm and welcoming, not as sharp as with other strings"}
{"source": " It is the sound that I like though"}
{"source": "I purchased this wax for a brand new guitar to help minimize scratches on the back though I make every effort to avoid them, and to protect the side where I rest my arm when playing to keep from wearing through the finish over time"}
{"source": "I've used Carnuba car wax many years ago, and this is a much higher grade, easier to apply, easy to remove"}
{"source": "There were some really tiny cracks in the polyurethane finish that I did not notice at first and I was actually able to fill them using a couple of coats of this product so they now look like tiny indentations with a smooth surface"}
{"source": " They were very minor and did not affect the wood, but this will seal them"}
{"source": " Not a sufficient defect to return the instrument"}
{"source": "Another reviewer mentioned a problem applying to metal"}
{"source": " I have open tuning machines, and before applying Tri-Flow with a pinpoint applicator, I used this wax, let it dry then buffed it out with a pure cotton towel"}
{"source": " The chrome is gleaming"}
{"source": " They're really beautiful"}
{"source": " Did a great job on the headstock as well with MOP and abalone inlay when the strings were removed"}
{"source": " Also got the tuning pegs"}
{"source": " This is a 000 - OM acoustic"}
{"source": " Only way I can imagine harming metal is you slightly dampen the sponge, (I used distilled water) so if someone left too much water - possibly a problem, but all worked fine for me"}
{"source": "I bought this wax and compared it to Meguiars I've been using for years and it surpasses Meguiars by miles"}
{"source": " I have a few guitars and they really shine with this wax, you can really see the depth of the paint with this wax and it works great on headstocks also"}
{"source": " I like the applicator and the fact that this is a paste wax which is effortless to apply"}
{"source": "Along with a few high end guitars, I also have a few beaters"}
{"source": " I used this wax on an old Squier that is thoroughly used and it looks fantastic"}
{"source": " fine scratches and blems are gone and the guitar looks great"}
{"source": "I use old t shirts to buff the wax off the guitars and found that it comes off chrome easilly, I overdid it with an older Les Paul guitar and was surprised to see the wax come off with ease"}
{"source": " I will buy this stuff again and again, my local guitar shop sells this for the same price"}
{"source": "I really feel like this thing is my personal slave, just standing off to the side, waiting to grab my guitar when I hand it off"}
{"source": " It is reliable and rock solid"}
{"source": " The tripod base has been very steady so far"}
{"source": " It really is a great product"}
{"source": "The other thing I have to say about this stand is that it has the non-scuff padding on the all the RIGHT places"}
{"source": " I bought another stand from another company that claimed to have similar material"}
{"source": " And it did, but not at all the guitar contact points"}
{"source": "I do have to laugh at the folks here and on Musician's Friend who have given this a bad rating because of the following:1"}
{"source": " \"It ejected my guitar when it got tilted forward"}
{"source": "\" - The basic idea is their guitar was on-stage, someone pushed the stand forward, the patented guitar retaining mechanism disengaged when the base of the guitar touch the floor on the way to the ground, releasing the guitar and dumping on the floor"}
{"source": " REALITY: Let's say the stand held onto the guitar"}
{"source": " It still would have hit face first and messed up the guitar"}
{"source": " Sometimes accidents happen"}
{"source": " Don't blame the stand"}
{"source": " Blame the moron who knocked over your guitar"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " \"The guitar touches the floor"}
{"source": "\" - It's not supposed to! Try elevating the next, or make sure you bought the model appropriate for your kind of guitar"}
{"source": "This stand is worth the extra money over those $15 disasters"}
{"source": " Spend an extra $10 and save yourself the headache"}
{"source": "I've been playing the guitar since the 1960's, so I've gone through plenty of guitar stands"}
{"source": "  Always found the hanging-type to be the safest & most secure"}
{"source": "  For a long time I was using the Hamilton chrome hanging stand"}
{"source": "  When I first saw these being used by all the guitar players at the church I attend (Christ Community Church, St Charles, IL), I decided to give them a look"}
{"source": "  The build quality is very good and all the sections that come in contact with the guitar (Electric or Acoustic) are padded with a foam material to prevent scratching/ denting"}
{"source": "  It offers a very solid support and I feel safe putting my guitar on it"}
{"source": "  This is the only type of stand I prefer to use"}
{"source": "  I do wish it wasn't made in China, too much of our money goes to that country (just my opinion)"}
{"source": "  The bottom line is that I am very happy with this stand and would recommend it to any guitar player who wants a sturdy, well built stand that keeps the guitar safe and should last for ever"}
{"source": "I bought this stand primarily to hold my Epiphone Les Paul"}
{"source": " I have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the Hercules"}
{"source": " The stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs"}
{"source": " There is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands"}
{"source": " I can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues"}
{"source": " I plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " I like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place"}
{"source": "I strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there, the extra cost is well worth the investment"}
{"source": " I bought this at my local guitar shop for $40 after looking into it, the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while I was there"}
{"source": "UPDATE 11/5/12- A few weeks ago, I bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers"}
{"source": " I usually buy locally, but the deal here was great"}
{"source": " The stand is worth the price and more"}
{"source": "I bought a cheap Rogue A100 mandolin, and after setting it up I of course replaced the cheap factory strings"}
{"source": "  I put these on, and what a difference"}
{"source": "  These aren't too heavy, not too light"}
{"source": "  They ring nicely"}
{"source": "  I find that coating bronze strings with a good string cleaner, like Dunlop 65 Ultraglide, can help you avoid the dirty fingers and get much more life from the strings"}
{"source": "The J74's are sort of the default string that mandolin dealers put on their instruments"}
{"source": "  They are bright and brassy when new, and give a decent punch to the sound"}
{"source": "  However because they are bronze, they can discolor your fingers and they tarnish pretty quickly, especially in the summer when your fingers are sweatier"}
{"source": "  Also, since they are round-wound, they are harder to fret than a flat-wound string and harder to shift up and down"}
{"source": "  But the people who like them change them often, like once in 30 days or so, or whenever they play a gig, to get that nice bright brassy punch for when they are new"}
{"source": "  This is because they get to a point where you have to work harder just to get the same volume, being less elastic, and less lively"}
{"source": "  One thing is sure, that the J74's are loud and zingy, and that's why dealers put them on their mandolins"}
{"source": "  Some folks move to the heavier J75's to get even louder and fatter woof on their chops"}
{"source": "  The J74's are brighter and more aggressive than flatwound strings and cut through when you're in ensemble work"}
{"source": "  Just make sure to change them often to get the best performance"}
{"source": "D'Addario strings have become the favorite for all my guitars, and now my two mandolins"}
{"source": " Consistent quality and good tone and volume have made me loyal to the brand"}
{"source": "What more can I say? These strings sound GREAT! They play wonderfully, work well together, have a nice brilliant (but not tinny) sound, and are excellently made"}
{"source": " These are not going to unwind on you or break easily"}
{"source": "Excellent"}
{"source": " That's all there is to say about it"}
{"source": "I've never bought strings before so it is kind of hard for me to rate these"}
{"source": "  So far so good!"}
{"source": "This is the stand you remember from the band room"}
{"source": " Effective, and built like a tank"}
{"source": " You will need a wrench to assemble (a very simple task)"}
{"source": " One note - the metal feet would scratch some types of flooring, invest in the optional foot covers if you're concerned"}
{"source": "this stand is VERY GOOD ! nice and strong , i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this , it is worth a lot more then 29 dollars, this will last a life time, and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily,,i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash,, so i looked for something better and ,i am so happy to have found this , at this price"}
{"source": "i didn't want to pay more then 15 dollars for a stand ,but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for 9 or 15 dollars and in 6 months its in the trash ,i would be buying another one , so really ,this is the BEST DEAL , i am SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS STAND you can't go wrong with this one,,,REALY !! get it !  it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over,its heavy enough not to, it slides up and down nicely, and the book shelf  tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well, "}
{"source": ",bolts are NOT plastic,witch is nice,,and very easy to put together and fast,,i got it together in one minute,i only used regular pliers to put it together"}
{"source": "  the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument,i truly recommend this for anyone  ! (i did get the foot guards for $1"}
{"source": "95 to protect floor, on carpet you will not need them ,)and it comes with a 10 year warranty ,and with the free shipping you can't beet it,"}
{"source": "Good cheap basic metal slide, sounds like it should"}
{"source": " Only problem is I prefer to wear it on my ring finger but I have big hands (viz XL and XXL gloves) and the slide is too small to fit except on my little finger"}
{"source": " A bit annoying but not the slide's fault I guess!"}
{"source": "Sweet \"twangy\" sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars"}
{"source": "  I have a ceramic and this steel slide"}
{"source": "  Each has a unique sound"}
{"source": "  The steel as expected has more of brighter twang"}
{"source": "  When I change my strings, I know that I'll get some differences in tonal quality, but hey, experimenting for that sound that reaches us is what keeps all of us buying new toys"}
{"source": "I did purchase 3 diferent slides this one is mark as a medium but is diferent size from the other one's what I ordered"}
{"source": " Perhaps is good for some one with small wrong size "}
{"source": " This is why I give only 3 stars because is to small for me"}
{"source": "Great sounding slider for my electric AND it won't shatter when you drop it on the floor like the more expensive glass ones do"}
{"source": " Plus the medium weight of it is perfect for my smaller hands to control the slide action"}
{"source": " It has a great sound for the modern electric guitars, but is not really meant for lighter acoustic performances"}
{"source": " I recommend"}
{"source": "Black Tortex picks with silver lettering"}
{"source": "The Jazz picks are about 25% smaller than standard Tortex picks and have a more pronounced point"}
{"source": "I just got these in and I have to say, very disappointed"}
{"source": "  It's as if I went into a boy's shop and bought a large shirt and expected it to fit a man"}
{"source": "  What do they call medium or small?  This \"large pick\"  barely goes over my thumbnail area"}
{"source": " I can hold it, sort of, so we'll see how well it works with my hybrid plectrum project"}
{"source": "  (BTW, I'm an average grown man, 5'7\", 165)  More to come"}
{"source": "Here we go, a few months later:  I just had a chat with a music store guy and found out that a \"large\" thumb pick refers to the thickness of the pick!  Bottom line, if you want a thumb pick that fits, go to a store and try before you buy!  Good luck to all"}
{"source": "Iv'e tried a lot of thumb picks( i use them for bass) you no what that doe's to them,these are the one's i'm staying with these thumb's"}
{"source": "I've been using National medium thumb picks for the last year until my last one broke"}
{"source": "  Decided to try the Dunlop"}
{"source": "  Overall - I'm very pleased with this pick"}
{"source": "Previous reviews have indicated that these picks are smaller than the National mediums"}
{"source": "  This is true, but isn't a complete description"}
{"source": "  Basically, the National picks are much more elongated - so while the nail to thumb-pad distance is about the same on both, the across nail distance is much greater on the National picks"}
{"source": "  I actually find the Dunlop pick to fit much better, and I don't get extra overhang as with the National (which tends to catch the string)"}
{"source": "I wear a large sized glove, so assuming that would translate, I got these"}
{"source": "  While I can force it over my thumb, it is very tight and uncomfortable (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", pinches)"}
{"source": "  My thumbs don't have a particularly excessive diameter either"}
{"source": "  I'm gonna try to heat these so I can stretch them a bit"}
{"source": "  I know they need to be snug so the pick doesn't rotate when being used, but this is ridiculous"}
{"source": "  Three stars because if they fit you, it is a nice pick (it would be 5 if they were described correctly for sizing)"}
{"source": "These items, though well made, and strong, are sized rather differently to National picks - With the National, I need a Large, so I ordered Large in this item - it is, however very tight, smaller in fact than a National Medium thumb pick"}
{"source": "Essentially a waste of money"}
{"source": "I have a gibson les paul that I bought used"}
{"source": " When it arrived the fretboard was in good shape, but very dry"}
{"source": " I first tried lemon oil and it would work, but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it (its rosewood)"}
{"source": " So I started looking for another solution and found the Gerlitz Guitar honey"}
{"source": "I ordered it and applied it"}
{"source": "  A few hours later I restrung my guitar and started playing and didn't care for the way the fretboard felt"}
{"source": " I think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it wasn't completely dry"}
{"source": " I decided to give it another 24 hours"}
{"source": "The next day the guitar neck looked and played great"}
{"source": " It is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ"}
{"source": " Bends and slides are smoother than ever"}
{"source": "Great product and one that I will continue to use"}
{"source": " If you need a quick treatment before a gig or something, I would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly"}
{"source": " But I would use this in every other regular maintenance situation"}
{"source": "Works as advertised"}
{"source": "  Makes the fretboard look and feel nice! I imagine this stuff will last for quite a long time as well since you only really use this when you're changing your strings"}
{"source": "this capo helps make aesome music, thankful for it, i like using it for all kinds of palying, like at the beach"}
{"source": "this makes winding strings MUCH faster, but it does feel flimsy, and the end piece doesn't fit over my tuing pegs correctly, so it's a bit of a haslle getting started"}
{"source": " Other than that it's great for the price, but not a must have"}
{"source": "Dr"}
{"source": " Duck's Ax Wax works great on all of my guitars, including my Nitro finished ones"}
{"source": "  Can be hard to remove if you use too much, so apply only a few drops at a time"}
{"source": "This was recommended by a guitar repair shop, and I have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand"}
{"source": "  It will polish, and lube things like Floyd Roses"}
{"source": "  Do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil?  Wipe them down with a little DR"}
{"source": " Duck's Ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case"}
{"source": "  The secret is always use the least you can get away with"}
{"source": "  Too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever"}
{"source": "Use very little of this"}
{"source": " Rub it on and it then dries like wax then buff it off"}
{"source": " It also lubes your strings"}
{"source": " Good all around product"}
{"source": "Does it all"}
{"source": "  Perfect for cleaning and waxing guitar; don't need a bunch of different items; this does it all"}
{"source": "I dunno, cause I'm stingy with stars"}
{"source": "  These have a nice sound"}
{"source": "  I had an old guitar I bought for cheap at a garage sale for my son (8 at the time) to play on, but never really cared for it"}
{"source": "  I finally got it out and started to tune it, but the steel strings broke"}
{"source": "  SO I replaced with these"}
{"source": "  It's a classic guitar, it shouldn't have had steel strings to begin with"}
{"source": "great sounding strings"}
{"source": " you can hear the difference once it is used"}
{"source": " i will try to buy another one after i have proven its performance"}
{"source": "I have a Don Pablo Cuban guitar, made in 1969,, for a few months,,, never change the strings,, and sounds great,,, I put this strings,, and wao,,know sounds wonderful,, few guitarist fellows could not believe the sound of the guitar after the string change,, try,, this are the best"}
{"source": "I bought a cheap 3/4 guitar that sounded really bad"}
{"source": "  I replaced the stock strings with the D'Addario strings and it made it sound much better"}
{"source": "Used this on my mandolin and it brought back the new instrument sheen it had lost months ago"}
{"source": " I sprayed it on a bit of cheesecloth, used that to rub the instrument down, then wiped with a soft Chamois, worked like a charm"}
{"source": "I love the Dunlop Formula 65 polish and cleaner"}
{"source": " It works really well, and I like the easy to use pump spray mechanism"}
{"source": " I've used other brands in the past, and they had poor spray nozzles"}
{"source": " This one works almost like a mist"}
{"source": " It does a good job of removing smudges and fingerprints"}
{"source": " I spray it directly on the surface of the guitar, and then wipe it off with a flannel cloth"}
{"source": " After I'm done the shine looks glassy and great!"}
{"source": "It has a pleasant smell to it, not harsh at all"}
{"source": " A little goes a long way"}
{"source": " My guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65"}
{"source": " nothing to complain about"}
{"source": "I was looking for a cleaner and a polisher to get the grease and grime off my guitars"}
{"source": " I decided to trythe Dunlop Formula 65 Polish & Cleaner"}
{"source": " I thought, why not try a 2 in 1 formulation? After all, thereare shampoo and conditioners in one bottle, and that works well for me"}
{"source": " So why not this? Possiblyfaulty logic but I went with it at the time"}
{"source": "Well I have to say that it did well"}
{"source": " I used a soft cotton cloth, placed some Formula 65 on the cloth(Not the guitar) and slowly worked on the more oily looking areas of my Gibson ES-339"}
{"source": " This guitarmodel has a high gloss black lacquer finish"}
{"source": " The Dunlop Polisher & Cleaner did a very good job on thefinish and did not leave any streaks behind"}
{"source": "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It was after using the substance all over the guitar that I realized that one must not get Formula 65in any cracks or chips"}
{"source": " I am thankful that I did not have any of said cracks or chips"}
{"source": " I am usually oneto read directions thoroughly; but not this time"}
{"source": " No harm done but I will make it a point to inspect myguitars for cracking or chipping prior to using Formula 65 again"}
{"source": "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This stuff works well"}
{"source": " It was able to lift off, with some effort, greasy build-up over the last year"}
{"source": " I amnot a messy person but oily hands can and often leave smudges that mar the surface of the finish"}
{"source": " Notonly does it clean up the oils from my hands and gosh knows what else, it also left a nice shine as well"}
{"source": "The finish looks very good"}
{"source": " This 4oz bottle will go a long way"}
{"source": " It doesn't take much to work"}
{"source": "I tried using an untreated micro-fiber polish cloth and that only pushed the oily mess around"}
{"source": " That iswhen I decided to get the Dunlop Polisher & Cleaner"}
{"source": " It definitely worked a lot easier than the un-treated micro-fiber cloth"}
{"source": " I am now using the micro-fiber cloth to rub off any new smudges as theyoccur"}
{"source": " I plan to re-apply the cleaner/polisher when I oil my fret board a couple times a year"}
{"source": "I gave the Formula 65 Cleaner & Polisher 4-1/2 stars due to the fact you can potentially do damage toyour guitar"}
{"source": " Chips and cracks do occur throughout the course of a guitar's life and can be expectedalbeit not wanted"}
{"source": " So 4-1/2 stars because it does what it says it will do but you've got to be carefulusing it"}
{"source": " So"}
{"source": "be careful out there people"}
{"source": "NOTE: There is a \"California Propositon 65 Warning\" on the web page under 'Product Details'"}
{"source": " Amazonhas placed it there as a public service"}
{"source": " It reads: \"WARNING: This product contains chemicals knownto the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm"}
{"source": "\" Just thoughtyou ought to know"}
{"source": "This polish works well for what I need it for"}
{"source": " I am not a clean freak but I take good care of my instruments and this works well not only to remove the crud and fingerprints from a gig, but puts a nice shine on the guitar without having to work to hard with the polish to get there"}
{"source": "I like this cleaner - it's gentle on my guitar finish and it doesn't smell bad either"}
{"source": "This is the best guitar cleaner and polish I have ever used"}
{"source": " It cleans the grime and greasy fingerprints off very easilly and leaves a brilliant shine without a waxy/greasy feeling that cream polishes leave"}
{"source": " This is a must for black guitars"}
{"source": " Great product"}
{"source": " Only wish was that is was bigger than 4oz"}
{"source": " It's quite expensive for 4oz"}
{"source": " But 2 or 3 sprays does the whole guitar including the neck"}
{"source": "Took away my fingerprints and dust off my guitar and polished it to a shine that you couldn't see a reflection in yourself!"}
{"source": "It really makes your guitar shine! Also I use it on my guitar neck and fretboard and keeps it smooth and shiny"}
{"source": " 5 stars"}
{"source": " Also the price is right"}
{"source": "I love this product! It is very cheap and the spray bottle makes it very efficient for distributing an even ammout of product on your guitar"}
{"source": "  You end up using just the right ammount"}
{"source": "  Would definately recommend it!"}
{"source": "If there are still people out there who don't believe in magic, just try this"}
{"source": " It has truly elevated my playing a few notches"}
{"source": " I'd probably have bought another bottle already, but this one seems to be lasting forever! I've had it a few months now, I use it pretty much a few times everyday, and it still seems full"}
{"source": "If after using this your playing doesn't improve, then maybe you should give up guitar"}
{"source": "Nice Polish/cleaner  Really works very well on the finishes I have (cheap glossy chinese electrics, and a matte finish acoustic)"}
{"source": "  handy to have when your changing strings (to clean that nasty fretboard- wow do those things get dirty!) Pleasant scent (lemon oil), and no residue"}
{"source": "  Lasts a long time (2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar"}
{"source": "I've relied on this stuff for years, and it has yet to let me down"}
{"source": "  I play my guitars quite frequently, and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat, etc"}
{"source": ", during a show"}
{"source": " A couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self, with zero degradation to the finish"}
{"source": " I've even used this on matte or light finishes with good results"}
{"source": "Tip: a little goes a long way"}
{"source": " I play every week, I use this stuff every time I put away a guitar, and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle"}
{"source": "  I figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month"}
{"source": "  :)"}
{"source": "You can use a standard eye-glass cleaning cloth (about 2 quid) with this instead of buying a micro-fibre cloth (at 5 quid) they both do the same, imo"}
{"source": " You could also use eye-glass cleaning solution instead (which I have in the past) but this special solution works better on the wood and laminate surface of guitars - but not on eye-glasses (smiles)"}
{"source": " This really does shine up your wood quite well"}
{"source": " I recommend"}
{"source": "I am just learning how to play the mandolin, one of the problems I was having was supporting the mandolin and fretting the notes, since I got this strap adjusted I no longer have to hold the neck so I can concentrate on the notes, I like the fact that you can unclip the strap at either end without touching the adjustments so I can put it into my case without having the strap laying across the neck, yet pick it up and with one click it is ready to play"}
{"source": "It's definitely high-tech, but since I don't own a classic-looking or vintage mandolin, I don't really care about looks"}
{"source": " My primary concerns are comfort and function, and this product gets five stars on both counts"}
{"source": " I really like the fact that you can attach the contact points, and using the click-locks, remove the strap from the instrument while leaving the contact points in place"}
{"source": " Also, if you get the strap twisted up while installing it, just undo the click-locks, take out the twist, and reattach it"}
{"source": " Pure function! This strap was very well designed and thought-out before going to manufacture"}
{"source": " Five stars!"}
{"source": "I have three of these straps more my Strats"}
{"source": " Very comfortable and durable"}
{"source": " I really like the metal link as opposed to the plastic link which hold the strap itself to the the leather button hole"}
{"source": " Great product!"}
{"source": "For the price this is a wonderful strap"}
{"source": " It can get twisted and wear out, but keep it straight and it will last you a long time"}
{"source": " It has a vintage look, very soft and comfortable"}
{"source": " It also has that vintage Fender coolness factor"}
{"source": " I have 30+ year old leather straps that will be around years after I'm gone but I paid a lot for them and they're not as comfortable as this"}
{"source": " I've even used these on Gibson's (oh, the shame) but of course they look best on Fender's, I guess"}
{"source": " The truth is they will work on anything"}
{"source": " The strap ends are great, but they're not really secure"}
{"source": " Gaskets can take care of that"}
{"source": " I own quite a few of these are they're great quality, look cool (in a vintage kinda way) and feel soft on my shoulder"}
{"source": "Sorry Fender"}
{"source": "this one is just a waste of money"}
{"source": "  Get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots"}
{"source": "Unlike some other reviewers I have found no quality issues with mine, it came symmetrically bent with a plastic pad that doesn't smell like anything, it holds my harp exactly where it needs to be and is easy enough to remove, all I need to do is loosen the bottom wingnut, rotate the harp away from my mouth, and lift the frame over my head"}
{"source": "To change out harps bite down on your harp, use your hands to depress the tabs on either side and then pull your head back sliding the harp out as you do, to insert a new one place your harp in your mouth, depress tabs and use your mouth to center the harp in between the plates, when it is in position release tabs making sure not to get your lips caught between the harmonica and the plates as they pinch shut"}
{"source": "its cheap//it worx// what more to say?welp"}
{"source": "only other thing to say is ashame that itdoesnt have like a thin brass slip washer with oneof those finned lock washers on the adjustment wingnutsand it'd be perfect!!! (nope"}
{"source": "i still havent found those lilbrass washers that size in my stash so im on the hunt :Dblow-on bruthas n sistas!Doc P"}
{"source": "In case you're wondering about the difference between this Hohner harmonica holder and the Hohners costing more than twice this one's price, this one is made in China while the others are made in Germany"}
{"source": " Now, I'm definitely not one of those who automatically dismiss the quality of Chinese made products"}
{"source": " I have, in fact, many musical items of surprisingly good quality made there"}
{"source": " This item however has some of the good, AND some of the more stereotypical problems of Chinese goods"}
{"source": " Pros: Cheap"}
{"source": " Sturdy"}
{"source": " And unlike some reviewers, I love the taller height"}
{"source": " Far far better for you ergonomically not having to stoop and scrunch your neck and windpipe"}
{"source": " I also like the tighter springs, though that does take a little getting used to"}
{"source": " But the secure feel of your harp is worth the slight extra effort"}
{"source": " Now, the Cons: It's true what others have said: the plastic neck tube smells"}
{"source": " Not as bad as some have said, but an annoying chemical smell is definitely noticeable"}
{"source": " I cut that off and got a big wide replacement tube at TAP Plastics for a buck (make sure the one you get is wide enough to slide over the bends in the neck loop bar thingee - I got the 1/2\" diameter)"}
{"source": " 2nd and perhaps bigger problem is that the metal is NOT bent evenly"}
{"source": " Mine was distinctly taller on one side than the other, and the neck loop was WAY off"}
{"source": " I did my best to bend all parts to even, but the flat metal part is tough to shape"}
{"source": " The reason I didn't return it is that I figure most of them are equally uneven: I just picture a bunch of poor souls slaving away bending these suckers by hand, with little or no machine help to ensure consistency"}
{"source": " With the work I did on it myself, it works fine and is now fairly even, and like I said, the taller height is just about right for me"}
{"source": " It's just annoying that some of the most basic expectations aren't met (like holding your harmonica at an even height on both sides)"}
{"source": " All this said, the bottom line is that I prefer using this OVER my German made Hohner holder because it's better ergonomically (taller), holds my harp more securely, and the traditional dual butterfly nut design just works far better and with less effort than the \"nouveau\" single butterfly nut design of my more expensive German Hohner"}
{"source": " Knowing what I know of its drawbacks, I'm still tempted to pick up another as a back-up or spare"}
{"source": " It's a great deal if you're willing to do a little work on it"}
{"source": "Yes, this pedal is plastic, the switch is not the most durable feeling, and the knob placement is annoying"}
{"source": "  At less than $15, you need to be able to look past these things"}
{"source": "  I've had a higher failure rate with the Dunlop Cry Baby and that thing is built like a cinder block"}
{"source": "  This pedal actually sounds pretty good when used as intended"}
{"source": " Which is to say, this pedal does a nice job in overdriving the preamp tubes in your valve amplifier"}
{"source": "  No brutalz here unless you already have a good amount of gain going"}
{"source": "  No overdrive pedal lives up to it's potential running into a solid state (even modeling) amplifier"}
{"source": "  It's just not what they are really intended to do and they end up sounding buzzy"}
{"source": " Some have complained about RF interference with the use of the FAB pedals (getting radio signals through your amp)"}
{"source": "  I have had that happen with pedals costing 5x the price of the FAB- particularly when running a long pedal chain"}
{"source": "  Based on tone alone, this pedal can overdrive your tube preamp as well as most anything out there under $100"}
{"source": "  Check out the YouTube review of this pedal by a guy that goes by 'intheblues'"}
{"source": "  I believe he uses a DRRI with a strat, and this pedal sounds GREAT"}
{"source": "  If you did a blind test between this pedal and an overdrive costing north of $100 you may be surprised- particularly if your other gear (amp and guitar) are halfway decent"}
{"source": "  What I did note though, was that this pedal has a wee bit more gain and a little less treble than my other TS type pedals"}
{"source": "  That doesn't make it worse or better- just different"}
{"source": "  The 'mid-hump' is actually less pronounced than in a tubescreamer, which is a good thing IMHO"}
{"source": "  There are already enough tubescreamer clones on the market!  It will not perform miracles on lousy sounding guitars and amplifiers"}
{"source": "  Incidentally, the pedal plays well with other dirt boxes"}
{"source": "  Since it isn't true bypass, you will likely get some tone suck if you run a bunch of these in your chain, but if the rest of your pedals have decent bypass you will be fine"}
{"source": "  Lest you mistake me for a novice fanboy with no point of reference for my review- I've been playing guitar since 1979 and have used 'vintage' dirt boxes since before they were vintage and overpriced"}
{"source": "  I am years past caring about the brand and all about getting good sounds from simple gear"}
{"source": "  YMMV-"}
{"source": "Depending on the amp and guitar you have, this pedal is going to either really be great or be a bummer"}
{"source": " It sounds terrific with my fender strat (single coil) Danelectro (lipstick pickups) on my solid state amps, giving them a warm tube like overdrive"}
{"source": "It sounds terrible on my tube amp and my vintage silvertone amp, it really sounds aweful with my 1980's Kramer, loaded with humbucker pickups"}
{"source": "You'll either love it or hate it! That will decide mostly on the type of guitar and amp you use, it's a different pedal with every combination"}
{"source": "This pedal is remarkable for useful tones"}
{"source": " The sound may not be for everyone, but i already have a Boogie for the really metal like distortion"}
{"source": " I needed something that was different but still usable, and I feel this pedal fills the bill"}
{"source": "  The low price tag didn't hurt my feelings either"}
{"source": " This is a win-win buying decision as far as I am concerned"}
{"source": "I use this on my mandolin, it is easy to use once you have the trick of it, first this thing has a long end with eyelets on it (that the other reviewers fear will scratch the neck of their instruments), and a short end (designed to prevent said scratches)"}
{"source": " To use place the capo on your strings with the short end facing you, use your left thumb to hold it in place with the short end dangling just below your thumb, next loop the long end over the back of the neck using your right hand to pull it under the neck and then up toward your thumb, this will trap the short end under the long end and prevent the long ends eyelets from touching your instruments neck, now just rotate your left thumb out of the way so you can buckle the strap in place and you are all set"}
{"source": "I prefer this capo over the other 2 I have because it is so tiny, barely  bigger than the first two joints of my pinkie, and yet it does the job it was designed for, its small size means I can toss it in my mandos hardcase storage box and forget about it till I need it"}
{"source": "The only downside to this is that the elastic will eventually stretch to where it will no longer work, but then again at 5 bucks you can't have everything"}
{"source": "It's very small"}
{"source": "  It's a fabric stretchy capo, the old type, that's quite difficult to stretch and make stay"}
{"source": "  It's made with an end that you stretch the fabric over to connect to hold the capo, but the end isn't very long and I don't trust it to stay while playing for long"}
{"source": "  I'll keep it as a spare, just in case, anyway"}
{"source": "Love that I didn't have to assemble this stand!  Just had to unfold it"}
{"source": " Was easy to adjust and is very stable"}
{"source": " It's nice to be able to sit down at keyboard without having to worry about bumping it"}
{"source": " Also seat fits perfectly under it when not in use"}
{"source": "This is certainly a heavy duty stand!  It weighs quite a bit, is made of solid metal, and I would not hesitate to think it could hold quite a bit of weight"}
{"source": "  However, while it seems stable side-to-side, the spread of the legs does not taper much at all from top to bottom, and I believe it would fall over quickly if bumped from the front or back"}
{"source": "  This makes me nervous for live performances or close quarter practices"}
{"source": "This is a reasonably robust stand that easily carries an 88-key keyboard"}
{"source": "  The front-back spread on the legs is a little too narrow for stage applications, but having room underneath for pedals is a huge improvement over the more-common 'X' stand"}
{"source": "Got these to stop the pegs from slipping in my cheap new violin"}
{"source": "  Added a couple drops, and it worked like a charm"}
{"source": "  A must buy for anyone buying a cheap starter violin"}
{"source": "Wow, this works!  At first, I was a little wary about using the liquidThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsleyon the pegs for apprehension from the warnings that came with the product"}
{"source": "  Being my own bumbling teacher, there was a fear I could damage the finish on my rather inexpensive instrument"}
{"source": "  However, I needed help tuning a couple of balky pegs, so I closed my eyes and blundered ahead (that's just a figure of speech; for I was careful, using the stuff for the first time)"}
{"source": "  With care, cotton and a small rag (torn off my moth eaten underwear) I went ahead, willing to try anything"}
{"source": "  I even removed the strings from the pegs (only one at a time - starting with the inner one first), put the drops on the proper peg locations and restrung the string"}
{"source": "  Tuning then became a breeze"}
{"source": "  To think I used up a great glob of practice time, not fiddling, but tuning"}
{"source": "  Bop! Could'a had a veggie drink!"}
{"source": "These drops are not just a convenience"}
{"source": " In my opinion they are a neccessity for beginning violinists"}
{"source": " If you are reading this wondering if you should consider buying this product to stop your tuning pegs from slipping, or to make them turn smoother and in less dramatic tuning jumps, the answer is yes"}
{"source": " Buy this, it does work, and it works very well"}
{"source": "Even though the instructions said to put a drop on two different places on each peg, I wanted to go light just in case, so at first I only put 1 drop on each peg"}
{"source": " I didn't know what to expect and you can always put more on, but too much could be a bad thing"}
{"source": " Also, each instrument is different, each peg is different"}
{"source": " I had one very stubborn peg, while the others were just the normal level of obnoxious about slipping"}
{"source": " You may only need 1 drop on some pegs and the reccomended 2 drops on the others"}
{"source": " I had new strings on, which of course are going to take forever to stretch out and will need constant tuning"}
{"source": " I did not remove the strings, I just loosened the pegs a little and pulled them out a tiny bit, one at a time, then put the first drop on the spot where the peg would make contact when put back in (on the tuning head side of the peg, the part you actually turn)"}
{"source": " I put the 2nd small drop on the dead end of the peg (not the end you turn)"}
{"source": " Be careful when applying that you don't get more than 1 small drop at a time"}
{"source": " This stuff spreads out over time, a tiny drop goes a long way"}
{"source": " One bottle should last you a very long time"}
{"source": "What to expect: With one drop the effect is immediate"}
{"source": " You will notice the pegs turn smoother and hold their position much better"}
{"source": " After playing for awhile I decided to put a 2nd drop on each peg (as suggested by the included instruction sheet)"}
{"source": " This helped them all to stay in place even better than before"}
{"source": " The pegs now also turn smoother and easier and I can tune much easier than before, in smaller more accurate adjustments, and the strings actually hold the tuning for much longer than before"}
{"source": "Great product"}
{"source": " Buy it, use it, and be happy"}
{"source": "My pegs have been giving me difficulty for a while, and have been temperamental and subject to slipping for as long as I can remember"}
{"source": " I'd guess they have about 100 years of wear on them"}
{"source": "I used to be able to deal with it"}
{"source": " Violin teachers and techs I knew never suggested that the pegs were a problem"}
{"source": " More recently, I tried adding fine tuners on G D and A to make it easier to tune, but the resultant shortening of the strings affected the sound too much"}
{"source": " I figured I'd give the drops a try"}
{"source": "  The change was immediate"}
{"source": " I was able to work with the pegs more easily, and slippage went away immediately"}
{"source": " I decided to give it 24 hours before changing strings"}
{"source": " When I did, I also removed three fine tuners and still had the control I needed"}
{"source": "After changing one string, things worked well, but then I had the peg slip suddenly"}
{"source": " I figured I'd try retuning and that perhaps it was my fault, but it ended up slipping loose again"}
{"source": " I tried reapplying peg drops, and that seemed to fix the problem"}
{"source": " After that, I had no more slippage, but I now have one peg that is binding"}
{"source": "The instructions are clear but minimal and open ended"}
{"source": " I don't expect them to tell exactly how often to use the drops but they could have given a bit more info on what to expect, what symptoms indicate, and so forth"}
{"source": " I tried contacting the manufacturer with a few brief questions, but never heard back"}
{"source": "Suffice to say the drops made an incredible difference, but did not provide me with a foolproof instant cure"}
{"source": " I'd definitely recommend them, but I hope to get some comments from users with more experience so I can have a better idea what makes people know it's time to reapply and what they experience when they do it"}
{"source": "The advantage of good peg control is that you can get high quality gut or synthetic (not metal core) strings and be able to tune them precisely without tonal problems being introduced by fine tuners"}
{"source": "  The effort I had without the drops made me avoid playing and I was using a Yamaha SV-120 most of the time"}
{"source": " That can be fun, but I didn't realize how much I missed the richness of an old acoustic violin that stayed in tune"}
{"source": "It has a tinney sound to it But for 200 dollars or less I would rate this has a Top of the Line low end guitar"}
{"source": "For any beginner this is the guitar I would but in there hands"}
{"source": "I still write all my songs on this and play it more then my !000 dollar american strat or 500 dollar ibanez"}
{"source": "I am disabled, a disabled Vietnam Vet, and my mobility is becoming more limited every winter"}
{"source": "  My wife bought me this for Christmas, thinking I needed a new hobby to keep me busy during the harsh winter months"}
{"source": "I am so happy she did"}
{"source": "  My first thought was \"Now I have to learn how to play this thing\""}
{"source": "  I am so glad she chose this particular guitar for me to start with"}
{"source": "  I now own 26 guitars and have even built 2 custom guitars"}
{"source": "  I always get carried away with new projects and can already play quite well, or so I'm told"}
{"source": "  I practice a lot"}
{"source": "Now about the guitar"}
{"source": "  I wanted to wait until I knew a little something before I reviewed it"}
{"source": "  First, I don't know how they sell these for the price they do"}
{"source": "  It is a very high quality piece, comparable to guitars in the thousand dollar price range"}
{"source": "The action is nice and low, good especially for a beginner"}
{"source": "  I did find just the perfect strings and it made a world of difference"}
{"source": "  I use light D'Addaro strings and love the tone and feel"}
{"source": "The Yamaha is solid wood everywhere, no laminate as you'd expect for this price"}
{"source": "  The tone is fantastic, the finish is flawless and tough"}
{"source": "  It sounds great gently playing or really getting down and rough with it"}
{"source": "  I have been strumming vigorously for over four months now and not a mark is on the guitar"}
{"source": "  I have been playing many other guitars, all electric as well and am looking at a high end acoustic now, but will always keep my first"}
{"source": "  There is no reason for me to need another acoustic, I just will because I can"}
{"source": "This Yamaha has great tuners and stays in tune well, rarely having to make an adjustment once the strings are stretched"}
{"source": "The neck is nice, though a bit thick so I cheat sometimes with my thumb on the low E"}
{"source": "  The set-up was perfect with this and I just can't see where it's going to take much if any maintenance over the years other than replacing strings as needed"}
{"source": "The Yamaha came with a great hard case, tuner, pics and other goodies as a package and was very inexpensive"}
{"source": "  I did put a nice soft leather strap with a quick disconnect on it as there is no front strap button but no big deal there"}
{"source": "If you're looking for a nice acoustic or thinking about taking up playing, this would be a great place to start"}
{"source": "  I see these selling used for what I paid for mine new so you're bot going to lose money on it either"}
{"source": "  Read the other reviews, this is a really nice value"}
{"source": "  It is still my only acoustic that I own, my other 25 guitars are all electrics or project guitars"}
{"source": "  I do have my eye on a Martin though"}
{"source": "5 PLUS stars for this one"}
{"source": "  If you're considering it, buy it"}
{"source": "  You will not regret it"}
{"source": "  I still play this on almost every day"}
{"source": "This is a very nice guitar, the finish and construction is high quality"}
{"source": " The hardware is what you would expect from a Yamaha product"}
{"source": " I really can't think of anything negative to say about it"}
{"source": " It did not come with a strap button, sO I had to install my own, but that is true with just about every acoustic guitar"}
{"source": "I purchased this guitar about a year ago and the thing's still kickin, not planning on replacing it anytime soon"}
{"source": "Once I got some new strings put on this beauty sounded like a singing angel, action was fine for me out of the box"}
{"source": "Most definitely one of the best &#34;bang-for-your-buck&#34; acoustic guitars"}
{"source": "This one is probably closer to a $150 guitar"}
{"source": " The fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it's just like most of the other made in China guitar"}
{"source": " From the reviews I was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but I'm not at all impressed"}
{"source": " One thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none"}
{"source": "I recently bought a Johnson JG-610-N, a Johnson JG-620-N, a Bristol BD-16, a Jasmine S35, and this Yamaha"}
{"source": " If I'd only played the Yamaha I'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side I can definitely say it's not at all amazing"}
{"source": " The Bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better"}
{"source": " The Johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish"}
{"source": " The Jasmine is nice but I haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review"}
{"source": "The Yamaha FG700GS is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low end punch"}
{"source": " Now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great"}
{"source": " The Bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison"}
{"source": " Also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the Yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same"}
{"source": "Can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit \"hive mind\" where everybody buys into a hype"}
{"source": " Maybe I got a dud guitar, but I doubt it, they're all made in the same factory"}
{"source": "Now I can create charts no the fly quickly and have perfectly straight lines"}
{"source": "  5 frets allows enough room for more complicated chords or even scales"}
{"source": "  A must have for guitar teachers IMHO"}
{"source": "This is a very stable, comfortable seat"}
{"source": "  The legs are easily removable for storage"}
{"source": " Love that it is rated for higher weights so I don't have to worry about it collapsing"}
{"source": "i used to only be able to play my keyboard for up to an hour before feeling uncomfortable, this chair has fixed that"}
{"source": "I'm in a situation where I have to sit to play due to hip problems, and it has been tough finding the right on stage seat"}
{"source": "  For me, a stool is too high, and a folding chair too low, plus I need something that folds in with my other equipment"}
{"source": "On it's tallest setting, this gives me the exact height I need"}
{"source": " I'm 6', so it might not be high enough for a very tall person"}
{"source": "It is also sturdy, I'm very animated when I play, and the support feels solid after several gigs of 2 to 3 hours"}
{"source": " The cushioning is nice and thick as well"}
{"source": "I bought this to connect a Technics TT with an Audio Technica cartridge to my newer Onkyo receiver with no phono input"}
{"source": " The unit did work but I had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume"}
{"source": " In addition I have an Onkyo M3040 connected to the receiver that I use for as a zone 2 amplifier"}
{"source": " With this preamp I am getting some serious spikes into the amp"}
{"source": " They are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop"}
{"source": " I do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp"}
{"source": "This unit may work perfectly fine with a Behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all"}
{"source": " I am returning it"}
{"source": "I bought this to replace a Behringer UCA202"}
{"source": " The Behringer performs very well for my use (guitar in a home studio), but recently it's become way too sensitive to interference; I was getting noise from the nearby cable modem / router / network drives"}
{"source": " This noise was making its way to my recordings too :-(For what ended up being less than twice the price of the Behringer I decided to try this unit"}
{"source": " Not only is it interference-free, it has a much warmer, intimate sound"}
{"source": "It's USB powered, installs automatically in about a minute under Win7 with no issues"}
{"source": " I did go to the Lexicon website and get their driver, though, just to be on the safe side"}
{"source": "REAPER had new entries for the device in the  audio settings panel (ASIO! :-) )"}
{"source": " Everything just works great, first time"}
{"source": " I was even able to remove my little mixer from my entire setup thanks to the zero-latency monitoring on the device :-)Great unit"}
{"source": " I love the Behringer, but this thing kicks it in the tail"}
{"source": "The hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate"}
{"source": "  Make sure you have a good microphone to use with it"}
{"source": "  The Cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for"}
{"source": "  That seems to be a common problem with music recording programs I've seen - heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singer/guitarist"}
{"source": "  This should come with a good &#34;how-to-use&#34; course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications"}
{"source": "This a solid performing unit at this price point"}
{"source": "  I've been using this alongside my laptop for as long as I remember and it works the same as the day I bought it"}
{"source": "  The two line instrument and microphone inputs make this perfect for a beginner or anyone needing a budget interface that works and is easy to use"}
{"source": "My only negative criticism would be the plastic feels a little cheap"}
{"source": "  But this is still a great USB interface for anyone who absolutely cannot spend any more than $60"}
{"source": "I am using it to record my garage band's demo to get us more gigs"}
{"source": " I have been a gigging musician for over 20 years"}
{"source": " Had it a few days and with in a half hour after opening it, I had two guitar tracks, a bass track, and drums tracks (from garageband) all laid down"}
{"source": " Easy to plug in, I am using it with a MacBookPro and garageband"}
{"source": " Very quality recordings so far"}
{"source": " Like it so far"}
{"source": "Edit- Put down some vocals with a cheap shure mic (pg-48) used fx from garageband and got a nice vocal track, easy to layer over harmonies"}
{"source": " Still have yet to mic up a drum kit"}
{"source": "Still enjoying the product, still amazed at the ease of use"}
{"source": " Did try to install software on a PC with Vista, no luck"}
{"source": "Edit - Mic'd up a drum kit into a mixer, lined it out to this interface, I then mixed the drum mics with the mixer"}
{"source": " You can record the drums as a single track so once they're recorded you can not mix them individually (ie"}
{"source": " snare, kick and so on)"}
{"source": " I do get very quality recordings with it set up this way"}
{"source": " I am sure a recording engineer could give me better ideas on how to get more out of it, but as for now, I am very pleased"}
{"source": "Boosts the signal without too much noise, though not totally quiet"}
{"source": "  Good for lead w/ single channel amps; boosting signal into effects that vary depending on signal strength--especially at lower practice volumes"}
{"source": "  Should be INEXPENSIVE!"}
{"source": "Ok"}
{"source": "I bought this and after placing it on my pedalboard it was OVERKILL"}
{"source": " I mean I had enough boost and gain from different pedals already so no use for it at the moment"}
{"source": " I gave it to a friend of mine that had a simple pedal configuration (distortion and a flanger) and it made a huge difference when he needed to make a solo or bring some \"accent\" to a determinate part of a song"}
{"source": "It's a cool pedal but I will recommend it for simple pedal configurations"}
{"source": " It will bring the extra juice you need"}
{"source": "Cheers"}
{"source": "I originally bought this pedal to boost an old amplifier signal and it works suprisingly well"}
{"source": " I wanted a boost which didn't color tone and this has worked well for my needs"}
{"source": " The price is good, I bought it locally for the same price here"}
{"source": "Since I have bought this pedal, I have upgraded the speaker in the old amp and still use this to boost the speaker to use with pedals"}
{"source": " The tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great"}
{"source": " I use it with distortion and overdrive with good results"}
{"source": "I have found new uses for my pedals which suffer from volume drop by putting this in front of them"}
{"source": " All in all, besides for a good EQ pedal, this boost is effective and worth every penny"}
{"source": "I cannot shower enough praise on the LPB-1"}
{"source": " It currently sells for about $40 and improves your sound when combined with any other pedal (especially overdrive/distortion pedals) or on its own"}
{"source": " I keep it on all the time, since it always improves sound-quality"}
{"source": "Nice picks with very tasteful pics of hula girls"}
{"source": "  Gave some to my guitar teacher, and thought they were the hoot"}
{"source": "  A pick is pick, there's no doubt about that, but a little art work sort gives it a personality"}
{"source": "This is a great mixer if you are looking to do simple podcasting or solo music production at home"}
{"source": " It's a great little unit"}
{"source": " The only set back is that you can not use Condenser mics with this, without an external phantom power supply, as there is NO phantom power on this unit"}
{"source": " You need to get the 802 model if you need phantom power, otherwise this will work fine with regular XLR or Hi-Z microphones"}
{"source": "(This review is legit)I bought this mixer back in august or september, cant really remember, but i had a horrible experience with this unit, but that's my fault, i bought this mixer without looking at reviews or anything, so i didnt know how to use it"}
{"source": "I hooked this up to my desktop through the pink microphone input, and got a horrible, terrible mix, the hiss from the fan ruined it (i nearly had a panic attack), so i took like 9 months to do research, and found out that behringer made the uca202/uca222 for this unit and the 802 mixer, to remove the hiss and unwanted noise"}
{"source": "So buy this with the uca202/uca222 to clear up your recordings, do not buy a \"rca to 3"}
{"source": "5mm cable\" if your using this for a studio setting like me, and if your beginning like me, do not let these wealthy people fool you, you dont need thousand dollar equiptment, the podcaststudio usb (from behringer) would be fine"}
{"source": "So all in all, with my cheap microphone from radio shack and this mixer, the quality was good, but the hiss ruined it!!!!! Use a usb audio interface with this from behringer, do it, if you want 5 star audio quality! Their website has asio drivers to assist you, ohhh and go on YouTube and search up \"uca202 studio\", you'll get videos to help"}
{"source": "Please, please, please, please do research before you buy anything! Good day everyone! ;D"}
{"source": "I used this one time so far w/my fishman stick and it served the purpose just fine"}
{"source": " am looking forward to using it in the future"}
{"source": "I had read lots of reviews about Behringer, some people had buzz and noises, etc but this is not my case"}
{"source": " I'm not a professional and I just wanted a good mixer to connect my guitar/pedal, my tascam DR-03, my mobile as sometimes I use the Tascam to record, the mobile to reproduce and my guitar to follow"}
{"source": "This mixer works great, NO noise, NO buzz, NO nothing but working as expected"}
{"source": " Great product for entry level and great price for what you get"}
{"source": "Needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer"}
{"source": "  It is limited in what it can do but it does the job"}
{"source": "  I'm rapidly becoming a behringer fan"}
{"source": "  The three points mentioned in another rating (Inputs should be out the back, needs rubber feet, and the led) are spot on"}
{"source": "  I'd also like to see another set of outputs on it as well"}
{"source": "  It could also use being a tad bigger, they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together"}
{"source": "  The LED for the power on this thing is so bright it's obnoxious, it almost blinds you"}
{"source": "  Other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise"}
{"source": "I bought this mixer in order to combine my bass guitar with an mp3 player for silent practice at home"}
{"source": " Bass into one channel, iPod into another, headphones out"}
{"source": "It works!  There are other solutions to this dilemma"}
{"source": "  Pocket-sized headphone amps, and so on"}
{"source": "  But they're a) more expensive and b) kind of junky and c) come equipped with built-in effects and amp models which I do not want"}
{"source": "  YMMV"}
{"source": ")So what's the Behringer XENYX 502 like in this use scenario?1"}
{"source": " The blue power light is blinding"}
{"source": "  First thing I did was put some masking tape on it so that it didn't prevent me from seeing the knobs on the board"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " Speaking of those knobs, they seem a little rickety"}
{"source": "  Be careful jamming this into a gig bag repeatedly"}
{"source": "  I worry that the knobs won't stand up to that kind of treatment for long"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": "  There's no on/off switch, so you'll wind up pulling the power out of the back of the unit when it's not in use"}
{"source": "  Strange for this particular usage scenario"}
{"source": "Overall, I think this unit is a great value for the money"}
{"source": "Behringer products have a kind of shoddy reputation and I was skeptical about paying even ["}
{"source": "] bucks for an 8-input mixer"}
{"source": " My intention for this product was simple yet unorthodox: I wanted to use it for recording a drum set"}
{"source": " I wanted to do it through my M-Audio ProFire 610"}
{"source": " I had 4 mics, 4 stands and a 5 piece drum set"}
{"source": " I love my ProFire610 it is reliable and the preamp is clean and strong"}
{"source": " I have no gripe with it it's just that the preamp only works on two of the 6 inputs, so I figure if I get a mixer I can use ITS preamped channels and run them through the 1/4\" inputs on my interface"}
{"source": " Well, it worked"}
{"source": " It worked GREAT"}
{"source": " Not only did it sound great but I was able to have more control over the sound of each individual mic"}
{"source": " Low noise, great sound and I still had 4 1/4\" inputs on my mixer to play around with"}
{"source": "  With my drum set experiment over I now had an 8 input mixer at my disposal"}
{"source": " Add two monitors and you've got yourself a nice little PA"}
{"source": " There are no BUS outputs so if you're serious about getting a descent mixer I wouldn't bother, but as a starter mixer for the price offered, I couldn't be happier"}
{"source": " It works fantastic for small gigs or (God forbid) house parties"}
{"source": "It may not be the prettiest looking mixer but its a very simple, self explanatory and effective mixer"}
{"source": " I didn't need all the flash and the input/output jacks on the top is WAY better than running them out the back of the unit (I hate that!)"}
{"source": " The EQ setup for each channel is basic: Hi, Mid, Low, FX , Pan and Level"}
{"source": " Having an FX send is awesome when using it live"}
{"source": " I didn't think a tiny little mixer like this would accommodate that"}
{"source": " (the thing is only 9\"x7\") It's also got a control room output with volume which you can use for more monitors if need be ;) The Xenyx 802 is a great buy"}
{"source": " Had I known I would like it this much I would have paid the extra $["}
{"source": "] and gotten the 12 channel one"}
{"source": "For what this does you can't go wrong for the price!  I have a small recording setup and play guitar (and bass) with friends"}
{"source": "  This little mixer gets both of those jobs done right"}
{"source": "  Sure a more expensive mixer might be able to tweek your vocals or instruments more, but all I needed was a way to mix up to 4 inputs at at time and out put to my speakers and laptop for recording"}
{"source": "  It does all of those jobs well"}
{"source": " There is no hum when the unit is on"}
{"source": "  I have two small grips though"}
{"source": "and they are minor"}
{"source": "the EQ isn't that great and the volume to the headphones is lower than I like"}
{"source": "  Maybe I'm going deaf"}
{"source": "I was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs"}
{"source": " It was exactly what I needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer"}
{"source": " For the price it does a very good job"}
{"source": " I don't detect any hum at all and I only get hiss when I crank the volume up too high"}
{"source": " I recommend this mixer for your home studio"}
{"source": " It works perfectly with my sound card"}
{"source": " You do NOT need USB to get this to work"}
{"source": "This mixer is just what I've been looking for"}
{"source": " The 8 inputs makes it very versatile for different projects"}
{"source": " This mixer is a little too much for me (considering that I only record with one XLR track & use the outputs for my UCA202 Interface) but it's good to have these extra inputs just in case I want to stretch my &#34;creativity"}
{"source": "&#34; Anyways, this is an amazing mixer for the price! Anyone just getting into making music and recording needs one! Guaranteed amazing'ness!"}
{"source": "Behringer makes quality products - I purchased the excellent C-1 Condenser Microphone, and replaced the 302usb with the Xenyx 802 mixer board"}
{"source": "When I researched items for a simple home recording setup, I saw all of the positive reviews for this smaller mixer, and read the item description here on Amazon and the Behringer website for the C-1 mic included what turned out to be a misleading statement about how it would work with any of the Behringer phantom-powered mixer boards"}
{"source": "That was incorrect information - this board receives power only via USB and doesn't provide adequate phantom power for condenser mics (48v)"}
{"source": "When I setup the return of this board to Amazon, I informed of the error, and the appear to have acted very promptly on it, as the item description for the C-1 on both websites now includes an explicit statement about the need for 48 volts"}
{"source": "Although this correction is good, it would be more helpful to customers if Behringer would also correct the description about this board associated with its wording about its phantom power capabilities to state what kinds of mics it will adequately power"}
{"source": "I've noticed in other venues (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " musician and sound forums) Behringer gets a bad rap"}
{"source": " I don't think its due to poor quality equipment, I think its due to frustration about a lack of information provided to customers both before and after the sale"}
{"source": " Neither the Behringer website nor the included documentation with the items I bought is adequate for customers like myself who are not sound experts"}
{"source": "Running 4 mics, samples and the odd phone call into one device for recording was a bit daunting"}
{"source": "  This mixer handles it all perfectly"}
{"source": "  I'm literally knew nothing about it when it arrived (first time I'd ever seen a mixer of any kind) in terms of usage but managed to figure it out quickly, get hiss free, nicely panned, beautifully warm sounds that have helped make my podcasting sound wonderful, professional and frankly better than I could have imagined"}
{"source": "  I didn't need the 'FX' "}
{"source": " but the the other was out of stock :D I'll get to them one day"}
{"source": "I wish it had a power button"}
{"source": "The mixer arrived early, which was a life-saver"}
{"source": "  I immediately put it to use at a musical venue in which all four microphone pre-amps were used for three vocalists and one flute, and the CD input was connected to a computer that was playing a minus track for the vocalists"}
{"source": "  Everything functioned well and the medium reverb effect performed well on all inputs"}
{"source": "  I am looking forward to using more of the effects"}
{"source": "This is one of the quietest mixers I've ever used"}
{"source": " The range of adjustability is excellent"}
{"source": " 12 channels fill up quickly, but I've mixed 10 at a time and nearly no noise (at least I don't hear any)"}
{"source": "I own the Behringer Xenyx 1202FX, which is essentially this model but costs about 20 dollars more for the FX (it comes with 100 set effects)"}
{"source": " I have been doing home recording with Cubase and Logic, using a Presonus Firebox audio interface, with both MIDI, vocals and instruments, and didn't use a mixing board, but eventually decided to try one out given that (a) they are making them at very reasonable prices and (b) I had more inputs and outputs than the Firebox could easily handle"}
{"source": "This mixing board didn't look that impressive to me when I first checked it out, but having set it up and used it, it operates very well and cleanly"}
{"source": " The fact that it comes with four mic inputs and preamps is a plus"}
{"source": " The fact that it does not have an on/off switch is a minus"}
{"source": " But basically it works well, the EQ is useful, and it has a large number of inputs and outputs for such a small mixer"}
{"source": " Behringer makes a range of models with less/more inputs to suit one's needs, so this is great"}
{"source": " Also, having a dedicated mixer makes it easier for me, as I can leave all my inputs connected and just adjust things on the mixer depending on what I want to record"}
{"source": " Another small thing that is mixing is a button that cuts out the line altogether -- you have to turn it down to zero"}
{"source": " And, there are no faders (except the main); instead it uses knobs for everything"}
{"source": " Well, I would have liked some of these things, but then I would have to pay more, and what I really wanted was functionality at a good price, and that is what the Behringer Xenyx has delivered thus far"}
{"source": "By the way, I am running the following through the mixer: an AT3035 audiotechnica condenser mic, an Alesis QS8"}
{"source": "1, guitar via line-in (or mic'd), two KRK RP5 studio monitors, Presonus Firebox"}
{"source": " Everything's been working and sounding great thus far"}
{"source": "The effects on this mixer have not been very useful to me, since I am running Logic, but if I ever use it live, which I may do, I'd imagine they'd come in handy"}
{"source": " The effects are just so-so in terms of sounds: usable, but not that great, in my opinion"}
{"source": "Behringer has had a somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians so I was a bit apprehensive about buying this unit but so far, so good"}
{"source": "  The mic preamps sound pretty good - clean and relatively quiet"}
{"source": " The knobs and slider feel smooth and well made"}
{"source": "It also seems to send hotter signal to my JBL EON 510s and that's a good thing"}
{"source": "The built-in effects are probably its weakest point"}
{"source": "  I've heard some really cheap digital reverbs that are much smoother than this unit"}
{"source": "I also wish that the Control Room knob and outputs were independent of the Main Output slider"}
{"source": "  That would definitely make it a lot more practical but then again, it would also turn it into a 4 buss mixer"}
{"source": "  So all in all, not too shabby for a $110"}
{"source": "00 mixer but I probably wouldn't use it for recording"}
{"source": "Considering the price is so cheap on these, I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio"}
{"source": " To say that I used it \"rarely\" is an understatement - maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges"}
{"source": " That said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume ALL the way up"}
{"source": "Aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well"}
{"source": " However, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works"}
{"source": "Pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero"}
{"source": "This mixer has four mic inputs"}
{"source": " It has some fun effects"}
{"source": " This mixer comes with a 80Hz filter and a 3-band equalizer on the mic channels"}
{"source": " It has a FX-send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono"}
{"source": " I do not hear any external noise"}
{"source": " It has a durable metalic case"}
{"source": "  This mixer has great audio"}
{"source": "I was actually trying to buy the smaller Xenyx when I bought this one, but I'm so glad I got this model"}
{"source": " Unbelievable amount of flexibility built into it"}
{"source": " I use with the UCA202 audio interface and the Audio-Technica AT2035 for recording on my PC with Audacity every day since I unpacked it with no problems"}
{"source": " Makes a perfect small studio combination!"}
{"source": "I own the Behringer Xenyx 1202FX, which is essentially this model but costs about 20 dollars more for the FX (it comes with 100 set effects)"}

{"source": " Since I'm using Logic, the effects are basically unnecessary, but if I ever want to use the board for live use, which I may do, they could come in handy"}
{"source": " I'd say the effects are just so-so"}
{"source": "I am giving this item 5 stars because it is awesome litle mixer, was not expecting much for the price but this little unit (it is very small) as I went from  Mackie 1202 to the Berhinger 1202 (anyone see a similarity here), this is basically the same as the Mackie mixer but slightly smaller, recieved it, hooked it up and it worked perfect, few minor adjustements and sounded as good as the Mackie, perhaps better, plus it took up less space on my desk"}
{"source": " Only weird thing about this unit and it has been mentioned before is no ON & OFF switch, why?"}
{"source": "problem solved by using a power strip and using the power strip to power the unit on and off, the only other way to power it on & off is by unplugging it from the back to turn it on, and plugging it back in to turn it on, using the power strip to avoid much wear and tear on the power source connector, this was really stupid of Behringer, never ever had any kind of mixer without a power on & off button"}
{"source": " All in all for the price, I should not complain much, will pick up another for my daughters studio as it is that good"}
{"source": "As LC condenser it's definitely a light weight, but for lesse than a $100 bucks it sounds pretty good"}
{"source": "Used on acoustic guitar with less than satisfatory results, but got a great sound out of a violin and a fairly decent voice sound"}
{"source": "Looking forward to more tests"}
{"source": "when given a budget for cheap microphones, the odds are that you cant afford to make a mistake by buying this one"}
{"source": " I like the fact that it adds a deeper, bassier tone to any voice but it's missing clarity"}
{"source": " If you want the low tone but also treasure your clarity, spend 30 dollars less and get an MXL 990 instead"}
{"source": " it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case"}
{"source": " I hooked the 990 up to a cheap ART Tube MP preamp and after letting a few vocalists experiment with it, they agreed that the 990 was clearly superior to the V67G that was hooked up to much more expensive preamp"}
{"source": " Some vocalists actually prefer the MXL 990 over a couple of my Shure condenser microphones"}
{"source": "bought this for a modest step up in vocal tracks for home recording on my 24 bit neo 2488"}
{"source": "Ive been using the mxl990"}
{"source": " mic would be great for the price if it wasnt defective"}
{"source": " used it forabout 30 minutes before crackling and static started"}
{"source": " had to go back to the 990 until all of thereturn and warranty is taken care of"}
{"source": " i still recommend the mic though"}
{"source": " it is hotter than the 990in its highs, but with good compression, power amp and eq the result is well worth the money"}
{"source": "This mic is really nice"}
{"source": " I have used it on many recordings and it still amazes me that it can sound so great"}
{"source": " Works great on voice overs, singers, and rappers"}
{"source": "That said, it won't outperform the mics you would encounter in studios today, but with a little tweaking, and the right preamp, this mic can sound great"}
{"source": "There was one review that mentioned it isn't for female vocalists"}
{"source": " I've only used it on one and it sounded great, not as good as the one I used in studio, but it worked in a pinch for overdubbing with no studio time available"}
{"source": "I am not a studio engineer, nor am I a professional musician"}
{"source": "  I record songs in my home as a hobby"}
{"source": "  I like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting, so if you're at or around the same level, you know what I'm talking about"}
{"source": "  Will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much?  No"}
{"source": "  Are you likely to find it in a high-end professional studio?  Eh"}
{"source": "probably not"}
{"source": "  Is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point?  Hells yes"}
{"source": "I've worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious, and this is the nicest mic I own right now"}
{"source": "  The difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious"}
{"source": "  I use it for recording vocals, and my voice (again, not a pro!) is finicky to record, usually sounding pretty muddy"}
{"source": "  Even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals (SM57 and 58) this was still the case"}
{"source": "  But with this mic, my voice sounds much more clear and open"}
{"source": "Admittedly, this is a very subjective evaluation, but then aren't all mic evaluations subjective?  You can go on all day about response range and EQ flatness, but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application"}
{"source": "  And to my ears, this mic sounds wonderful"}
{"source": "My only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesn't seem to be a super-tight cardioid, because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it"}
{"source": "  Perhaps this is how it's supposed to be, but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously, it can be a headache trying to jury-rig an isolation method that works"}
{"source": "  I took off a star for this alone, although that may not be fair since I haven't used any other large-diaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if they're all supposed to behave this way"}
{"source": "Really a nice mic"}
{"source": " I did a lot of research before purchasing this for my home studio"}
{"source": " I record acoustic guitar and vocals through this mic and they sound wonderful"}
{"source": " Plenty of low end while still capturing the clear mids and highs"}
{"source": " Makes my voice sound fantastic"}
{"source": " I read a lot of reviews saying that this mic with the right voice works wonders, and it certainly does for mine"}
{"source": "Worth a shot if you're on a budget like me!"}
{"source": "Really a remarkable microphone for around $100"}
{"source": "  Very sensitive "}
{"source": " "}
{"source": " "}
{"source": " its for studio, not live performances"}
{"source": "  Be sure to set your DAW insert on your input channel with a compressor/limiter, as you can easily blow through the volume into clipping"}
{"source": "  Has a rich warm tone, like tube mics"}
{"source": "  Compares to a Audio Tech 2020, not in the class of say an Audio Tech 4040"}
{"source": "  Can't beat it for the price"}
{"source": "This mic is fantastic! I've been singing, writing, and recording for almost 30 years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive German mics I've used in larger studios over the years"}
{"source": " There's a very slight presence peak, but nothing like most of the other Chinese mics"}
{"source": " It isn't shrilling or peaky at all"}
{"source": " Male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for EQ whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub 100hz stuff"}
{"source": " This mic is also an excellent candidate for a Michael Joly mod, he calls it one of the 7 audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under $200"}
{"source": " Michael mods these mics and you'd be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous U87 with the German name that starts with an \"N\""}
{"source": " I'm using it totally stock and it's been great"}
{"source": " Buy it"}
{"source": "I play an amplified upright acoustic bass and an electric upright solid-body bass"}
{"source": " I bought this Jim Dunlop MC401 MXR because I have a few bass solos that can't be heard above the other players unless I boost volume, which was hard to do by reaching for the volume knob on my preamp or amp with my hand"}
{"source": " This stomp box lets me instantly add a pre-selected amount of volume boost only--no goofy effects, no hum, no extraneous sounds at all"}
{"source": " Of course, when the solo is over, another click with my foot drops the boost"}
{"source": " This thing sounds completely transparent when it's off, and completely natural when it's on"}
{"source": " For my purposes, a boost of five decibels out of the 20 that this device permits seems to be enough"}
{"source": " Naturally, you have to have left some head room available in your amp otherwise you won't hear any volume change or you'll get distortion or both, but that should be obvious--it's just like turning your amp up, except with your foot"}
{"source": "The MC401 runs on a 9-volt battery, but I also separately ordered the Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter, which is also available at Amazon"}
{"source": " I checked the Jim Dunlop website and in its FACs it specifically recommends staying with the same voltage adapter, so I did not order the ECB004, which is an 18-volt model"}
{"source": " The ECB003 adapter works perfectly and seems completely silent"}
{"source": "The MC401 is compacl, but it's heavily-constructed so it stays put"}
{"source": " The stomp switch itself appears to be made of good steel, as is the case itself"}
{"source": " Everything is solid as a rock"}
{"source": " I don't see how it could be better"}
{"source": " Perfect"}
{"source": "A very good pedal that you miss only when its off"}
{"source": " Super transparent and boosts your signal after all the degradation through your cables"}
{"source": " To my ears it restores the high end and shimmer and brings back life to the note"}
{"source": " Best used after all your pedals right before it goes into your amp"}
{"source": "I figured I would take 2mins out of servicing the line of ladies that formed after receiving this pic to do a review"}
{"source": "  The pics shape and thickness is actually perfect (TWSS) for playing and gripping"}
{"source": "  Also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing"}
{"source": "  I would suggest getting two packs since you will need 1 pick and the other 11 can go to the children you fathered due to this pic"}
{"source": "1 Digital Drumset, 1 Electronic guitar, 1 microphone (non XLR), and a Keyboard"}
{"source": "  I got the Brady Bunch Musical here"}
{"source": "  This mixer works great"}
{"source": " No complaints, just works!  All connections are 1/4\" mono"}
{"source": "light construction but  you get what you pay for"}
{"source": "  so far it has functioned well and I do use it a lot"}
{"source": "  it would be nice if it remembered what channel it was last on so when you power cycle it doesnt switch on you"}
{"source": "  I mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments"}
{"source": "  I have not noticed any sound degradation from using it"}
{"source": "  the volume knobs are handy for sure!!"}
{"source": "I bought this to make it easier to switch guitars on the job (I often go from an electric to an acoustic or a Gibson humbucker loaded guitar to a single coil Fender)"}
{"source": " For that one job it works well with no noticeable noise in my VOX VT-30 amp"}
{"source": " Other reviewers said that the two level controls only work if are using this pedal for a one in to two out situation (one guitar to two amps)"}
{"source": " That is definitely correct"}
{"source": " In a two in (two guitars to one amp) situation only one level control works which isn't bad if you need to compensate for any volume loss from the pedal"}
{"source": " For $25"}
{"source": "00 it a pretty useful pedal"}
{"source": "A quick word about Behringer stuff"}
{"source": " I have several Behringer pedals and other Behringer equipment"}
{"source": " I never had a problem with their stuff"}
{"source": " Not once"}
{"source": " I often read these reviews that complain about the low quality of Behringer stuff and the plastic case on the effects pedals but I have yet to damage one of the pedals and I admit that I am not that careful with my live equipment"}
{"source": " This stuff is the best bargain on the market"}
{"source": " Are my Behringer Eurolive active P"}
{"source": "A"}
{"source": " speakers as good as my Mackie SRM450 speakers"}
{"source": " No, but the Behringers cost about $250"}
{"source": "00 each while my Mackie's cost twice as much"}
{"source": " If money is not a problem you should go with the bigger name brands but often at three to four times the cost and with only minor improvements"}
{"source": "I am a weekly player and have been for 40 years"}
{"source": " I wish this stuff had been around when I first started playing"}
{"source": "This selector is very basic but does the job, if you need an A/B box for simple set ups give this one a try, it works for me and I dont see anything wrong with it, is simple, affordable and functional, what else can you ask for?"}
{"source": "This pedal, in short, sucks"}
{"source": "  There's no point to having an A/B pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound"}
{"source": " Behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this"}
{"source": "Not expensive"}
{"source": " Not cheap"}
{"source": " Not exactly what I wanted"}
{"source": "Like most all of the Behringer items it has good points and \"duh\" points"}
{"source": "If you use it as an  A/B one input to 2 outs, then you can use the 2 volume controls"}
{"source": "  I did not need it for that"}
{"source": "If you use it as 2 inputs and 1 out, you only control the sum out, not the individual inputs (thought you could, which is why I bought it"}
{"source": " the 1/2 page twice translated fact sheet almost makes you think you can, but you can not"}
{"source": " I almost sent them back"}
{"source": " I bought 2 for a special set up needing to adjust the 2 input levels that I was switching)"}
{"source": "the LED indicators when using it as a 2 in - 1 out  (like 2 guitars into one amp, or in my case a mando and a midi-guitar rig into a single line in ) "}
{"source": "  are "}
{"source": "exactly backwards"}
{"source": "  the one on the right (red) is actually the input on the left and the one on the left ( green) is the input on the right"}
{"source": " which makes it about as confusing to use as getting a weinersnitchel coupon that is good only at a sushi restaurant"}
{"source": "Operation wise, no hums, no buzzes but no one left on bass"}
{"source": "When it is all said and done, I am glad I kept them"}
{"source": "Amazon rocks"}
{"source": " got them in 3 days"}
{"source": " free shipping"}
{"source": "  where else can you take the change you find in the couch to coinstar, get a coupon with no fee and buy musical toys"}
{"source": "  who said Santa was a scrouge"}
{"source": "  i am just glad he took a nap and the money fell out of his pocket"}
{"source": "Any time a person buys an A/B box their only real expectation is to have it switch quietly, this unit is as quiet as them come"}
{"source": "  For the price it can't really be beat"}
{"source": "well what can I say"}
{"source": "  it takes a signal and splits it 4 ways offering output at HP level"}
{"source": " genius"}
{"source": "  I bought it for my church since we're going the HP monitoring route and this was my best bet against the super over priced shure/senheiser/audio technica overpriced systems"}
{"source": " I paired this up with the MA400 and it works great"}
{"source": " hook up an xlr straight from the DI and voila, you got both inputs with separate control"}
{"source": " like I said"}
{"source": " genius"}
{"source": "I use this in my recording studio to allow musicians their own level of monitoring in their headphones for recording and playback"}
{"source": " So far I've had this item for about a week, and it has worked flawlessly, and given the exact results I needed"}
{"source": " Musicians love being able to control their own headphones, rather than having the engineer in the control room raise and lower their levels"}
{"source": "Do not let the size fool you"}
{"source": " This is a very handy piece of equipment and it's so easy to set up and use"}
{"source": " Just plug a 1/4 inch stereo cable into your sub out on your mixer and then into the HA400, then plug in up to 4 pairs of headphones and your set to track overdubs"}
{"source": " This is perfect for a small home studio on a budget and it's built like a tank"}
{"source": " Be forewarned that this a very basic headphone distribution system, you can only adjust volume from the HA400 and it would be wise to purchase a real long 1/4 stereo cable and extensions for the headphones if you want to isolate vocals"}
{"source": "Behringer doesn't have the best of reputations, but some of their gear does a great job at the price"}
{"source": " This is one of them"}
{"source": " This gives me plenty of clean volume to run my headphones"}
{"source": " I run a project studio with an Apogee Duet as my interface"}
{"source": " I needed this because sometimes I need to monitor something while another person in the room is recording/monitoring a track"}
{"source": "My main headphones are Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro, Sennheiser HD 555, Sony MDR-V6, and then I have some others"}
{"source": " All of my headphones are comfortably driven by this headphone amp with plenty of gain on tap and I get very good volume, and even at the exact same volume as the input, I find that the sound is improved by using this headphone amp"}
{"source": " It's hard to describe, but it just feels a bit fortified and a little bit stronger"}
{"source": " I've had a Presonus headphone amp before that cost many times as much as this little Behringer headphone amp and the sound was no better"}
{"source": "The volume pots are very smooth and there is no noise that I can hear that is introduced by this amp"}
{"source": " Make sure you use a quality sound source because this will faithfully amplify anything that goes in"}
{"source": " For instance, if I run a cable from my iMac's built-in headphone output to this amp and turn up the volume, I can hear a little buzz and random digital sounds, but that's not the amp, it's the source"}
{"source": " Running the output from my Apogee Duet, the sound is very clean and strong"}
{"source": "There are some annoying things about this amp"}
{"source": " Obviously the external power supply is annoying, there's no on-off switch, and it's light enough that when everything is plugged in, it doesn't want to stay in place"}
{"source": " However, that's nothing that Velcro tape on the desk can't fix, and the rest of the problems are stuff you have to live with when you get something that does so much for less than the price of a decent pair of headphones"}
{"source": "I use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out"}
{"source": "  Individual volumes controls make it perfect"}
{"source": "I've owned and used this for a few years now without failure or flaw"}
{"source": "  The pots all still work without adding noise, and in general the device does exactly what I need it to do"}
{"source": "  You won't find a better deal than this on a basic headphone amp/mixer"}
{"source": "Great pedal- very lush and usable tones"}
{"source": " Think \"Lightning Crashes\" by the band \"Live\""}
{"source": " Ok, I was going to initially give it 4 stars because of the following reasons:  plastic knobs, foot switch does not 'click', very miniscule volume drop with engagement (actually, I moved the pedal to a different spot in my signal chain and I *think* that resolved the volume issue, but I can't tell-  I guess if it is too close to tell, then it's a non issue !)"}
{"source": " Then I performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again"}
{"source": "  Metal enclosure"}
{"source": "  Works like a charm"}
{"source": "  Twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping"}
{"source": "  It gets 5 stars because there is nothing even close at this price"}
{"source": "I'd bought this thing several years ago-forget where-as an alternative to the Electro-Harmonics Stone Phaser"}
{"source": " The EH Stone is great, but a) couldn't afford it 2)the adapter input is proprietary, differnt than was on my Boss pedal board3)wasn't gigging out"}
{"source": " So I figured, \"What the heck?\""}
{"source": "I've had fun with it"}
{"source": " With a wah and a proper guitar sound, one can easily emulate the Hendrixish-Univibe sound"}
{"source": " Remeber, guitar, touch, pickups, signal, etc all play into that factor"}
{"source": " Also its a 'Vintage Style', not a mid 80's mosquito tone killing device"}
{"source": " Not a huge range here"}
{"source": " No swooshing jet sounds"}
{"source": " Just good 'ol wobble"}
{"source": "I'll agree with the other guy here and say the durability is questionable, and the size of the thing is annoying by comparison to the standard pedal housing"}
{"source": " And, it does make some noise in my chain"}
{"source": " Lately have been trying different cables, adapters, and batteries"}
{"source": "A tinkerer/hobbyist/modder may enjoy getting a sturdy pedal housing box and putting this things guts into it, and, getting a sturdy switch"}
{"source": " Paint it all weird and call it a 'boutique pedal'"}
{"source": "This device works"}
{"source": "  Here's what it does"}
{"source": "  You plug an electric bass into the pedal's instrument input and then you can plug a second standard instrument cable into the pedal's high impedance output jack and then plug that one into a bass amp"}
{"source": "  You also can connect it to a low impedance microphone preamp via the 200 Ohm low impedance XLR jack out"}
{"source": "  You can use just the high-impedance output or just the XLR output or you can use them both simultaneously"}
{"source": "  When the \"footswitch\" is off it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all just like a direct box"}
{"source": "  When the \"footswitch\" is on an LED light activates and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on"}
{"source": "  I put \"footswitch\" in quotes because I use fingers to push it, but leave it on all the time for my personal purpose"}
{"source": "  When you insert a plug into the instrument input jack the unit powers on, so if running on battery be sure to unplug the input when not actually using it"}
{"source": "Some other functional comments about it"}
{"source": "  It runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9-volt power supply"}
{"source": " I used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter"}
{"source": "  Battery life isn't super but satisfactory"}
{"source": "  Still if using it a lot, I suggest using an AC adapter"}
{"source": "  When the battery starts going it sounds awful, but you could put it into bypass mode to finish the set"}
{"source": "  Also when the \"footswitch\" is off and the LED is not lit, this thing functions as a straight XLR ouput direct box for anything you plug into it"}
{"source": "  You could patch the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board to it and use that to feed a mixer for recording direct which is a very handy feature for the home recording hobbyist!  The amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass, so just use it as a direct box with the tone/emulation circuit off for anything except bass"}
{"source": "The controls are all rotary knobs except the Ground-Lift switch which is a slide switch"}
{"source": " The controls left to right, top row to second row are:  DRIVE, TREBLE, BASS, LEVEL, PRESENCE, GROUND LIFT SLIDE SWITCH and BLEND"}
{"source": "Taking each control one at a time to understand what they do is important because they are not all logically placed"}
{"source": "  The DRIVE knob adjusts the amount of gain similar to cranking the input stage control of the tube preamp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness (or edge) of overdriven tube tone"}
{"source": "  Basically this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasing distortion out there for this purpose"}
{"source": "  There is no ACTIVE/PASSIVE pad switch or extra active input jack on this pedal so if you have an active bass then you will not have to turn the drive knob up as much to get the tone you want"}
{"source": "  The TREBLE knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of upper frequency tones"}
{"source": "  The BASS knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of the lower frequencies"}
{"source": "  12 o'clock is flat (or zero db boost or cut) on both the treble and bass knobs"}
{"source": " The LEVEL knob is the master volume control and all it does is control the output volume with no tonal coloration"}
{"source": "  The PRESENCE knob boosts the upper frequency range harmonic content for more attack in your tone"}
{"source": "  The Presence knob isn't a midrange control, but does boost the upper mids"}
{"source": "  The GROUND LIFT switch only effects the XLR output jack and it should be left \"OFF\" unless you hook it up and there is hum"}
{"source": "  Then you can turn the Ground Lift \"ON\" and it might help eliminate the hum issue"}
{"source": "  However it is better from a safety standpoint to remedy this by eliminating the electrical ground loop conflict that is causing the hum"}
{"source": "  The BLEND knob controls the amount of tube emulation injected into the pedal's output with all the way to the left being none, 12 o'clock being 50% and all the way clockwise being 100%"}
{"source": "CONS:  Very little bass gear, or anything else, is \"PERFECT\" these days"}
{"source": "  Behringer gear has more build issues in general across most of their product line because using Chinese parts and labor is how they keep costs down"}
{"source": "  Designed in Germany but built in China means you get Chinese components and Chinese build quality while the specs look pretty enticing"}
{"source": "  For example at the first battery change the battery clip self-destructed as part of the clip's terminal stayed stuck to the battery having pulled completely out of the clip"}
{"source": "  This was a Duracell battery, the standard for pedal batteries"}
{"source": "  Went to Radio Shack and got replacement battery clips and fixed it with a new clip by soldering wires from the new clip to the stripped wires cut away from the old clip and taping up the solder joint"}
{"source": "  I've never used this as a stompbox because the switch looks like it will break if you lean on it hard"}
{"source": "  Construction is all plastic"}
{"source": " The casing is very durable but based on previous experience with plastic switches on stomp boxes I know not to use my size 13-D foot on it"}
{"source": "  The Treble and Presence knobs on mine will generate hiss and noise when set very high which may not be noticeable at all on a vintage type bass amp with no tweeter but becomes glaring when using a full range amp and cabinet or when using the XLR output for recording or a PA feed"}
{"source": "  Basically I set the Treble and Presence to the point where I hear hiss start, then back off until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit"}
{"source": "  Hiss is no issue in bypass mode because the preamp is off"}
{"source": "  The jacks, other than the XLR, are the plastic box jacks that are soldered direct to the circuit board of the pedal, These type jacks are noted for causing problems, especially after rough use so take it easy with them and they should last a very long time"}
{"source": "  This unit lacks any dedicated MIDRANGE knob but the Presence knob does seem to boost upper mids and treble simultaneously"}
{"source": "  Some people who use this pedal as a stage-tool use it as a solo or \"scoop\" switch for slap & tap solos so the presence, bass and treble boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anyway"}
{"source": "PROS:  First and foremost the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for anything else with similar features, but keep in mind that it has durability issues so be gentle with it and it will last indefinitely"}
{"source": "  This isn't a Tech 21 NYC Bass Driver by any means, but works in a similar fashion to one"}
{"source": "  I have a Tech 21 Bass Driver Deluxe that I use at gigs"}
{"source": "  The Tech 21 sounds better but costs about eight times what the Behringer cost"}
{"source": "  I use the Behringer at home and save that wear on my pedal board at home"}
{"source": "  If I didn't have the Tech 21 unit I might take this unit to gigs, but it probably will last way longer the way I keep it setup at home all the time"}
{"source": "  I especially like this unit when used with small rehearsal/practice type combos"}
{"source": "  Many of these smaller combos have passive type tone circuits that basically are at flat when the tone is cranked wide open and this device really makes these little amps sound more serious"}
{"source": "  Part of the beauty of an active bass is the tone boost capability you don't get in a passive bass and if you have a passive bass this can make it sound more like an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amp"}
{"source": "  It is also useful for boosting a signal in front of a longer cable run to the backline, say anything over about 18 feet"}
{"source": "  For recording the XLR direct out is very useful and the XLR direct out can also be used to feed the PA at a gig if your amp doesn't have a XLR direct out"}
{"source": "How I use this device:  I have my bass guitar plugged into the input and use the XLR output to connect it to a microphone mixer"}
{"source": "  The output from microphone mixer is patched into a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz soundcard in an XP computer"}
{"source": " I can then record using the computer's recording software, practice solo or I can play along to recorded music using headphones"}
{"source": "  With headphones I can play as loud as I want anytime that I want without disturbing anyone"}
{"source": "  Most computer speakers are very inadequate for electric bass, so I recommend headphones instead of your typical desktop computer speakers"}
{"source": "  You can buy better computer speakers that are capable, but they will cost about the same or actually more than a decent bass guitar practice combo amp"}
{"source": "  Quality headphones cost far less than quality powered computer speakers that are bass guitar capable"}
{"source": "Having owned this pedal for about 4 years and knowing what I know about it, I would buy it again"}
{"source": "  I would strongly recommend it as a home recording/practice tool but my recommendation as a stage tool is not as strong"}
{"source": "  For home use it is fine"}
{"source": "  You can use it at gigs but I'd be saving up \"gig bones\" to buy something more durable with better performance"}
{"source": "It's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months"}
{"source": " Tried everything I could, but it's gone"}
{"source": " I would not recommend this pedal"}
{"source": "I own numerous Behringer products and have never had an issue with any of them"}
{"source": "This item is well worth the money and the sound is awsome, which is what you want"}
{"source": "  Who cares if it is plastic"}
{"source": "I own a Behringer X V-Amp Guitar Multi Effects Pedal and when I first plugged into it, the quality of the amp models blew me away"}
{"source": "To the guy who said he received one with stripped out screws and to not even think about stepping on the pedal"}
{"source": " Dude, it sounds like you were sent a returned product that someone messed with"}
{"source": "  You should have been bright enough to just return it and ask for a replacement"}
{"source": "  Second, these are musical instruments"}
{"source": "  You aren't supposed to stomp on them like you are trying to crush them and grind them into the stage"}
{"source": " or where ever you play"}
{"source": "  The term 'stomp' box isn't supposed to be taken literally"}
{"source": "  It simply means you push the pedal button with your foot"}
{"source": "  Erego, the word stomp"}
{"source": "What can you say"}
{"source": " at less than $30(incl shipping), it's a steal! I was looking for a VERY inexpensive version of the popular Sansamp, and this does it for me"}
{"source": "  Decent SVT, flip top or \"fat tube\" tone, and a nice quiet DI"}
{"source": "  I go DI to the house, and the output into my old Seymour Duncan amp/Aguilar GS410 cab"}
{"source": " Great tone!! I'm using a 9VDC Class II wall wart (found it in my \"spare parts\" closet) vs 9V batteries"}
{"source": "  With the wall wart, no DI hum = Great! Does eat batteries, so get yourself a power supply"}
{"source": " Never use the foot switch; if used at all, I use my finger"}
{"source": "  If broken or lost(who would steal it?), I'd buy another in a heart beat!"}
{"source": "I have a Line 6 Vetta II with a Floorboard that takes care of all my needs for effects (for gigs and in my studio) including a wah pedal but sometimes I take my smaller Marshall down below to jam with friends"}
{"source": " I just needed something low-priced that would do the job for me in that situation and I ended up with something a lot more when I bought this pedal"}
{"source": " I got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now"}
{"source": " I really like it and for the price, I don't see how you can beat it"}
{"source": " It seems well-made and I think, or I hope, it will hold up well with normal care"}
{"source": " I've only ever used my Line 6 Floorboard and before that, an old Crybaby for wah effects before but I'll tell you what I really like about this pedal"}
{"source": " It's spring-loaded so it comes back up by itself"}
{"source": " It says you can remove the spring too if you want but that feature combined with the fact that it turns on when you step on it and turns off when you step off of it, allows me to be much more creative in my playing and use of the wah"}
{"source": " I don't even have to think about whether it's on or off which is liberating and it allows me to use the wah in ways I never could before like on half a riff or certain parts of a passage"}
{"source": " I also like that you can really step on it without worrying about switching it off like other wahs"}
{"source": " The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there's some sort of semi-annoying hiccup in the sound sometimes"}
{"source": " It only seems to happen in the last part of the sweep when the pedal is coming up, so I can avoid it if I try"}
{"source": " I don't know if it's just mine or is something inherent in this pedal"}
{"source": " I'll update this review if I ever figure it out"}
{"source": "Its ok"}
{"source": "  It does what it says, but if youre using more than one other pedal you get a loud white noise in the background"}
{"source": "I got this in the mail today and plugged it into my pedal board just prior to the amp"}
{"source": " Like the other reviewers on here, I'm sad to report that it's quite 'hissy'"}
{"source": " I had hoped that it would not be a hissing type of pedal but it is"}
{"source": " I'm using a Line 6 Uber Metal, Boss Metal Zone, Ibanez LA Metal & Boss Compressor/Sustainer with my SKB pedal board"}
{"source": " The board itself is not noisy at all with any of the other pedal cranked up BUT when I put the EQ700 in with the others, there's a noticeable hiss though not so much at low volume but when you crank the amp (I'm using a Peavey Special 212 Transtube combo) above 4, you can definitely hear the hiss"}
{"source": " Not sure if a noise gate pedal would reduce this but I'm going to give the Danaelectro Fish & Chips (as recommended by another reviewer) a try"}
{"source": "I'm waiting on the Behringer Orchestra Chorus pedal to arrive and HOPING it isn't hissy like the EQ700 is"}
{"source": "I will say though I do like the tone influence this pedal has"}
{"source": " It does a nice job of altering the tone & gives my rig a greater flexibility for sounds"}
{"source": "Overall I give this pedal a 3 out of 5 stars"}
{"source": "It is a good pedal"}
{"source": " It is not heavy and the price is good"}
{"source": " It is a good choice for a beginner"}
{"source": " Thank you"}
{"source": "If you want an eq pedal right away to tweak guitar/keyboard sounds, this think is GREAT"}
{"source": " People are trying to hate on this, but it is fine, I was expecting the worst from the reviews, but still wanted it so I got it anyway"}
{"source": " You don't need the adapter they push (the behringer brand 9v), best way to work with this is turn all bands ALL THE WAY DOWN, then just go up with each one till you get the guitar sound you like, then you can turn it off during this test to go back to your \"default/normal sound\" to hear the difference"}
{"source": " It works nicely, and for the price it was a steal"}
{"source": " In the future I may get a more expensive one, this seems fine for now"}
{"source": "This pedal works well in my rig, I have two Boss EQ20's advanced EQ's and sometimes they are complicated due to the 10 bands they have, this little toy does the trick, and does it very well, I think that people who writes negative reviews don't know how to use it, it can require some time and experience but having much more expensive equipment to compare this pedal is a very good eq and for the price is unbeatable, highly recommended"}
{"source": " or you can go for the overpriced $100+ Boss original unit, at the end is the same, maybe a little quieter but essentially the same if you know what you are doing"}
{"source": "Whatever the name, this pedal is from the Ibanez Tube Screamer camp"}
{"source": " The packaging description says it uses the JRC4558 chip and MA150 diodes, and yes, Behringer got the sound right"}
{"source": " I'd say this competes well against any of the modded TS pedals"}
{"source": " What I love about this pedal is the TONE knob"}
{"source": " For the TS pedals in this price range, it's the most useful"}
{"source": " You can set it high, and it isn't too icepicky, yet the entire range is useful"}
{"source": " This is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound"}
{"source": "I prefer this pedal for boosting my gain in a hot amp or pedal, or another overdrive"}
{"source": " It works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones"}
{"source": " It could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones"}
{"source": "I bought this pedal to \"semi-retire\" an older Ibanez TS5 soundtank"}
{"source": " The switch on that one isn't as good as the Behringer's"}
{"source": " The Behringer has a much smoother action to it when turning the pedal on or off"}
{"source": " I use mainly solid state Fender amps, and several distortion pedals (including a BOSS Metal Zone)"}
{"source": " I'd bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt"}
{"source": " The only downside is the slight lack of bass"}
{"source": " If you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups (esp"}
{"source": " 2x12 and 4x12), or a distorted tone with plenty of bass, this shouldn't be a problem"}
{"source": "I had a BOSS Blues Driver pedal that I really liked, that is until I got this Behringer Tube Overdrive"}
{"source": " For blues, you (or at least I) want a gritty, dirty sound, one that implies some of the hurt implicit in blues music"}
{"source": " I was happy with the Boss, but I decided to try this B"}
{"source": " pedal, and I'm glad I did"}
{"source": " I compared them side-by-side, and the Tube Overdrive was much grittier, like a small tube amp pushed just past its clear sounding limit"}
{"source": " It's perfect for the sound I want, and I can adjust the amount of distortion to my preference"}
{"source": " Some like a LOT of that sound, but I prefer just enough to color the sound and shape it to my desires, leaving the rest to my playing and the dynamics of how I attack the strings"}
{"source": "I've now retired the Boss pedal"}
{"source": " In a careful comparison, the Boss had a cleaner and slightly more clear sound, which is not really an overdrive, but more of a distortion, but a clear distortion, if that makes any sense"}
{"source": " It does add sustain, but it can't compare with the B"}
{"source": " pedal's effect, which implies a power barely held in check, just exactly what I was after"}
{"source": "I own the old Ibanez TS9, that I modified to the original Keeley specs"}
{"source": " Side by side, there is a difference, but I only use it for my rehearsal rig"}
{"source": "  This is the first pedal, I've had to actually read the manual, in order to figure out how to install the battery!  The instructions tell you to use a ball point pen, to press in the hinge pins, in order to remove the foot switch cover!  I laugh when ever I hear about the &#34;Holy Grail&#34; 4558 IC Chip"}
{"source": "  When I modified my TS9, I found that Chip at Mouser, for 15 cents a piece!  It was a net order, and I felt weird ordering 1, so I ordered 5"}
{"source": " They send a 10 pound catalogue every month because of that purchase!!!  The Behringer TO 800 is a cheap alternative to the original if you're on a budget, and will do in a pinch"}
{"source": " The civilians won't notice the difference!"}
{"source": "I like the sound of this pedal"}
{"source": " It gives my ss Fender Princeton chorus a good tubelike sound"}
{"source": " I have 2 all tube amps but they are both heavy"}
{"source": " I prefer taking the fender ss on smaller gigs"}
{"source": " The TO800 gives me the sound I like without breaking the bank"}
{"source": " I haven't used batteries in it because I use a 1 spot adapter on all the pedals on my pedalboard"}
{"source": " If you'rethinking you want this and are on a tight budget go ahead and pull the trigger"}
{"source": " You won't be sorry"}
{"source": "this is a fun pedal and it really seems to work pretty good as far a getting tube like tones"}
{"source": " Simple"}
{"source": "For the money, this one's a no-brainer"}
{"source": "  It's a one-trick pony, but that's what it's supposed to be, and it does its trick very well"}
{"source": "  Sounds better than the Ibanez or Boss models - warmer and less processed-sounding"}
{"source": "  Plugged into a solid-state amp, at its lowest drive setting, it sounds like you're playing clean through a tube amp"}
{"source": "  Plugged into my '65 Twin Reverb (not a re-issue, but the real thing)- WOW!I just got it a couple of weeks ago, but it looks like it will hold up to gigging without a problem"}
{"source": " Don't be a 'gear snob' who looks down on lesser-expensive products - the sound is what matters"}
{"source": "This pedal is based on the famous Ibanez TS-808 pedal"}
{"source": " My hat's off to Behringer for doing an excellent job of recreating the classic sound in an affordable package"}
{"source": " I don't own the TS-808, but I do own a TS-9, and while the TS-9 does offer a nice gritty overdrive overdrive that has enough bite to bring your tone out in a mix, the TS800 offers a warmth and a sweetness that I've simply fallen in love with"}
{"source": " Several of the classic tubescreamer characteristics are audibly present: Slightly rolled off bass and a bit of a mid-range hump, with a tone control that offers useable tone at any setting"}
{"source": " I usually max out the level knob and adjust the drive know to taste(which never exceeds 12 o'clock); I've found that this setting gives my tone the most body and depth"}
{"source": " I use this pedal primarily with my Jet City JCA20H head just to \"pump\" it up a little bit"}
{"source": " This combination takes me straight into Guns 'n Roses (or that type of 80's/90's-era rock) territory"}
{"source": "Used over a clean tone the TS800 offers a very warm, smooth, bluesy overdrive that can either be more of a clean boost or add some grit depending on where you set the drive knob"}
{"source": "The pedal is made of plastic, and while it seems solid enough, it's the only area where this pedal really merits any criticism"}
{"source": " But considering that Behringer is offering this pedal for ["}
{"source": "], it's clear that in order for Behringer to offer such great tone at such a low price, sacrifices in build quality had to be made"}
{"source": " That being said, I don't feel concerned at all that this pedal will suddenly break on me; don't be too rough with it and it should last a good while"}
{"source": "This pedal, used in conjunctions with a host of others on my board ('The Labyrinth'), does what it claims to do and more"}
{"source": " It seriously boosts the instrument signal from my Tele at a mere 50% level setting and makes the subsequent MXR Distortion + pedal crackle with goodness and increased sustain"}
{"source": " I've purchased a host of Behringer guitar pedals during the last year (used, I might add) and am happy with every single one of them"}
{"source": " Don't let the cheap price fool ya"}
{"source": " I've been using all manner of guitar pedals in my work since the 1970's - yes, I'm \"old\" -  and these stack up against anything similar that more expensive manufacturers have to offer"}
{"source": " I'm just glad that I'm getting most of them for under $50 before the world figures out how reliable they are and Behringer jacks the price of everything"}
{"source": " Oh yes, I use a OneSpot 9v multi-adapter to power everything, so I cannot comment on how quickly these pedals plow through batteries"}
{"source": " GOOD STUFF!"}
{"source": "Every guitarist needs a volume pedal at some point in a gig"}
{"source": " THe Behringer Preamplifier/Volume booster pedal is an inexpensive yet quality volume pedal that works great!"}
{"source": "I got this several years ago, and I was pleasantly surprised by it, really was nice with my acoustic to raise some volume on my soundhole pickup before the direct box"}
{"source": " I gave it to some one after I used it for a couple of years"}
{"source": "This pedal does exactly what it says it's supposed to"}
{"source": " It boosts the guitars signal"}
{"source": " It does it really well, with very little to no noise"}
{"source": " The thing I like most is that it is not a \"sledge hammer\" type pedal or overdrive"}
{"source": " The input signal is cleanly boosted"}
{"source": " What you put into the input comes out the same only louder"}
{"source": " It starts with no change in the signal and allows you to raise up the gain very slowly"}
{"source": " It just gives the signal from your guitar a stronger output to whatever you are plugging into (amp, mixer, effects or pedal board)"}
{"source": " This pedal arrived at my door on a Friday afternoon so I took it to a gig that night without trying it first (something I don't normally do)"}
{"source": " The first two times I used this pedal were that night (Friday) and the next (Saturday)"}
{"source": " I thought it worked great for my needs"}
{"source": " A few days later I read a review that said this pedal had a noticable hiss"}
{"source": " Since I didn't remember hearing any, I got it out at home and plugged it into my amp (I have the same amp at home that I use live)"}
{"source": " When you activate it with the tone set flat on the pedal and the volume about 12:00, there is a very sight hiss (no noise when bypassed)"}
{"source": " For me it is a very minor hiss that in live situations with all the normal room noises I never heard at all"}
{"source": " This may not be true for all amps and maybe some high gain input amps may handle this signal differently"}
{"source": " I know for sure it is a lot quieter than almost any effects pedal I have ever owned and I have box full from 35 years of playing"}
{"source": " I am using a Vox VT30 which is a modeling amp with lots of bulit in effects (delays, chorus, flanger, compressors etc"}
{"source": ") These days I don't use any additional outboard effects (except a BBA Sonic Stomp that I never turn off) so siganl from my guitar hits my amps input very cleanly"}
{"source": " If you use various guitars on gigs, this pedal is very useful"}
{"source": " It allows me to quickly match the various guitar output levels and compensate for differences between humbuckers, single coils and piezo pick ups on an acoustic without having to adjust the amp controls"}
{"source": " This is a great problem solver for any rig that needs to control the input level to the amp and it does it at a bare bones price"}
{"source": "I have owned several Behringer pedals for live work and have some Behringer rack gear in my live audio rack and in my home studio"}
{"source": " I gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully"}
{"source": " I have never broken or had a problem with any of my Behrinnger gear (including a pair of Behringer 12\" powered speakers mixed with a pair of Mackie 15\" powered mains)"}
{"source": " I don't intentionally abuse my gear but at 2:00 when your packing up s*** happens but so far my Behringer stuff has never let me down yet and I have had some it for many years"}
{"source": " I also keep reading about people worrying about the hard plastic cases on Behringer pedals"}
{"source": " Don't worry about it"}
{"source": " They are sturdy enough"}
{"source": " (Just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage"}
{"source": " The battery goes under the pedal switch and the spring that is under the foot switch will probbaly fall out if you are not careful"}
{"source": " (To open the battery compartment/foot switch cover just use a pen or small phillips style jewelers screwdriver and push in the black pins on either side of the pedal"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "I purchased a budget passive soundhole pickup for a guitar I bring to a local open mic"}
{"source": "To get any volume from it the sound guy had to boost the channel very high and the sound was still a bit thin"}
{"source": "  I found the Behringer PB100 and after reviewing various posts about it as well as checking out the YouTube demos of the device I purchased it"}
{"source": "  I used it for the past four weeks at the open mic and have been impressed with how it boosts the sound without effort"}
{"source": "  I can add a bit of bass which makes the guitar finally sound as it should too"}
{"source": "  This pedal makes the budget pickup sound like a much more expensive pickup now"}
{"source": "like title says"}
{"source": " the item does what it's supposed to"}
{"source": "  you get the headroom you expect from a 20 dollar item"}
{"source": "  I love the ability to have separate control over both inputs"}
{"source": "  I've had it for a few months and I'm experiencing some noise on the pots, which I didn't expect"}
{"source": "  I thought it would've lasted a little longer"}
{"source": " I can open it and clean the pots but again, I expected a little more life out of it"}
{"source": "  battery operation would've been nice but like I said, does what it is supposed to, well enough that I've bought 2 of them"}
{"source": "Was a great problem solver for me but almost exactly one year after getting it the volume died"}
{"source": " Useless now"}
{"source": " I used the \"line\" input (to tap into an aux feed that got recorded) as it came off a live board"}
{"source": " For the price I guess I shouldn't complain too much"}
{"source": " Behringer often means trading price for longevity as the QC seems to be very hit and miss"}
{"source": " So now time to decide; do I resign myself to replace it every year or get something mo betta?Note: this is a low end, but still \"pro audio,\" piece of a equipment"}
{"source": " And while it truley doesn't get super loud, for people who say it barely does anything volume wise I have to wonder if they are using it with home audio equipment? If so, your signal strength going into the unit is likely well below the +4dBu \"line level\" signal that pro gear offers"}
{"source": " Subsequently you are boosting a signal that is much lower to begin with"}
{"source": " And as a result are getting poor volume plus the added \"bonus\" of increased distorion and/or floor noise when you do try and crank it up"}
{"source": "Update: well it works some days and not others it seems- so a I keep it around for now as I am having more good days than bad days with it lately"}
{"source": " Can't really see a rhyme of reason to it- connections don't seem loose or intermitant or anything like that- I just either have good volume or it craps out??? It is in one permanent location, used exacty the same way every time- so it's never a matter of a different configuration or using it with different gear"}
{"source": "Love this amp"}
{"source": "  My Drummer is stoked to be able to use this product and has really enhance our music"}
{"source": "  Affordable and great quality"}
{"source": "This gadget has stereo in for your monitor mix & a passthrough for you mic so you can get the overall mix set then add in your mic to get the \"more me\" setting"}

{"source": " Works great"}
{"source": "This is an awesome way to get into the in ear monitor game without dropping hundreds of dollars"}
{"source": " Adjust your volume of the main mix, and adjust your instrument/mic level relative to the mix without affecting the main sound or your band mates feeds"}
{"source": " Perfect for that singer or musician who is constantly asking for &#34;more me&#34; in their monitor"}
{"source": " You can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want"}
{"source": "This is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast, especially if you are using any of the XENYX or other Behringer brand mixers (it also works with other mixers as well)"}
{"source": "This is a great, inexpensive, way to  get your analog audio into your digital recording software"}

{"source": "  It works and it's by far and away the best cheap option to go when you want to record audio to your computer"}
{"source": "I use it with Audacity"}
{"source": "  At first, I found the recordings to be rather noisy with lots of hiss"}
{"source": "  After fooling around for a couple hours trying to figure it out, I thought it was just because the audio interface was a cheap product"}
{"source": "  The next day, I fooled around with it more and realized I needed to turn the mic input down (in Audacity) and turn up the gain halfway on my mixer"}
{"source": "  When I did this, it completely shut out the hiss"}
{"source": "  I've been making great recordings since"}
{"source": "It's a plug and play tool, but it should come with some kind of instructions for problems like I experienced"}
{"source": "  However, they are just a matter of setting up your computer properly because this thing works very well"}
{"source": "For those wondering about latency, obviously there's some"}
{"source": "  You'll get latency with any type of recording device"}
{"source": "  You just have to account for it in the settings of your audio editing program"}
{"source": "The only other thing that is a legit complaint is that playback is a bit noisy and hissy in the headphones if you have the headphones turned up high"}
{"source": "  It does not sound like that in the recordings, though"}
{"source": "  So, it's OK"}
{"source": "  I can deal with itThis is a very good product and can't be beat for the price"}
{"source": "  When it comes to quality, you have to set it up correctly"}
{"source": "  When you do set it up properly, the quality is fantastic"}
{"source": "  It would be nice if there was some kind of troubleshooting guide that came with it, though"}
{"source": "This unit works great for taking a line level from something like an audio mixer or even an old cassette deck and converting it into a USB audio input"}
{"source": " I have not used the headphone monitoring section (doubt I ever would) so I cannot comment on that feature, but this unit is so simple to use that I was pleasantly surprised"}
{"source": "For anyone in a band out there - I used this device to take a line out from our PA system into an old laptop running (free) Audacity software and was blown away by the quality of the recording"}
{"source": " This even helped us to figure out better vocal balance technique for some parts that were not quite perfect on stage"}
{"source": "This little device is more than worth the money"}
{"source": "  I run a Behringer EUROPOWER PMP1280S Powered Mixer into the Behringer 1202 12 channel desktop mixer($80)into the UCA202 into my computer"}
{"source": "  The recording is awesome"}
{"source": "  My recording playback sounds like its live"}
{"source": "I use a lot of Behringer equipment and no, I don't work for Behringer"}
{"source": "  I'm on a budget"}
{"source": "  That means little money"}
{"source": "My friends say, \"Duh, oh, well, Behringer is built cheap and is junk"}
{"source": "\"  And I say, \"Duh, huh, really?  I've got better sound than you, a lot more equipment to power my show, it has never broken down, and I paid a LOT less than you did"}
{"source": "\"In fact, I use Behringer XM8500 mics ( 3 pack for $60 )"}

{"source": "  I said sure"}
{"source": "  When he was done, he said, I LOVE this mic"}
{"source": "  The sound is awesome"}
{"source": "  Nuff said"}
{"source": "I'm reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my Behringer 802 Xenyx mixer, and I finally did after nearly throwing in the towel"}
{"source": "  Turns out I was using my mixer's CD/Tape switch incorrectly, thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback"}
{"source": "  I finally went on You Tube and found a Behringer guy that has a video that's less than 2 minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer"}
{"source": "  Just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple I was doing wrong - I was over-thinking it"}
{"source": " Once I got it to working correctly, I could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly, including the control on my PC that controlled the recording volume for this unit"}
{"source": "  So, now I'm looking forward to doing some real recording with it, using Audacity as my main recording software"}
{"source": " (Edit: I did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really, really pleased with the results - I can hardly wait to do some more recording with this"}
{"source": " So, to the arrogant salesman who bad-mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a $150"}
{"source": "00 Lexicon unit, I won't be needing that - I'm quite happy with this little interface, thank you very much"}
{"source": " And to everyone else, don't forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your PC and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on-board sound card"}
{"source": "  Thanks Behringer, this is a great value!!"}
{"source": "I own two of these Behringer boxes (they come in two modals) and use them with Sonor/cakewalk and an internal software sound modual (Roland Virtual sound Canvas) to play back midi files with my live two piece band"}
{"source": " The sound through the PA (Soundcraft mixer and Mackie active speakers) is loud and very clear, in most cases, no eq needed"}
{"source": " I guess it really revolves around your personal needs"}
{"source": " For live performance these Behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal"}
{"source": " I do not use it to record as my home recording is done on a stand alone DAW (Tascam 2488 24 track)"}

{"source": "Let me begin with a Public Service Announcement: If you want to buy other EZDrummer expansion packs, YOU NEED TO BUY THIS PRODUCT FIRST!***IMPORTANT UPDATE*** Toontrack is scheduling the public release of EZ Drummer 2"}
{"source": "0 in May 2014"}
{"source": " If you buy EZ Drummer 1"}
{"source": "0 from now until then, you will ALSO get the download for 2"}
{"source": "0"}
{"source": " Bear in mind, EZD2 is a completely new/different program from EZD1, and so I would jump on this opportunity considering you get the stock EZD1 Pop/Rock Kit (which has some very kit pieces) in addition to the EZD2 default kit (which is more reminiscent of the ROCK! expansion kit from what I've seen)"}
{"source": " EZ Drummer 2"}
{"source": "0 also gives you the ability to mix/mash kit pieces from all expansions, and so to me this makes EZ Drummer a MUST BUY based on the sheer customization available"}
{"source": " ***RESUME NORMAL PROGRAMMING***If you are an amateur musician and you want a quality virtual drum kit, EZDrummer is probably the best bang for the buck you'll find"}
{"source": " It's very easy to use, very easy to program, and overall a well made product"}
{"source": " You might be tempted to compare EZDrummer to its bigger and better brother: Superior Drummer 2"}
{"source": "0, made by the same company"}
{"source": " Superior Drummer is superior to EZDrummer, but is a little more tedious and more suitable for musicians who want an exact close-to-life sounding virtual instrument"}
{"source": "There are ways to improve the off-the-shelf sound quality of EZDrummer immediately"}
{"source": " YouTube has plenty of video tutorials on this, but what you want to do is open up your Digital Audio Workstation (Pro Tools, Cubase, etc), and set EZDrummer for multi-track output"}
{"source": " From there you'll be able to tweak the different outputs EZDrummer has as if you were in a studio and had 7 mics at your disposal"}
{"source": " Most high-end professional studios use about 10 mics to capture everything on a drum kit, and so 7 virtual mics is nothing to scoff at: Kick Drum, Snare Top and Bottom, Toms, Cymbals, Overhead, and Room"}
{"source": " Once you have each of those outputs running, you can perform individual EQs to change the tone dramatically"}
{"source": " Adding a touch of distortion/gain and room reverb will make the stock kit sound REALLY close-to-life"}
{"source": " In reality, once you have additional instruments layered and everything mixed and balanced, it only takes a trained ear to tell that it's a virtual kit"}
{"source": "As far as the expansions go, if you are looking to record a particular style of music, then I highly recommend buying the EZX kit that goes with that genre"}
{"source": " The stock Rock kit is VERY GOOD (after performing the mods above)"}
{"source": " but only for Rock"}
{"source": " As for me personally, I did my best to EQ and tweak the crap out of it to get a nice metal tone, but in the end, I found the Rock kit lacking, especially since it's a \"tight\" kit (3 toms, 3 cymbals, 1 hi-hat, 1 snare, 1 kick)"}
{"source": "I write and record my own music"}
{"source": "  I stink at writing drums"}
{"source": "  I don't play drums, I don't really have room for a drumset, and I really don't want to spend the money on a drumset to see if I can figure it out"}
{"source": "  This is a great program for non-drumming, one man bands like me"}
{"source": "  MIDI drums and the drum sounds from my Yamaha keyboard just wasn't cutting it"}
{"source": "  It works with Ableton Live 9 with no problems"}
{"source": "  Tons of different grooves"}

{"source": "  Very easy to use"}
{"source": "The software itself (sound/interface): 4"}
{"source": "5 starsThe installation and activation: 2 starsPROS:1) The drums included in EZ Drummer are the most realistic \"computer drums\" I have ever heard"}
{"source": " I'm using them on my latest song and have gotten nothing but compliments on how they sound"}
{"source": "2) All sounds are MIDI, which means you can manipulate how you see fit"}
{"source": " I use EZ Drummer with MixCraft and have modified pretty much every beat I have used so far with the built-in MIDI editing capabilities"}
{"source": "3) The interface is clean an easy to use"}
{"source": " You just drag a beat from the EZ Drummer window into your DAW"}
{"source": "CONS:When I was reading reviews I just thought the people complaining about the install/activation were being wusses"}
{"source": " I mean seriously, how hard can it be? Well, they were right, it sucks"}
{"source": " It took me two hours to get it all working"}
{"source": "My advice: Don't even install the app from the included disc"}

{"source": "There's plenty of specs/details/videos on the interwebs about this software, go do some research, see if you like it"}
{"source": " It's way better than the drum kits that come with Garageband and there's plenty of kits to expand with"}
{"source": " I got the Vintage Rock kit and I love it - almost as much as I love pizza, which I will marry some day"}
{"source": " I like a cheese pizza"}
{"source": " Some call it \"plain\" but with the right blend of sauce, cheese and crust, there's nothing plain about it - it's somewhat complex, much like myself"}
{"source": " We are a perfect match, pizza and me"}
{"source": " We go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom"}
{"source": " I'm not exclusively a thin crust guy, sometimes I dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish"}
{"source": "The only weak point in this pizza I mean software is that you can't do a cymbal swell"}
{"source": " Apparently, it's the same with all these virtual kits, regardless of brand, but it would be nice if someone (toontrack) would address it by including a \"side stick\" attack on the crashes"}
{"source": " If you try to do a cymbal swell, you hear the initial stick-on-cymbal \"ting\" with each attack, so it's kind of a \"ting-ting-ting-ting\" sound instead of \"bwooooosssshhhhh"}
{"source": "\" I'm sure I can find a bwoosh loop without a ting-ting"}
{"source": " Bwoosh loop - no ting-ting"}
{"source": " Do I get a fortune cookie with that?Pizza time!Ohhh, myyyy loooove"}
{"source": " my darlin'"}
{"source": " I hun-ger for"}
{"source": " your crust"}
{"source": "I could go on and on for days, but the best things about EZD are the endless EZX packs you can add in and the fact that all drum grooves have a mic on each drum as well as room and overhead mics which give you that live, organic sound that you can never get with loops"}
{"source": "You can edit the grooves and fills via MIDI if you need too, add in cymbals, etc"}
{"source": " It's really, really an amazing program"}
{"source": " Best money I ever spent!"}
{"source": "I have a solid non weight relief Les Paul Traditional that is one heavy motha and these locks keep my fat girl nice and close to me"}
{"source": " Like these better then the bulkier Dunlops"}
{"source": "This is a great way to easily add or remove a strap to your guitar"}
{"source": " If you don't enjoy dealing with a strap getting in the way when sitting and playing but don't like putting a strap on and off or if you just want more peace of mind that your guitar won't slip out of the strap while you're playing then upgrade to this system!"}
{"source": "Besides looking cool they are for sure not going to malfunction, you have to pull up on the tab to get the strap to release"}
{"source": " they spin nice"}
{"source": " Good locks, I like them better then the dunlops"}
{"source": "When I first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune"}
{"source": " Mainly the second to the last string at the bottom and I later learned it was the wrong tuner and the string tree was too blame"}
{"source": " Sometimes I just don't pay attention to the obvious;)It turned out that there are 3 short tuners and 3 long ones"}
{"source": " The long ones go on the top 3 strings, the short ones the bottom 3 strings, get that because I had them on incorrectly"}
{"source": " And even worse, I was using the string tree which is the part that holds down the 2 bottom strings"}
{"source": " The string tree(google guitar string tree and you'll see one) was actually making the strings not stay in tune with the locking tuners"}
{"source": " I know silly but I was not paying attention"}
{"source": "The reason you use the short tuners for the bottom is so the guitar will stay in tune! The string trees get in the way and when you whammy the strings go out of tune"}
{"source": " Please take a note of that"}
{"source": "Overall a good product"}
{"source": "i got two sets of these tunners, my jackson and fender guitars stay way better in tune now, i love them"}
{"source": "These locking tuners are perfect for any Strat or Tele"}
{"source": " I have an American Strat and an American Tele that both came with fairly decent non-locking tuners"}
{"source": " I also have a Carvin and two Paul Reed Smith guitars that came with locking tuners"}
{"source": "they are certainly worth having"}
{"source": " Fenders (at least American-made ones) are very easy to swap out tuners for these"}
{"source": "the holes are already there, there's no need to drill holes for screws, everything is so easy you have to do it yourself"}
{"source": " I've swapped out the tuners and have never looked back"}
{"source": "the only question is what to do with the non-locking Fender tuners I have now!"}
{"source": "I ordered these tuners for my Fender Blacktop Stratocaster (MIM)"}
{"source": " I just received these tuning machines today "}
{"source": " the pegs line up, so they drop right in"}
{"source": " Remember "}
{"source": " the E-A-D are that tall capstans and the G-B-E are the shorter capstans "}
{"source": " it all works out"}
{"source": " I've also put 5 springs in the block (I like stiff tremelo, bridge flush to surface) and replaced the amplifier knobs with conventional Strat knobs (had to get CTS split-shaft 500K pots for that and replace the solid shaft pots)"}
{"source": " The amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar"}
{"source": " BUT, back to the tuners "}
{"source": " they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning"}
{"source": " Much easier and faster to change strings"}
{"source": "I just ordered another set for my Strat H-S-S "}
{"source": " great guitar but could certainly use these tuners"}
{"source": "This tunners turned my normal cheap Squier, into a perfect Squier"}
{"source": " My guitar now stays in tune better than my PRS and Epiphone"}
{"source": "Excellent product at a righteous price"}
{"source": " Helps my guitar stay in tune"}
{"source": "Changed the saddles at the same time and the sustain is much better"}
{"source": "SUMMARYIf you aren't using locking tuners, you're wasting time when you restring"}
{"source": " They are just faster and easier"}
{"source": " Overall, this is a really nice convenience upgrade on guitars and it's not very expensive to do"}
{"source": " Fender uses these on the American Deluxe, and once I got one, I had to have these on the rest of my stratocasters"}
{"source": " Because they save time restringing, you are more inclined to restring frequently, which means you sound better"}
{"source": " (Fresh strings can do a lot for your sound!)I've put these on several guitars I have, and always appreciate them when changing strings"}
{"source": " At instalation be aware these are staggered height tuners so be sure to put them in the correct holes (see below)"}
{"source": " These are drop in replacement tuners for most modern MIA and MIM Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters that use a Shaller style tuner"}
{"source": " Fender makes these relatively cheap now in chrome, although I wish they would make them affordable and available in a gold finish"}
{"source": " I've seen also seen nickel and black, and they make gold but hard to find and rather expensive (something like $120 a set)"}
{"source": "FUNCTION/PURPOSEI think people believe these somehow give you more stable tuning or something but that is actually not their purpose"}
{"source": " Proper use of a traditional non-locking tuner is just as stable"}
{"source": " Some folks don't actually understand how to properly use traditional tuners and they don't get stable tuning as a result because they use too few or too many wraps and don't string it correctly"}
{"source": " For those folks, these will elimiate the resulting \"pings\" and such"}
{"source": " But their intended purpose is to speed string changes"}
{"source": " I believe that some folks confuse locking tuners with a locking nut in that respect"}
{"source": " A locking nut quite definitely makes for more stable tuning, and that's why you always find them with Floyd Rose tremolos which are made for dive bombing"}
{"source": " But locking tuners are not really for that purpose"}
{"source": "FIT AND INSTALLATIONRegarding fit, these have 2 little pins on the backside"}
{"source": " If you are considering a replacement, make sure you get tuners that are the right size and configuration for your guitar so you don't have to drill the back of the neck, the tuner bores in the headstock, or use inserts"}
{"source": " If you want to use these but don't have the little alignment holes, Stewart Macdonald makes a small drilling jig for drilling those holes"}
{"source": " It's expensive (about $40) but not as expensive as messing up your neck or breaking the tuners when you tighten them down on ill fitting mounts"}
{"source": " It is nearly impossible to drill those alignment pin holes correctly without a jig, and even with the jig, easy to be slightly off"}
{"source": " These fit most newer FENDER stratocasters and tele's, both american and MIM and will be a drop in replacement with no muss and no fuss in most of those cases"}
{"source": "Pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change"}
{"source": " If you have a squier or a knockoff you may want to measure the headstock bore and remove a tuner to look at the back mount"}
{"source": " Maybe buy and inspect, with the knowledge you might have to return them"}
{"source": " There is usually an exact fit drop in replacement locking tuner that can replace your standard tuner so if this isn't it, look for one in the same brand as what is on your guitar now"}
{"source": " Be aware different tuners also have slightly different holes bored for the main peg hole"}
{"source": "Typical neck bores for tuners (by brand) are shown on the warmoth site at ["}
{"source": "]These are the holes that warmoth uses on custom necks when fitting tuners of various brands:- For Fender/Shaller tuners, its a two step bore, with the main portion being 25/64\" and the rest at 11/32\""}
{"source": "- Vintage style tuners use 11/32\"- Gotoh and Grover use a two step 13/32\" to 11/32\"- Sperzel uses 25/64\"- Planet waves uses 13/32\"Of course, if you are mechnically inclined, have the tools, and don't mind potentially drilling additional holes in your neck, you can almost fit any tuner you want on any guitar"}
{"source": " Sometimes that means using inserts or bushings, or drilling a hole for a tiny backmount screw, or for alignment pins in different locations"}
{"source": "but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a drop-in replacement"}
{"source": "When installing, be sure to look at the height of the pegs on your old and these new tuners"}
{"source": " These are not all the same length -- they have staggered heights - 3 long and 3 shorter"}
{"source": " (I think I have also seen some sets that are 4/2 but these are 3/3"}
{"source": ") Put the long ones in the E-A-D string holes, and the shorter ones in the G-B-HighE holes"}
{"source": "These replaced the stock tuners on my Squier Deluxe Stratocaster and were NOT a drop in fit"}
{"source": " There are two pegs on the tuners that didn't line up with the holes from my stock tuners in the headstock and required me to drill additional holes"}
{"source": " I was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away"}
{"source": "These make string changes so easy and I love the ratio of these tuners"}
{"source": " Because they are staggered I was able to ditch the string trees as well"}
{"source": "Unfortunately, these tuners require drilling to fit my Squier Strat"}
{"source": "They look very similar but the two pins are approximately 1/16th of an inch further out from the shaft so I'm going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them"}
{"source": " Worse, the holes will actually touch the edge of the existing stock holes so, I'm going to have to fill them, first"}
{"source": "The quality of the locking tuners looks great!I only wish that they'd show a diagram with the specs written on it so that I could have known that these don't fit my guitar!"}
{"source": "Now all I have to do is install these on my Burswood Strat Copy"}
{"source": " I know I'm gonna have to drill holes for the locating pins I may even have to drill the tuner holes also"}
{"source": " Look forward to getting those crappy, loose, un-smooth, original hardware tuners off this thing"}
{"source": "July 20, 2012:Just installed these Fender locking tuners on my Strat"}
{"source": " Didn't have to drill the tuner holes, they were the perfect size"}
{"source": " Placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole (with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them) and  very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points"}
{"source": " Then with a small magnifying glass and using a punch I made a center punch mark (just using pressure by hand with the punch since wood is soft) on each indent that the tuner made"}
{"source": " Set my drill depth with a piece of tape on the drill and was done in less than 15 minutes"}
{"source": "We use these at our church to light up stands for performing music or doing readings during worship"}
{"source": "I appreciate the adjustable antennae so that the lights can be directed to specific areas"}
{"source": " The light is bright enough to be able to read even if the room is otherwise in darkness"}
{"source": " I do wish they had one more LED in the heads, though - with two standard 8-1/2 x 11 pages on the music stand, the outer edges cannot be lit directly (though there is enough bleed over light to see it, it's not as bright as it could be)"}
{"source": " Just another 20% output would make these 5 stars perfect"}
{"source": "Construction-wise, they're slightly fragile - clearly not made for industrial or heavy duty use - but for standard usage, they will hold up just fine and should last for years"}
{"source": "We love them - we have 7 or 8 at the church that we use"}
{"source": " They're especially wonderful because they're battery operated"}
{"source": " With all the cords we already have from microphones, it's wonderful not to have an equal number of extra power cords running a bunch of electric lights"}
{"source": " There's an extra environmental cost with using the batteries versus plugging them in, but the handiness, adaptability, and lack of extra cords make it worth it"}
{"source": "Definitely recommend these to anyone, and also recommend the manufacturer add another 20% or so lumens"}
{"source": "These are great lights for music stands"}
{"source": "  If you need a good blackout light theMighty Bright 52010 Pedalboard Light, Blackhas a red light that works great for dark stages"}
{"source": "  Because they are LED the batteries last a long time"}
{"source": " Some of the Mighty Bright lights also have an AC adapter option but this one doesn't"}
{"source": "This clamp on pair of miniature lamps does an excellent job of illuminating music, set lists and notes"}
{"source": " The manufacturer claims 12 lumens of light, which is roughly equivalent to a 1 Watt bulb, but the lens and the way the light is diffused make them seem much brighter"}
{"source": " Since the design keeps the light somewhat directional they are relatively discreet and will not interfere with others on the stage, in the studio or in the audience"}
{"source": "The three batteries will last 28 hours of continuous use according to the spec sheet, and that is in the ballpark of the use time I am getting between battery changes"}
{"source": "What I love is the dual heads, each on a gooseneck that is over a foot long"}
{"source": " The length gives you a lot of flexibility [no pun intended] for placing the lights exactly where you want them"}
{"source": " The goosenecks easily bend and stay in whatever position you bend them to"}
{"source": " The clamp is perfect for most stands and has a layer of padding to prevent marring surfaces"}
{"source": " The manufacturer claims that this light can be used free standing"}
{"source": " Frankly that is a stretch and I would recommend a light designed with a larger base if that is what you are really looking for"}
{"source": " This one does work beautifully clamped to music stands, and the illumination will cover both pages of a chart"}
{"source": "My wife got this for me as I tend to play the guitar in less than ideal lighting conditions"}
{"source": "  THis is the neatest little light I have ever seen"}
{"source": "  It takes 3 AAA batteries (included- but I did not find them until I was tossing the package out)"}
{"source": " And has 2 nice LEDs"}
{"source": "  The lights are bright enough for my 40 something eyes but not so bright as to introduce glare on the sheep music"}
{"source": "  The clip is plenty strong enough and even hold to my rolled edge music stand"}
{"source": "  Battery life so far has been at least 8 hours (actually probably 12 hours as my daughter has been using the light also)"}
{"source": "  I love the ease at which the lights are adjustable"}
{"source": "  A real needed item is you play in darker rooms"}
{"source": "The Behringer ACX-450 is a good looking, great sounding amp in a small package, but should be used at low to medium volume"}
{"source": "  At higher volumes one has to take care with the equalizer to reduce bass and midrange, and also use the anti-feedback button, to avoid a \"muddy\" sound from too much (distorted?) bass"}
{"source": "  This not an amp to play loudly, but rather for low-to-mid volume accompaniment in a smaller venue"}
{"source": "As to the sound effects, it is great with 16 effects covering reverb, chorus, delay/echo and many combinations"}
{"source": "  I especially like that you can have all the effects with totally different settings on either channel"}
{"source": "  Also nice to have a separate XLR microphone input on channel 2"}
{"source": "The CD/MP3 input is good for backgrounds (or maybe drum machine) when playing, or music during breaks, although one needs a cable with RCA plugs to connect it"}
{"source": "  Lack of a headphone jack is a drawback, but is balanced by all the good things this little amp offers"}
{"source": "Overall, a great sounding and very flexible amp for a low price, if you don't plan to crank it up too much!"}
{"source": "I have been using the Behringer ACX450 for six months now"}
{"source": "  I was impressed early, and still am very satisfied with the performance"}
{"source": "  It is a straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp with some modest effects"}
{"source": "  One would have to be filling a large venue to need more than this quality amp can provide"}
{"source": "  I'm running preamps from Gibson J45 and a Taylor 114 ce and they both sound amazing and I don't even know what to do with the rest of the gain"}
{"source": "  The music from these instruments is clear, bright, deep and the sound is a great reproduction of the instruments themselves"}
{"source": "  Behringer's mission statement is to provide quality amplification to musicians at a reasonable price"}
{"source": "  I say, \"mission accomplished\""}
{"source": "  Amazon was seamless to work with and with free fast shipping the whole experience has been great"}
{"source": " Man, how did we get by before things were so cool and easy"}
{"source": "  Push a couple of buttons and magic appears at your doorstep"}
{"source": "Great amp but the instructions are minimal and pretty worthless"}
{"source": "  Unless you have a mixer, you can only use one instrument and one microphone with this"}
{"source": "  Really puts out the sound though, and I guess that's what you get an amp for!  I used it in a basketball gym and only had to turn the gain up to 2-3 to fill the place"}
{"source": "  Very nice effects on both channels"}
{"source": "I am so happy with this amp"}
{"source": " I've had it for close to a year now and it sounds amazing"}
{"source": " On a couple of occasions, I have plugged in my acoustic, my mic, and my buddies mic, and it still handled the load and sounded good"}
{"source": " I'm impressed"}
{"source": " I even have a Digitech pedal that I use with my Fender Strat, and it sounds amazing"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this amp"}
{"source": "This amp sounds great, looks great, works great and is a breath of fresh air from &#34;modelling&#34; amps or ones with many effects that require regular use of a manual to cycle through"}
{"source": " This Behringer has a dial offering four effects styles with five &#34;flavor&#34; settings in each"}
{"source": " They are all on one dial and there is no pushing, pullling or holding for seconds for lights to tell you you've switched gears"}
{"source": " Here you just turn the dial one little click at a time to find a sound out of the twenty"}
{"source": " There is a simple level knob for the intensity of the effect and the great thing is that a foot switch is included where you just stomp on a button to invoke your effects or return to clean acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " The foot switch has a second button for the other channel which can accommodate another guitar, microphone for singing, drum machine"}
{"source": " The EQ sliders are quality and give you a nice reference from a distance whereas if the were knobs you'd have to be right up on them to see how they are set"}
{"source": " I've had no problem with the front cover as a few others have mentioned--it's velcroed on there just fine"}
{"source": " The cabinet is covered in a nice brown leather-like material"}
{"source": " Plenty loud"}
{"source": "When I sit down to practice my guitar, I just want something very simple to keep time"}
{"source": " It was a pain previously to have to mess with menus and such on a computer to bring up a metronome app from tablet, phone or computer"}
{"source": " With this, I'll just have to flip a switch and dial the tempo that I want"}
{"source": " Simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines"}
{"source": " I do recommend this one"}
{"source": "I bought the Mini Tone Master as a practice amp for my Dean EVO electric guitar, and love it -- but there are a few things you should know before a possible purchase:1"}
{"source": " When they say \"mini,\" they mean it"}
{"source": " It's a tiny little thing about the size of a hardcover book (or smaller), and about as thick (2\" thick or so)"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " It also runs off a 9V battery, though if you have a DC9V adapter, there's a plug for it"}
{"source": " it also has a 1/4 jack for standard headphones or earbuds as well"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " It's LOUD"}
{"source": " Even when at low volume its tones will fill a room"}
{"source": " This is a major plus for such a tiny, inexpensive amp"}
{"source": "Controls on the amp are great; it has a gain/distortion knob that is almost as good as having an overdrive or gain effects pedal hooked up to a full-size amp"}
{"source": " It's strong enough to where if you're playing small gigs such as coffeehouses or hole-in-the wall small bars, you won't need to lug along your 10W (or larger) amp with you, though that may depend on the tone your guitar puts out to begin with"}
{"source": " Still, this is an awesome deal; I paid about $30 here on Amazon for it, so if you need a practice amp but don't want to spend a ton of cash, snatch up one of these little bad boys"}
{"source": " You won't be sorry"}
{"source": "I expected this to come with a DC adapter"}
{"source": " Nowhere is it mentioned there wouldn't be any or I could have ordered one"}
{"source": " The product is good, surprisingly loud"}
{"source": " The bass is too much for the body and the battery cover sort of rattles (once the battery popped out by itself when I played a low E) but that's no issue"}
{"source": " I have only used it with a 9V battery so far and noticed a continuous noise on a high gain"}
{"source": " I hope that doesn't happen with an adapter"}
{"source": " It's a nice little amp, good for carrying around"}
{"source": " If you have long fingers, you can sort of hold it between your outstretched thumb and middle finger along it's height - it's that small! A guitar strap, a backpack and a 5ft cable and you could easily walk around the house playing it"}
{"source": " The distortion it gives is good"}
{"source": " Not good for palm muting"}
{"source": " This is nice for practising Randy Rhoads, The Doors -type of rock where not many effects are used"}
{"source": "Also remember the DC adapter has a polarity outer ring + and inner -"}
{"source": " Many adapters come with the reverse of this polarity so make sure you check that before plugging in one"}
{"source": " It's easy to change the polarity, open the box of the adapter and exchange (needs soldering, obv) the red and the black wire places!"}
{"source": "soi f you want to turn Distor t off,u cannot"}
{"source": "dig?it s always on"}
{"source": "alwaysif you like hard rock that wayu need this tiny gig thingie"}
{"source": "Sounds ok on its own, not very loud or good quality at any high volume, but then when you plug in some good headphones, AWESOME! Great gain, tone, high volume, sounds awesome, perfect to use as a headphone amplifier with some play and effect"}
{"source": " Great sound, awesome deal"}
{"source": " Score! :D"}
{"source": "I have a small apartment in a small but densely populated apartment complex - space and noise is an issue"}
{"source": " As a beginning guitarist, I contemplated a small amp but decided on the Mini Tone Master (because in my apartment, the smaller the better)"}
{"source": " Also, I had no need for ample volume or a variety of controls being at the level that I am"}
{"source": " I just wanted something no-frills that was small, compact with enough quality sound to help me as I practice"}
{"source": " The Mini Tone Master delivers well"}
{"source": "I was pretty surprised at the range of sounds the little guy can produce (from distortion grungy to a softer bluesy tone)"}
{"source": " It does not come with a power adapter but we already have on in the apartments and works well with that or with a battery"}
{"source": " Battery life is also pretty good"}
{"source": " I've had the same battery in there for several months already, playing several times a week and sometimes leaving it on accidentally for a day or two and no signs of battery drain so far"}
{"source": "It is a little frustrating sometimes, as another reviewer mentioned, to remove the distortion but with enough fiddling, I found a setting that was acceptable to my ears"}
{"source": "While I didn't need volume, this little guy can be loud! No weakness there"}
{"source": "I also plugged an acoustic-electric classical guitar into the mini tone master and it also worked surprisingly well"}
{"source": "Overall dimensions 6 3/4\" x 6 1/2\" x 2 1/4\""}
{"source": " Very nice travel size"}
{"source": " Sound is about what you would expect"}
{"source": " It is basically a toy"}
{"source": " If you use more than 2 (of 10 max) gain, it sounds awful"}
{"source": " I turn guitar volume to max and adjust volume on the amp to desired level"}
{"source": " Tone works nicely to filter the output over all frequencies"}
{"source": " I am using it with a Fender Starcaster when I travel for work (hotel friendly)"}
{"source": " I think it's over priced but I think it looks good and it seems durable"}
{"source": "In the reviews for this item, there seems to be a lot of debate over what the Fender Mini Tone Master is and how we should evaluate it"}
{"source": "  Is it a toy, or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier?  Do we review it compared only to other \"mini amps\", or do other small combos costing under $100 creep into the discussion?  Well, I bought one for myself and the conclusion is this: It isn't the best way to practice guitar quietly at home, but it's also also fun little product at an affordable price that sounds slightly better than you'd expect"}
{"source": "APPEARANCE/DURABILITY - Actually, the aesthetics of the Mini Tone Master are one of my favorite things about it"}
{"source": "  This is a $40 conversation piece that I wouldn't mind having out on my work desk as a reminder of one of my favorite hobbies"}
{"source": "  It just so happens that it's a functioning amplifier you can plug into and practice with also?  The component actually used to make the amplifier are cheap, yet are put together in a convincing way"}
{"source": "  Take a step back and you'd swear the hard plastic housing was actually vinyl or leather"}
{"source": "  The \"grill cloth\" over the speakers is a nice facade for the hard plastic facing that protects the speakers"}
{"source": "  Actually, while the amp is cheap, it's also fairly durable"}
{"source": "  In fact, I just dumped it off my desk reaching over to write this review, and it seems to be working fine"}
{"source": "  (Phew!)  It should also be noted that this amp is powered either by a 9V battery or a 9V DC adapter (a BOSS pedal supply adapter will work, for example)"}
{"source": "  While the battery option is obviously nice for portability, the red \"ON\" light seemed noticeably dimmer with 9V's, and I can't say how long the battery will last"}
{"source": "  If you plan to have it in one place most of the time, the adapter is the preferred way to go"}
{"source": "SOUND - The concept of this amp is pretty ridiculous if you think about it - a one watt output with TWIN 2\" speakers"}
{"source": "  Given that each speaker is smaller than the \"tweeter\" on a large stereo speaker, you won't be surprised at all to hear that there's virtually no bass in the sound"}
{"source": "  It sounds like a poor 10W solid state amp, only shrunk down to a few inches"}
{"source": "  At the same time, that's kind of a remarkable feat for a miniature amplifier, and it puts out a fair amount of sound"}
{"source": "  I opted for the Mini Tone Master over some other options because it actually has a fair range of tones"}
{"source": "  Low Gain/High Volume produces pretty good clean tones, and with humbuckers and the gain turned up, it can get a bit raunchy"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately, the tone control either does nothing, or behaves completely irrationally"}
{"source": "  I haven't figured out which yet"}
{"source": "  I had it at \"5\" most of the time, but it didn't seem to cut much treble as I turned it up"}
{"source": "  Actually, it got the brightest around \"7\", and then almost became more muffled beyond that"}
{"source": "  But again, for a $40 mini amp, my expectations were not that much to begin with"}
{"source": "  I do like the four knobs, and the decision to make the power knob the same size as the other knobs was a subtle touch that prevents the cheaper feel of an on-off flat toy switch"}
{"source": "I expected the speaker to overdrive/break up if you pushed it too hard, and not in a \"tube-like\" manner"}
{"source": "  That wasn't necessarily the case, but there are other problems"}
{"source": "  Something internally rattles after the volume goes above \"4\", and it's not the speaker being overpowered"}
{"source": "  This is a common issue with cheap amps, and I might even pop it open to see what is rattling around"}
{"source": "  And the sound quality isn't objectively \"good\" by any means, but it is good enough to play amplified electric guitar and to hear the basic characteristics of your instrument and playing style"}
{"source": "ALTERNATIVES - The primary reason I rated this 4* instead of 5* really isn't any of the issues above (I am happy with the amp), but it's limited usefulness compared to the many alternatives for home/quiet practicing"}
{"source": "  My favorite of these, by far, are the Vox Amplugs, which are headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers"}
{"source": "  The sound quality those things pump into your headphones is of far greater quality (and volume/fullness) than anything this mini amp could do"}
{"source": "  Also, they are offered at $40 or $50, so it's simply a better value"}
{"source": "  Another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software"}
{"source": "  While sound quality and volume are often a problem with smartphone apps, the possibilities for effects, modeling, and recording are endless"}
{"source": "If you think about recent improvements in small size Bluetooth speakers, you realize that the sound quality on a device of this size could be far better than what the Mini Tone Master offers"}
{"source": "  At the same time, those speakers can cost up to $200, and premium sound quality was never the point of this amp"}
{"source": "  Your opinion of it will depend on your expectations, but if you don't take it too seriously, it's a cool little device"}
{"source": "  And, in my book, anything that allows you to practice more guitar than you would otherwise is nothing to laugh at"}
{"source": "So, these ended up being the wrong taper for my guitar, but that was my own fault due to some incorrect advice"}
{"source": "  Nonetheless, I put a couple in just to compare them to my old, plastic pins"}
{"source": "  What a difference!  Unquestionably, the sound board was far more sensitive"}
{"source": "  Sustain was much better and I got a richer tone, as opposed to the brighter tone some users reported"}
{"source": "  I should say, however, what I got was definitely the true, ebony wood pins with the inlay"}
{"source": "  I can't speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors"}
{"source": "  While these won't work due to size, I'll definitely be making the switch from plastic to ebony when I find the right size"}
{"source": "Thanks for the prompt and good service"}
{"source": " These are a quality product and really enhance my Guitar and I am very happy with them Thanks !!!"}
{"source": "When you get it, it looks so simple, so basic that you can't believe that it doesn't come with the mic, but companies got to make their money right? I use it with my Samson CL8 condenser and it is perfect"}
{"source": " Works great for podcasting, vocals or anything else you want to record"}
{"source": " The adjustment knob is a little tight but whatever, it does its job well"}
{"source": "This Sam SP01 can be easily modded for use with the Oktava MK319"}
{"source": " I found instructions through a google search"}
{"source": " The metal piece on the bottom of the mic holder must be removed"}
{"source": " Instead of hammering it out, I used two screwdrivers to pry it out"}
{"source": " That leaves a nice hole which is just a little too small to use"}
{"source": " Using my dremel tool, I was able to enlarge the hole just a bit"}
{"source": " As a guide the piece you remove fits in a small groove"}
{"source": " You must file down the sides til the groove is almost not visible"}
{"source": " Then your Oktava will fit just fine"}
{"source": " This mod is not easily reversible so keep that in mind before starting"}
{"source": " I'll post up a picture later"}
{"source": "I found the screw-on connector to not be that high quality"}
{"source": " It wanted to cross thread as I putting it on my mic stand"}
{"source": " So I wouldn't want to be taking it off and putting it back on frequently"}
{"source": " That's my only complaint about it"}
{"source": "Fits MXL Cube mics perfectly! Sturdy and easyt to setup"}
{"source": " Ordered two more"}
{"source": "Rare to get items these days that exceed expectation"}
{"source": "While the product came as described, the build quality felt a little lacking"}
{"source": " On the website it mentioned that it accepts the Shure KSM32 threading but it does not, so if you're threading matches the KSM32, look elsewhere"}
{"source": "I don't think I can say enough good things about the Samson SP01 Shockmount"}
{"source": "  Long story short I was trying to get a podcast going from scratch about three months ago"}
{"source": "  I did some research and discovered that a shockmount is necessary to keep any noise from anything securing the mic from being picked up by the mic while recording"}
{"source": "  A shockmount is an absolute must, especially when looking at using a tabletop mic stand where the table will also be used as a work surface"}
{"source": "The build quality is fantastic"}
{"source": "  I just recently purchased my THIRD shockmount for an additional mic to be used on the podcast"}
{"source": "What I've grown to appreciate so much is that it seems to fit just about any condenser microphone I can get my hands on"}
{"source": "  If you are considering buying this for your own condenser mic, make absolutely sure that your mic has threads on the bottom to be screwed into some type of stand or shockmount"}
{"source": "  Nearly all do, but some companies like Blue (Snowball, snowflake, etc"}
{"source": ") are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts"}
{"source": " I have used the MXL 007"}
{"source": "USB with this shockmount as well as the AT2020 USB and XLR version"}
{"source": "  The MXL fit like a glove, perfect"}
{"source": "  The AT2020, once threaded in, seemed just a bit loose, so I added a couple foam bumpers around the base to act as a washer"}
{"source": "  It made a tight fit and further insulated it from any sound interference from any movement"}
{"source": "In short, I haven't found a better shockmount for condenser mics"}
{"source": "  The attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand"}
{"source": "  Fantastic"}
{"source": "  Buy two of these!!  :)  Thanks Samson, now just make better mics!"}
{"source": "I have this paired with the Behringer C-1 Studio Condenser Microphone"}
{"source": "  It matches the mic well color-wise and fit"}
{"source": " The C-1 fits the mount perfectly"}
{"source": " I recommend this mount highly"}
{"source": "http://www"}
{"source": "amazon"}
{"source": "com/Behringer-C-1-Studio-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B000CZ0RLK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1358133926&sr;=8-1&keywords;=Behringer+C-1"}
{"source": "I recently bought an Audio Technica 2020 and was looking for a shockmount for it, I bought the one that Audio Technica makes and I was not satisfied with the quality, so I returned it and came across the Samson SP01"}
{"source": " My first thought was that it looked just like the shockmount I have for my Neumann TLM 103"}
{"source": " I immediately purchased it after seeing that people were using it with the AT 2020"}
{"source": " As soon as it arrived I put my AT 2020 in it and it looked stunning, after I mounted it on my on-desk mic stand I bumped the table a few times to see how it worked"}
{"source": " In short it works great, The SP01 isolates the mic extremely well"}
{"source": " I also tested the shockmount with my Studio Projects C1 and Rode k2 (both very heavy mics) and it works great"}
{"source": " One word of advice it seems that some people are having problems hooking this shockmount to their mic stand ( which I find extremely amusing)"}
{"source": " Like most shockmounts the Samson SP01 has an adapter that is too small for most US mic stands already in the mount ( the part where the shockmount connects to the mic stand)"}
{"source": " THIS IS EASY TO REMOVE!! All you have to do is take a coin and unscrew it!! Once you unscrew the adapter the shockmount will connect to your stand"}
{"source": "This Guitar Tuner is such a great and useful tool"}
{"source": " It teaches chords and got me to play my guitar better in less than one day"}
{"source": "Thanks, Austin Garcia"}
{"source": "I picked one of these up when they were being blown out cheaply at a big box store"}
{"source": "  Who doesn't need another pocket tuner to throw in the guitar bag, right?  The price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well"}
{"source": "  The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate"}
{"source": "  It gets you in the ballpark, but just barely"}
{"source": "  Strike a note once, and it's sharp"}
{"source": "  Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune"}
{"source": "  I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better"}
{"source": "I have been using them for about 6 months"}
{"source": " I play about twice a week and they have maintained a good sound over the past 6 months"}
{"source": " Not too difficult to tune either"}
{"source": "I don't know why more people don't use these: they're amazing"}
{"source": " I've used many strings and owned many guitars"}
{"source": " These aren't diamonds or gretsch but they're fantastic"}
{"source": " I love them on my strats"}
{"source": " The last and make playing a breeze"}
{"source": " I don't have any tone loss between these and "}
{"source": "10's"}
{"source": " If I do it's more than made up by the fact that I can play better with lighter strings"}
{"source": "Strings rust very easily, yield fairly poor tone and break often, though they have the same bending ability as "}
{"source": "09-"}
{"source": "42"}
{"source": "Weak sounding, and break very easily"}
{"source": " I would not recommend these to anyone other than those who literally have no callus developed"}
{"source": "I just cant get enough sustain out of the high E"}
{"source": "for my taste"}
{"source": " Tried them on Epi LP and a PRS"}
{"source": " I'm no Eric Clapton, and I dont use 4 amp heads nor do I employ 3 guys to work on my guitars, but thats my impression"}
{"source": " Just not enough umph"}
{"source": "Since, as of right now, this is the only review of this product on amazon"}
{"source": "com, I'll try to answer any questions you might have about the EHX Pocket Metal Muff Pedal"}
{"source": " This pedal is the model of simplicity; a volume control, a distortion control, and a switch that changes the amount (or lack thereof) of mid-scoop"}
{"source": " That's doesn't leave much room for tone tweaking, so \"tweakers\" beware! That being said, Electro-Harmonix did a commendable job of pre-setting useable treble and bass tone levels that should only require minor tweaking of your amp's eq to get it right where you want it"}
{"source": " Playing through my Fender hotrod deville amp, I was immediately shocked at how good this pedal sounded"}
{"source": " The bass was powerful and chunky, great for heavy metal palm-muting riffs; the treble had a good bite but it wasn't harsh; and all three midrange modes sounded great, depending on the application: Want just a flat midrange for a punchy tone? Just leave the mid-switch on the flat setting"}
{"source": " Want a slightly scooped midrange tone for a good all-round metal tone? Move the switch down to the low mid-scoop mode"}
{"source": " Do you want to play Master of Puppets by Metallica? The high mid-scoop mode is calling your name"}
{"source": " This pedal offers quite a bit of distortion, but I was amazed to find that even at the higher distortion levels, my tone remained clear and defined"}
{"source": " It didn't turn into a plastic-y, fuzzy mess like most distortion pedals *cough* metal zone *cough* will"}
{"source": " I will mention that this pedal isn't the best if you're looking for a more modern metal tone"}
{"source": " You won't get a slightly fizzy, ultra-gain (think Slipknot) sound out of this pedal"}
{"source": " Rather it offers a very crunchy, defined roar more characteristic of the pre-dual rectifier mesa boogie amplifiers"}
{"source": "In conclusion, I give this pedal 5 stars because it does what its designed to do very well; this version of the metal muff line isn't designed to be highly versatile and \"tweakable\" in and of itself; get the metal muff with top boost pedal if you want a 3-band eq and a boost function"}
{"source": " This pedal is designed to be a very simple, small box of pure classic metal tone, and that's exactly what it accomplishes"}
{"source": "Within just three seconds of using the Electro-Harmonix Pocket Metal Muff Pedal, I knew it was a winner"}
{"source": " It delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultra-easy to use"}
{"source": " Although it doesn't have a tone dial, it doesn't need one"}
{"source": " And I say that after trying it through a small tube amp (15w), a small digital amp (40w), a guitar with humbuckers, and a guitar with single-coil pickups"}
{"source": " The closest it has to a tone dial is the scoop switch just above the on/off switch"}
{"source": " As its name suggests, this allows one to choose how much the mid tones will be \"scooped"}
{"source": "\" It has three settings (no scoop to maximal scoop), and all sound great"}
{"source": " Fans of sustain will love this box, for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain"}
{"source": " The pedal is extremely small, which most would regard as a plus"}
{"source": " I bought this after watching a professional-looking YouTube demonstration of it"}
{"source": " It more than lived up to my expectations"}
{"source": " If I lost this box, I'd immediately order another one"}
{"source": " I have zero regrets"}
{"source": "this is an amazing acoustic amp for my classical guitar"}
{"source": " i use this to play in the Church and a friend of mine approached me and said that the sound is really crisp and bold"}
{"source": " i was happy"}
{"source": "I am both a bass player and a fidelity freak, always fussing over tone settings"}
{"source": " This tiny amp packs BIG sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard "}
{"source": " and even my bass"}
{"source": " The CD input has NO controls but is a very useful feature just the same"}
{"source": " Having Behringer mics and a UB802 mixer, I banked on this being a good amp and was NOT disappointed"}
{"source": " The 3-band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument"}
{"source": " No 15-watt amp will compete with live drums OR outdoor settings"}
{"source": " and do NOT expect 2 instruments to sound perfect together, but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds, this amp will impress you"}
{"source": " Every musician should have one of these around"}
{"source": " Money well spent!"}
{"source": "Hearing ourselves the way we sound to others is of the essence in music"}
{"source": " This small, acoustic Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 amplifier gives the musician/singer the needed outside feedback to get things sounding right"}
{"source": "No one hears themselves the way they sound to others"}
{"source": " This simple reality must be understood and somehow corrected for by anyone recording music"}
{"source": " This is why performers in the studio wear headphones while recording and why a small acoustic amplifier is a necessary piece of gear for an acoustic guitar playing, singing song writer"}
{"source": " The Behringer Ultracoustic AT108 acoustic amplifier more than does the job"}
{"source": "As the owner of eight completely acoustic guitars, I thought a lot for years about trying amplification"}
{"source": " I probably never hesitated with ambivalence about any other purchase in my life"}
{"source": " Much to my delight, together with a passive, inexpensive hole-mounted pick-up (the Seymour Duncan SA3SC Woody) , an inexpensive Audio- Technica vocal microphone and this Behringer AT108, I can hear a fullness and richness that actually makes good instruments sound even better!At least as importantly, it allows me to hear myself more the way I am heard by others who will not hear me, as I do in part, from the resonations inside my skull"}
{"source": "One of the most universal and predictably shocking experiences anyone who records their own voice is struck by is how different it sounds when recorded than it does when they are singing or speaking it"}
{"source": " The mechanics of this ubiquitous situation are not difficult to fathom"}
{"source": "To hear what those listening hear, you have to arrange things so as to hear the sound coming TO you, not FROM you"}
{"source": " That is where an amplifier comes in handy"}
{"source": " It aims your own sound back at you so you can hear something a lot closer to what an audience would hear"}
{"source": "When we 'hear' ourselves without any external amplification or direct audio feedback, we are 'hearing' a combination of the sounds being processed through our ears as well as those vibrations and sounds that are created by the vibrations in our heads"}
{"source": " The people who hear us, only hear us through their ears"}
{"source": " The two experiences are not the same"}
{"source": "To discover how we really sound to others, we can go about it two ways"}
{"source": " First, we can go ahead and record ourselves then listen and be astounded at how different we sound from how we thought we were sounding while recording, or we can put our practice through electronics - either through an external amplifier or through headphones, so that we can hear ourselves more closely to the way we will be heard by others"}
{"source": "As an acoustic guitar player, I recently invested in a small, specifically acoustic amplifier, the Behringer Ultracoustic AT108, and have found the results to be simply astounding as I can now, for the first time, practice my songs until they sound the way I would like them to sound to others before recording them"}
{"source": "For a small amplifier that successfully replicates, electronically, the deep richness of an old tube acoustic amplifier, this Behringer AT108 provides amply volume for both the instrument and separate input voice, along with a three section equalizer, to provide the self-accompanying guitarist with the sound of what s/he really sound like to others"}
{"source": " It can, initially, be a rather shocking experience!Technically, this AT108 is at the low end of the famous Behringer line"}
{"source": " Although the company is based in Germany, this box is built in China to their specifications"}
{"source": " Solidly built and encased in a brown vinyl wrapping, it sports:- 15 Watts of Power amp output,- An 8\" dual-cone full-range loudspeaker with 4 Ohm impedance and a powerrating of 20 Watts,- Inputs for an instrument (1/4\" TS mono connector,) a microphone ( BalancedXLR) and for CDs (1/4\" TRS stereo connector,)- A headphone output connector ( 1/4\" TRS stereo connector, and- Three (Low, Mid and High Range) frequency controllers"}
{"source": "The unit measures approximately 13 X 14 X 7 inches, weighs just over 11 pounds and is easily portable"}
{"source": " It comes delivered with 13 feet of instrument ready plug-in cabling"}
{"source": "Finally, to answer a question I had that caused me to hesitate for years before buying a small acoustic amp, it does NOT make an acoustic guitar sound, in any way, like an electric guitar"}
{"source": " The sound is that of a deepened and amplified acoustic"}
{"source": " The natural tones are enhanced, not rendered tinny or 'electrified"}
{"source": "'It is at home in a room when you are alone practicing or on a stage in a small venue"}
{"source": " The 15 amps pack a wallop and it can blast pretty loudly for its petite and easily portable configuration"}
{"source": "At a current on line retail of somewhere between $75 - $95, an entire enhanced world of acoustic playing, practicing and listening is now open to me"}
{"source": " The Behringer AT108 just might turn out to be one of the smartest investments I have ever made on behalf of my acoustic guitar playing, singing and recording"}
{"source": "I have played, listened to, and used audio amps for over 4 decades, and while I haven't owned every name brand amp on the planet, I do know my way around them well enough to spot a good deal when I see one"}
{"source": " This is a nice little practice amp for electrified acoustic guitar, with an input for a mic (XLR - no phantom power) and a CD player or other audio source"}
{"source": " It also has a headphone output (1/4 inch)"}
{"source": " It has three tone controls and separate volume for the guitar and mic inputs"}
{"source": "I got this originally for my mother, who used to sing in an Andrews Sisters-type group back in the day"}
{"source": " She still loves to sing, and wanted a small amp and mic to practice and do the occasional small jam"}
{"source": " She hasn't had the opportunity to do that yet, but I have tested the amp and put it through its paces"}
{"source": " I think it will work fine for the kind of thing she has in mind"}
{"source": " The lack of reverb or processing for the mic is a bit of a drawback, but considering what I paid for it, I can't complain"}
{"source": "Now, this is not a gigging amp, at least not in my opinion (your mileage may vary)"}
{"source": " It is small, solid state, with an 8 inch speaker, and 15 watts of power (I haven't measured the exact output, so I'm taking Behringer's word on that)"}
{"source": " I like Behringer, and they can turn out some pretty good gear, within its limits"}
{"source": "I like the sound of the amp with my Carvin acoustic guitar with a Fishman preamp"}
{"source": " It is an inexpensive practice amp, so I don't expect the same kind of quality I would from a more serious combo amp"}
{"source": " The 8 inch speaker is obviously not going to give the kind of sound quality as a good 12 inch, no matter what"}
{"source": " The question is, does this amp provide the sonic quality and flexibility needed to allow serious practice work, composition, or just moderate entertainment value? For me, that answer is a clear \"yes"}
{"source": "\"However, this is an inexpensive practice amp, and if you approach it with that attitude, I think you will find it a nice little amp"}
{"source": " Don't plan on using it for your next tour with Manhattan Transfer, Seal, or Celine Dion"}
{"source": "I was a bit skeptical about buying this, but after reading the reviews I thought why not"}
{"source": " It is actually a good little practice amp"}
{"source": " I'm still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood"}
{"source": " It gives me the portability I needed to move about my house"}
{"source": " I was using a mixer that's hooked to one of my PCs and using that sound card for sound"}
{"source": " That works great, but sometimes I don't want to be tied down to the PC"}
{"source": " I use the PC arrangement for recording and the amp for private relaxing guitar playing wherever I want to have it"}
{"source": " I recommend this little amp wholeheartedly"}
{"source": " Just be mindful that it isn't a $500 Marshall amp, but it does well in a pinch"}
{"source": "I just can't believe how loud this little baby is"}
{"source": " I also have a 180watts Behringer keyboard amp (4 inputs, with lot of FX) but it's a littl heavy to move around"}
{"source": "This little amp does everything I need for small gathering"}
{"source": " I tried everything as soon as I received it:1) guitar (classic), mandolin, acoustic guitar all sound the way they normally sound in this ampActually, the classical guitar sounds much better and this encourage me to play more thru this amp"}
{"source": "2) the microphone, although no reverb or echo, is good enough for singing, sounds as the true voice of the singer3) the MP3 input is 1/4\", which I prefer over the little 1/8\", volume must be controlled by the MP3 player itself4) guitar and mic have separate volume control (we really need it)"}
{"source": "In summary, it's ready to be used right out of the box"}
{"source": "It only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy"}
{"source": "It's solid built"}
{"source": " Maximized all buttons and hardly heard any noise"}
{"source": " Manufacture said it's for practice; to me, it serves the purpose"}
{"source": "I say perfection, because this amp does exactly what I wanted it to do"}
{"source": "  It is also a great value for what it does"}
{"source": "  It offers ample volume for small venues"}
{"source": "  I love having two mic inputs and the CD input"}
{"source": "  The Behringer AT108, along with my Fender amp, gives me plenty of performance capability"}
{"source": "The warmth and the richness issue from this thing, just the way I'd hoped"}
{"source": " I could not be more pleased with this product"}
{"source": " It actually delivers much more sound than I expected"}
{"source": "this is a must have pedal for any rock player, tight compressed distortion sound , you could play with the EQ to get the sound your looking for, it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion, It's build to last forever, the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibility's"}
{"source": "the only downside is the battery, get the power adapter , batteries wont last more than 2 or 3 days and you have to unscrew the back to replace it"}
{"source": "Overall, I'm really happy with this pedal"}
{"source": "Dang that's metal"}
{"source": " Were the first words I said when plugging this thing in to the line"}
{"source": " With a wide range of sound and versatility with just one pedal and two buttons is awesome"}
{"source": " The only issue was with some manufacturing detail"}
{"source": " The input and out put jacks are screwed up and nearly broke my cables when trying to set it up for the first time"}
{"source": " The buttons were way to stiff and made a horrid crunch the first time I used it and after talking to amazon it turns out that just seems to be how it is"}
{"source": " Be sides that its metal, nothing more nothing less"}
{"source": " Razor sharp high ends or some butt draggin muddy slop of sound either way your covered with this pedal"}
{"source": "This is a pretty awesome pedal, especially if you're going for more of an 80's or 90's metal sound that's more chunky and defined than fizzy"}
{"source": " Think earlier Mesa models, like the famous Mark III C+ that was used by Metallica on the Master of Puppets album"}
{"source": " Of course no pedal can perfectly replicate that sound, but the Metal Muff does a pretty amazing impression"}
{"source": "Some of the best aspects of the Metal Muff include:1"}
{"source": " Great clarity and definition, even on higher gain settings"}
{"source": " Seriously, most high gain pedals cause you to lose a lot of definition in your playing, but the metal muff doesn't do that"}
{"source": " So especially for the lead guitarist, this should be a major selling point"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " Wide range to the tone controls"}
{"source": " With some pedals it's really hard to hear a difference when you adjust the tone controls, but not so with the metal muff"}
{"source": " You can easily dial in the sound you're after, or maybe even find a new sound you like even better"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " The quality of construction is absolutely superb"}
{"source": " Everything about the pedal is rugged and durable"}
{"source": " I'd feel totally comfortable gigging without a backup"}
{"source": "On a different note, I've only used this pedal with my Fender Hotrod tube amp, and it sounds great"}
{"source": " However, I prefer the Rocktron Zombie pedal to the Metal Muff(see my review of the Zombie for more info on that)"}
{"source": " However, the Rocktron Zombie doesn't sound good through solid state amps"}
{"source": " I mention this because if you're using a tube amp, I honestly feel that the Zombie is a better option"}
{"source": " But if you're playing through a solid state amp, the I've read that the metal muff still shines"}
{"source": " Just something to consider"}
{"source": "To conclude, this pedal is awesome if you're looking for a pedal to give an all-round good, straight-up metal sound"}
{"source": " Sure, it's a bit of a one-trick pony, but it's a pretty good trick"}
{"source": " If you're looking for an ultra high-gain distortion monster then look else where, but otherwise I recommend giving the Metal Muff a look"}
{"source": "Not much to say about a basic bag"}
{"source": "  It fits a dreadnaught acoustic 6 string guitar, has good padding, and has a large front pouch for music and small (fairly flat) items like a tuner, winder or spare strings"}
{"source": "  Has a carry handle/strap, but no shoulder straps on the back as some others have"}
{"source": "  Seems well made"}
{"source": "Just an all around nice case, good construction, good zipper and padded enough without causing it to become hard to maneuver"}
{"source": "  This isn't one of those semi walled cases, this is just a normal gig bag"}
{"source": "  Works for me, in fact I bought another for my classical"}
{"source": "I've been using this for my 'beater' guitar, and it has done just fine in the back of my car, etc"}
{"source": " It isn't bulletproof, but you'd have to pay a lot more for airline level protection anyway"}
{"source": " Medium padding and a decent sized zipper pocket, more than I expected for the price"}
{"source": "Hey, it's a fun little toy, but I've seen this thing going in most places for an even $100 which is ridiculous"}
{"source": " I was lucky enough to get it on Amazon for $80"}
{"source": " Once you get over the novelty of it it will sit on top of your amp to collect dust"}
{"source": "  I've made some cool effects and written a many a great riff with this but it's not one of those tools you'll use every song"}
{"source": " unless you're so amazing you can make it work every song! Learning how to use it properly and finding the nuances of making it work is half the fun, but once you get it, and you're over it, you wonder why you wasted $100 on something that shouldn't have cost more than $50"}
{"source": " It's essentially a 9V battery covered by plastic with a pretty blue light"}
{"source": " This was one of those impulse buys that grabbed a hold of me when I had nothing better to use my money on"}
{"source": "I first became aware of the EBow way back in the 80's when the song &#34;Big Country&#34; by the band Big Country came out"}
{"source": " They used it to simulate bagpipes and I always loved that sound"}
{"source": " I finally purchased an EBow about a year  ago"}
{"source": " I'm a songwriter and record my own demos at home"}
{"source": " I also perform live in a cover band"}
{"source": " I don't use the EBow very often but when I do, it really adds to the performance"}
{"source": " I recorded an EBow track for an original song in a passage where there was only acoustic guitar and it added another dimension to the overall sound and made my recording sound more professional"}
{"source": " For live playing it can be a little tricky because sometimes it takes a few seconds to get the strings to start vibrating"}
{"source": " With practice, I think this could improve"}
{"source": " I play the solo on STP's &#34;Sour Girl&#34; and it sounds very much like the original recording"}
{"source": " People in the audience tend to take notice during that solo and I get questions about how it works"}
{"source": " I have not had good luck with arpeggios but again, practice could improve this"}
{"source": "The octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound"}
{"source": " Battery life is exceptional"}
{"source": " I have only had to replace the battery once"}
{"source": " Overall, I think this is a great product"}
{"source": " I wish it had been a bit less expensive but if I lost it, I'd buy another one"}
{"source": "If you've seen the youtube videos, then you know what this can do"}
{"source": "I especially appreciate that it has the two modes: one for regular sustain and one for a 'feedback' sustain"}
{"source": "They can be switched back and forth even while you're sustaining a note"}
{"source": "I can't wait to use this with my band - we'll have to cover \"With or Without You\" for sure now!["}
{"source": "]"}
{"source": "I wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself"}
{"source": " I wanted to like it, but unfortunately, it just isn't my thing"}
{"source": " I played it all but 2 weeks until I got bored and stopped"}
{"source": " It now sits on my amp collecting dust"}
{"source": " I pick it up occasionally, but I always end up putting it back down shortly after"}
{"source": " I am sorry, I just can't dig it"}
{"source": " :(Edit: So apparently, a lot of people dislike my review and are insulting me in the comments section of this post"}
{"source": " Normally, I'd just laugh at these no-lifers, but I am sick of getting constant e-mails from internet tough guys, so I'd like to formally state  that this is not a bad product"}
{"source": " It can be fun, but the effects it gives are not worth $100, and its build quality is not worth $100"}
{"source": " Like I said in the original post, I became bored of this item roughly two weeks after purchase and this has not changed"}
{"source": " The last time I picked it up was to harvest the battery for the blackout  active pickups on my schecter"}
{"source": " Its not that I \"didn't know how to use it\" like one of the morons in the comments section stated, this product requires very little skill to use"}
{"source": " Read the manual if you are having trouble, it explains in great detail the techniques you can utilize with this device"}
{"source": "Would I recommend it? If you have a hundred bucks to drop, go for it"}
{"source": " If not, your money is best spent elsewhere"}
{"source": "The e-bow is a great tool for any musician looking to get a really neatethereal sound out of their guitar"}
{"source": " Great tool!"}
{"source": "works ok for the price and features it is fine"}
{"source": " get the batteries it did not came with any"}
{"source": " I am using it for a dj karaoke system I do recommend it"}
{"source": "Do you have a Hercules guitar stand? Then this will make transporting it easy"}
{"source": " It seems like a gimmick, but I have two stands and it's nice to be able to grab both of them by using the bag straps, and still be able to carry more gear with my other hand"}
{"source": "I'm used to conventional steel finger picks"}
{"source": " These actually work really well as long as you don't play hard, like I sometimes do with my other picks"}
{"source": " Playing hard really hurts my exposed finger pads that are ordinarily covered by regular picks"}
{"source": " However, these allow for better touch and expression when playing softly"}
{"source": "Don't know what the delay was but it took forever to get here"}
{"source": "  The picks look like they will work although they are a little hard to bend, we will see if it's what I was looking for, thanks!"}
{"source": "I play with fingernails and just can't control standard metal banjo-style fingerpicks because I can't feel the strings"}
{"source": " I used Alaska picks for years, which are very good"}
{"source": " These are better"}
{"source": " They give the control of nails, yet the tone and protection of metal - and I can feel the strings! Muting, harmonics, everything"}
{"source": "  If you play with nails and want finger picks, these are for you"}
{"source": "I got this yesterday, and everything was alright, except that two of the three Mics worked"}
{"source": " One was dead"}
{"source": " I tested all three of them with the same, and different cable, and made sure that the the On/Off switch was on"}
{"source": " It was first mic I tested of the three, and the dead one of the three"}
{"source": " Everything was good except for that one Microphone"}
{"source": "These are pretty standard dynamic mics, and for what you pay the quality is good"}
{"source": " I use them as room mics mainly, for which they perform admirably"}
{"source": " I've only used them once for (backup) vocals, and the results were good"}
{"source": " Would recommend these for folks on a budget"}
{"source": " Also, the case is nice"}
{"source": "Made of all metal,looks and feels well made"}
{"source": " Sounds clear no hum or buzz comes with a nice case and that a plus"}
{"source": "The 3-pack is a FANTASTIC deal"}
{"source": " I've been around mics under $100 for 30 years, and when compared to other mics in the $50-$100 range, they are as good or better! Good lows and clean highs without ANY hiss"}
{"source": " Absolutely NO whine or hiss when used with a mic preamp"}
{"source": " Don't miss out on this GREAT deal"}
{"source": "These don't sound all that great on stage or at rehearsal with the my other SM58s and Beta 58s in a band situation, but that actually wasn't the purpose of these microphones"}
{"source": " the real purpose was speech through a ceiling speaker system, at which they excel"}
{"source": " The facility we use these at, the mics have a habit of walking away, or escaping maybe"}
{"source": " stolen? Perhaps"}
{"source": " They sound great through the ceiling, they have on/off switches, and they're cheap, we can just buy another box of 3 in a few months when we're down to 1 again"}
{"source": " Seems like they'll last forever, too bad they keep wandering off on us"}
{"source": "I love these microphones, I really do"}
{"source": " I also believe that it was really cool they threw in the microphone holders and the case is quite nice"}
{"source": " The 2 things I did not like was 1, the microphone has to be really close to your mouth to get a good sound out of it, otherwise it does not sound as crisp"}
{"source": " 2, although it was nice of them to include the microphone holders, the items they work with are very limited so make sure that they match up with a microphone stand you want to buy or else it won't screw in"}
{"source": " It is good to be aware the wire that connects to this microphone is an XLR Female, so buy the correct wire when connecting to an amp/speaker"}
{"source": " For the price I really do recommend these, as long as your fine with having to put the microphone centered,and close to your mouth"}
{"source": " Overall a great product"}
{"source": "Plugged 'em in to my PA's Yamaha mixer and tried out my effects processor and they sound great! Better than the Nady Starpower mic I also bought from Amazon"}
{"source": " These seem like they will last and I plan to buy these as long as they stay the same price"}
{"source": "I was looking for a financially good deal"}
{"source": " The price was so reasonable, I said, \"How can something this cheap be that good\","}
{"source": "well they were a great investment"}
{"source": " I use them all the time and have had people ask me where I purchased such a great sounding cadiod microphone"}
{"source": " When I told them the price, they thought I was pulling there leg,"}
{"source": "I wasn't"}
{"source": " The case is plastic, foam and clips"}
{"source": " Three good clips would cost you ten dollars alone, now compare for yourself"}
{"source": " I'd buy these again in a heart beat"}
{"source": " I just might buy another 3-pack!!"}
{"source": "Okay well I lied in subject line, bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand"}
{"source": "  I can say that with authority since I run KJ shows 6 nights a week and have for the last 20+ years, so I know good singers when I hear them"}
{"source": "  And they will ask if I have a shure SM58, to which i reply Hell No, you think I'm going to put a 58 in the hands of a careless drunk?  The more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe"}
{"source": "  Some also drop the mic or worse, spike the mic"}
{"source": "  I'd rather lose one of these Behringers than a 58"}
{"source": "  Or a wireless 58"}
{"source": "  Sound wise these are great for their intended purpose"}
{"source": "  If you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic, this is the bargain"}
{"source": "two weeks in and I can already feel it drying up"}
{"source": " Good for peace of mind instead of using a wet sponge humidifier and just keeping the humidity controlled, but it seems it will cost me a fortune if I keep using these"}
{"source": "I will no longer use other humidifying methods for my BR-243A"}
{"source": " There's too much that can go wrong with over or under humidifying a solid wood acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " Woods swell and shrink based on moisture vapor and it can also affect the tone quality"}
{"source": "The beauty of these is that the gel packs maintain consistent humidity and make any changes gradually"}
{"source": "They say 2-4 months, I've never come close to even a month"}
{"source": " Usually 3 weeks and they are toast in a guitar case not opened more than twice in that 3 weeks"}
{"source": "  If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is"}
{"source": "  I don't recommend these"}
{"source": "My bass-playing has gone on for 50 years,"}
{"source": "and during the time I've tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars"}
{"source": "  I know from that experience how the quality and construction of strings has improved over the decades"}
{"source": "This set of D'Addario chromes is remarkable"}
{"source": "  It's a flat wound string with all the smoothness and quiet character found in that string type"}
{"source": "  In this set, I especially like the 4th string at "}
{"source": "100&#34; dia"}
{"source": " This set, by its design, gives a very strong and powerful signal to the amp,"}
{"source": "and therefore makes even my Schecter Diamond Series 4-string sound largely like the early P-bass with bottom to spare"}
{"source": "  There's a 'however'"}
{"source": " and this is it,"}
{"source": "this string is NOT muddy sounding like many flat wounds"}
{"source": "  Clean, bold, and full of smooth overtones that work well"}
{"source": "  I really like them"}
{"source": "  The price is fair, and we'll see what kind of life they exhibit, as I don't want to be spending lots of hard-to-find cash on new strings at a frequency that is aggravating"}
{"source": "Don P"}
{"source": "these are a lighter tensioned version of their popular J74 strings, the pitch is somewhat lower than the J74s and the effort needed to fret a note is much less, nice for old fingers and beginners"}
{"source": "Great sound over the original strings"}
{"source": "  I did find these strings a little difficult to install because of the size"}
{"source": "  They will draw blood if your not careful so watch it while replacing the small strings"}
{"source": "  The G and the D were fine"}
{"source": "so i just got this product, haven't used it!package looks ok,strings are pakced in one plastic bagi can't wait to try this one, i've also bought Martin M1400, ghs silk and steel, will come back with results!"}
{"source": "No strings I've tried are like this, it doesn't have a strong character but work together with your guitar"}
{"source": " My seagull now sound mellow with brightness! Also this string is perfect for finger picking, I love it!"}
{"source": "These D'Addario silk and steel strings are excellent for finger picking"}
{"source": "  A couple of notes, though:  (1) on the positive side, they are made in the U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": "A"}
{"source": " of American-produced materials (unlike silk and steel strings by a famous American guitar company whose name starts with \"M,\" which are assembled south of the border); (2) on the negative side, they cost more than M-----'s silk and steel strings; (3) in general, silk and steel strings squeak more on position changes than straight steel strings, especially more than flat-wound acoustic strings; (4) the tone is very nice and mellow, sort of a cross between flat-wound steel strings and nylon strings; (5) the D'Addario folk set is very easy on the fingers and therefore are ideal if you play a lot, or if you primarily play a fairly light gauge electric string and only acoustic on occasion; (6) they really work best for finger picking (whatever you do, don't use metal finger picks), and are less effective than steel strings for flat picking"}
{"source": "I have an Alvarez Yari acoustic guitar that I absolutely love"}
{"source": " but I have wanted, missed a warmer tone (the body of this guitar is slightly smaller than many and I had always assumed that I would never be able to get the tone I wanted in the low end"}
{"source": " as compared to the bass enhancing body of a typical dreadknot style of guitar, for example"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "Then a friend recommended I try these strings, and, to my mind, my guitar has seen nothing short of a transformation!Here is the gorgeous tone I had missed!I am now on my second set of strings, and I am hooked"}
{"source": "One thing: I have heard that these strings aren't as durable as other strings"}
{"source": "However, this hasn't bothered me, as tend to finger-pick and soft strum, and so, this possibility hasn't become an issue for me"}
{"source": "And while I would make no claim that everyone would have the great experience I did, I would wholeheartedly recommend trying these strings to anyone looking for a variation in tone"}
{"source": "The fact that it is easier on the fingers is another reason to give these a try! Thumbs up!"}
{"source": "I bought this to replace an actual full-out PA and was VERY pleasantly surprised"}
{"source": "Pros: GREAT price, VERY loud (as well as clear)"}
{"source": " Also compact and very durable"}
{"source": "Cons: None"}
{"source": "Bottom Line: As a monitor look no further"}
{"source": " I use it as a PA for practicing and it is a God-send"}
{"source": " Buy now!"}
{"source": "I was looking for a small, high quality monitor for use in the Praise Band at church"}
{"source": " I needed to run my Boss GT-100 and vocals through it on stage"}
{"source": " This little speaker is more than loud enough for a good size stage with reasonable stage volume"}
{"source": " It is built extremely well/very solid and sounds incredible"}
{"source": " The volume and sound quality coming from this is simply amazing"}
{"source": " I still chuckle when someone asks me to turn my guitar up and I do and all this sound comes from this little speaker sitting on the floor"}
{"source": " There is a threaded mic stand socket on the bottom, but I place it on the floor and angle it back by putting my DI box underneath it"}
{"source": " Between this and my GT-100 I have the ultimate direct guitar system, with inputs still available for a monitor feed from the main board"}
{"source": " Simply fantastic piece of equipment"}
{"source": "One of these is more than sufficient for small venues as a main keyboard amp with channels for a mic and backing track"}
{"source": " A pair of these connected via the stereo link jacks will handle larger venues including outside gigs"}
{"source": " They can  be configured as a master/slave set-up with a single link cable (a 1/4 inch speaker cable), or with two cables two fully functioning amps that can handle ten inputs, assuming five inputs per CM-30"}
{"source": " In reality the single cable configuration is more than sufficient"}
{"source": "The low, mid and high range frequencies are perfect for either a piano or organ"}
{"source": " I have run both aRoland RD-300NX Digital PianoandRoland V-Combo VR-700"}
{"source": " The grand piano setting on the RD-300NX sounds like the real thing out of this amp, as does the B3 emulation from the V-Combo"}
{"source": "I did a direct comparison with this against aMackie SRM150 5"}
{"source": "25-Inch Compact Active PA Systemand the sound of this beat it hand's down"}
{"source": " Bear in mind that this was designed for keyboards so the sound has been optimized for instruments in their frequency range"}
{"source": "Vocals through the channel with the XLR are adequate, but not particularly spectacular"}
{"source": " Also, there is no phantom power or ground lift features, so you will not be able to use this in a studio with condenser mics or correct electrical imbalances"}
{"source": " That leads me to conclude that this is best for live performances"}
{"source": "I use mine as a powered main, but it is designed to function as a monitor with the main controls on the front of the box"}
{"source": " That is somewhat inconvenient when using it as a main because the controls will be facing away from you"}
{"source": " However, once the levels are set during sound check you can control the levels via your instrument's volume and EQ controls"}
{"source": "There are a few things to note regarding mounting this on a mic stand"}
{"source": " First, the manual recommends that the total height from the top of the CM-30 to the floor not exceed 43 inches"}
{"source": " I agree"}
{"source": " This may be relatively small, but it's heavy at over twelve pounds and the center of gravity at the limited of the recommended height is fairly high"}
{"source": " It's easy to tip over, especially of you are not using a tripod style mic stand with the legs fully extended"}
{"source": "I play guitar and sing in relatively small places, such as cafes"}
{"source": "  I previously used a Fender Acoustasonic Jr and I got tired of lugging it (about 50 lbs) and all of my other gig equipment around"}
{"source": " With the CM-30 I can get it (12 lbs), mic stands, music stand, mic, and various cables and etc into a medium sized rolling duffel"}
{"source": "  That means I can haul everthing I need in one trip"}
{"source": "  A big plus"}
{"source": "I like the sound quality I get"}
{"source": "  My guitar is an acoustic Alverez with onboard preamp and my mic is a Shure SM-57"}
{"source": "  The Roland doesn't have a huge amount of volume, but if you're looking for something that sounds natural and is easy to transport, set up and take down, this is a good choice"}
{"source": " (If I used it a with a passive guitar pick-up, I'd want external preamp"}
{"source": ")  Think of it as as a sound booster for when you are playing in a bigger space than your living room"}
{"source": "I'm also thinking I will use it in larger rooms as a personal monitor with my Acoustasonic Jr"}

{"source": "Was I surprised when I got this thing home and put it through some rounds with a Kurzweil PC2 and SP2"}
{"source": "  It's little more than a compact brick, but it appears to have the power of my KC150 and, more importantly, in terms of \"listenability\" it sounds like its several heavens apart from the KC 150 or 350 (those ever-present Roland KC amps will make any piano, including Rolands, sound uninspiring if not boring during the course of a four-hour gig)"}
{"source": "  This latest contender covers the entire piano range, effortlessly, smoothly, providing rich yet responsive bass where its needed and brilliant but not strident highs"}
{"source": "  Perhaps some would judge the sound a trifle \"colored"}
{"source": "\"  If so, I'll take the coloration any day to the untempered sounds I've been getting from electric keyboards"}
{"source": "  The mid-range is tight and controlled, with the upper register \"growing out\" of it gradually but unmistakably"}
{"source": "  By contrast, the upper register on the heavy-duty KC amps strikes like a serpent, leaping out of the mix like home-brewed white lightning  hitting the palate after it's just gotten accustomed to a vintage Bordeaux"}
{"source": "I even compared this little thing to my previous standard--the Roland Cube 60 that had preceded the KC150 (which has been around too long)"}
{"source": "  This new one was smoother, bending to the bass notes like a gracious willow and springing to the top ones like fresh spring birch"}
{"source": "  In other words, even the Roland Cube sounded uneven and rough compared to this latest overachiever, which handled the tones of the scale like a single portamento, revealing no holes in any of the registers"}
{"source": "Playing any instrument or amplifier on the job can lead to a judgment radically different from the one made at home"}

{"source": "I bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage"}
{"source": "  I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D-28, but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars"}
{"source": "Imagine my profound disappointment"}
{"source": "Really, Boss??? This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours"}
{"source": "  This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the \"Top\" control higher than about 9 o'clock"}
{"source": "  At first I thought I must have a defective unit, but then I started reading reviews on-line"}
{"source": "  Seems like it is part of the design"}
{"source": " It's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz"}
{"source": " Totally unusable, as far as I'm concerned"}
{"source": " By the way, I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat)"}
{"source": "Didn't purchase this pedal from Amazon, but wanted to write a review"}
{"source": " I wasn't expecting much from this pedal, but it is quite good"}
{"source": " Is it a completely authentic acoustic sound? I'd have to say"}
{"source": " not exactly"}
{"source": " But it's kind of close, and it's a far cry from lowering your volume and raising your master, which still sounds distinctly electric"}
{"source": " So far, the setting with the most convincing acoustic tones would be the Jumbo setting"}
{"source": " Again, don't expect to sound completely acoustic -- it's a nice way to at least approach that sound"}
{"source": " Check out some Youtube tests before buying"}
{"source": "It's &#34;okay&#34; on my Blues Jr"}
{"source": " NOS, but really shines on my Crate TD-35, which is a brighter amp and less colored"}
{"source": " I zero the spring verb and use the pedal's onboard reverb for best results"}
{"source": "Used it with my Strat and also a humbuckered guitar with a Duncan Hotrod set"}
{"source": " Sounds good with both guitars -- especially neck and center positions"}
{"source": "Pedal is solid"}
{"source": " Be advised that it comes with the 9-volt from the factory, so if you use a DC power source then you'll want to remove the battery"}
{"source": " To do so, you'll see a black knob at the base of the pedal"}
{"source": " Just unscrew it, pop the hood, and remove the battery"}
{"source": " Overally, solid pedal as you'd expect from Boss"}
{"source": "A word of warning"}
{"source": " Not sure if it's my setup, but when the AC-3 is in my effects chain (not a loop, but in front of the Blues Jr), I started getting really bad static sounds that sounded like the amp was malfunctioning -- burnt tube or the like"}
{"source": " When I run it alone to my Crate, I haven't experienced this"}
{"source": " Could be any number of things in my effects chain, so check if others experience this"}
{"source": "I'm wondering if a small, cheap acoustic amp would help augment the acoustic tone with the pedal"}
{"source": " Never tried running an electric into an acoustic amp"}
{"source": " Not sure how a non-piezo pickup would affect the tone"}
{"source": " Anyone know about this?"}
{"source": "The Boss AC-3 is a serviceable acoustic simulator"}
{"source": " I am the only guitarist and in my playing environment (children's church) and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric"}
{"source": " The AC3 does that job"}
{"source": " Although it has several modes, the Jumbo mode seems to be most useful"}
{"source": " Played through a carefully EQ'd amp, you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings"}
{"source": " There is an audible hiss, less noticeable plugged direct into PA, noticeable plugged into a good, clean tube amp, out of control with humbuckers or solid states"}
{"source": "The key to using this pedal is using it correctly"}
{"source": "First and foremost: use single coils"}
{"source": " Tested with a Les Paul with Burstbucker Pro's, the hiss was overwhelming"}
{"source": " Played with an American Deluxe Strat with N3 Noiseless pups in the 3rd position, it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel"}
{"source": "Point two - any form of gain will create a ton of hiss"}
{"source": "Point three - tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps (tested through a Frontman 212 and Vox Pathfinder vs an Orange Tiny Terror and Fender HRD)"}
{"source": "The AC3 is not a set it and forget it pedal"}
{"source": " Based on the volume of the amp and the room you're in, you will need to tweek the EQ to find that tone"}
{"source": " I've read that you can use an EQ pedal to get the same tones, I haven't found that to be the case"}
{"source": " If your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch, or in my case as the only guitar player, to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly, this is a great fit"}
{"source": "-2 stars for ever present  hiss, +3 for actually sounding like an acoustic when it's EQ'd correctly"}
{"source": "SummaryAcoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways"}
{"source": " I returned it"}
{"source": " Price seems high for what it is and vs"}
{"source": " alternatives in the marketplace"}
{"source": "Pros- Boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9V power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs"}
{"source": "- variety of acoustic sounds possible"}
{"source": " (personally, I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)Cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- While I have several Boss pedals, I think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small"}
{"source": " I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing"}
{"source": "Details:The basic concept is good"}
{"source": " I had an AC-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note"}
{"source": " It wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it"}
{"source": " It was also just noisy in the pedal chain"}
{"source": " Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some"}
{"source": " However, I sold that model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound"}
{"source": " At the time, the AC-2's were selling for about $85 new"}
{"source": " Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC-3"}
{"source": "I bought the AC-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC-2 -- and they did, a little"}
{"source": " But not enough to keep it"}
{"source": " I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced"}
{"source": " I think the AC-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great"}
{"source": "I opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead"}
{"source": " They make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;"}
{"source": " The 400 has reverb on the pedal"}
{"source": " I opted for the 300 and got it for $25"}
{"source": " I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case"}
{"source": " However, this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Boss"}
{"source": "if it breaks"}
{"source": "I'll just buy another"}
{"source": "I also have a Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit"}
{"source": " You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC-3"}
{"source": " The least cost effective of those choices is the AC-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have"}
{"source": "I'm not saying its a bad pedal, I'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model"}
{"source": " If they would fix the noise issues, I might have even kept it"}
{"source": " I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times I'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect"}
{"source": " This Boss pedal just didn't work that well for me"}
{"source": "As with all Boss / Roland products, the Boss FS-6 performs as designed"}
{"source": " I purchased it to control both my Boss ME 20 Multi effects pedal and my Fender Blues Jr amp"}
{"source": " The A switch (in non latching mode) allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my ME 20 and the B switch (in latching mode) allows me engage and disengage the FAT (overdrive) switch on my Blues Jr Amp"}
{"source": " Everything works exactly as planned"}
{"source": " The FS-6 rugged, compact (fits right into my into ME 20 carrying case) and easy to use"}
{"source": "I read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries"}
{"source": "something to complain about"}
{"source": " As with most guitar players I don't use batteries in my effects pedals I use an 9 volt AC/DC adapter"}
{"source": " Visual Sound offers the \"One Spot\" AC/DC adapter kit that has a 9 volt battery snap connector adapter"}
{"source": " I removed the battery cover, then using a small rat tail file I carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through"}
{"source": " I then put rubber feet (purchased at ACE Hardware) on the bottom to allow the snap connector cable"}
{"source": "battery problem solved"}
{"source": "I also use the FS-6 as a sustain pedal for my Yamaha YPG 225 portable grand piano and a control for my RC-3 Loop Station simultaneously"}
{"source": " The possibilities are limited only to your imagination"}
{"source": " It is somewhat expensive but it is a Great Product!! If you need a duel switch then I highly recommend purchasing the FS-6"}
{"source": "If you are fan of the Jazz III you will definitely like the Ultex version"}
{"source": "  From my experience, the Ultex has the sound and feel of Tortex but without the \"memory\" aka wear"}
{"source": "  The Ultex is thicker than the standard nylong Jazz III's and only when directly compared will you notice that the Ultex version has a slightly larger gripping surface"}
{"source": "Five stars for being a better Jazz III"}
{"source": "  However, the prices for these on amazon are absurd"}
{"source": "  I got mine through musiciansfriend for around $2 shipped"}

{"source": " I decided to try them out"}

{"source": "Meaning I didn't really feel like there was a problem other than me, being that problem"}
{"source": " Then I read about this new Ultex thingyit looked like a jazz III and every one seemed to like it"}
{"source": "sooo I figured why not have a go at it"}
{"source": " I was skeptical about this &#34;impossible to drop&#34; thing which I read"}
{"source": "so i was dieing to feel them"}
{"source": " Well they came"}
{"source": " i tried them and after playing for a while I didn't even notice that I hadn't once readjusted my pick"}
{"source": " NOT ONCE "}
{"source": " it was like there was no pick"}
{"source": " i started paying closer attn and more and more i realized that this thing really is what its hyped up to be"}
{"source": " it stays there"}
{"source": " to me that's just freaking incredible! holy @#$@%# wow! I love this thing love it love it!"}
{"source": "I bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an Aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar"}
{"source": " The difference is quite noticeable and good"}
{"source": " The guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a \"better than a lot more expensive guitars\" sound"}
{"source": " I had a bone nut that cracked which is why I tried these replacements"}
{"source": " In my estimation the sound is clearer, brighter and louder"}
{"source": " The price seemed high for a little chunk of \"plastic\" but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied"}
{"source": "When I purchased this I'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar"}
{"source": " Guess what? As far as I can tell, there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with"}
{"source": " This is NOT worth the money"}
{"source": "I selected this to replace the cheap plastic Saddle that came on my Fender acoustic"}
{"source": " This was a tremendous upgrade and made a difference in the tone and 'brightness' of the sound"}
{"source": " This was easy to install and comes with easy to understand instructions"}
{"source": "Having recently purchased an Epiphone EL-00 I went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to Graph Tech's Tusq material"}
{"source": " It is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with"}
{"source": " The top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the Tusq bridge and pins, the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional"}
{"source": " This was one of the best modifications I have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments"}
{"source": " I have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade"}
{"source": "I can barely wait"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice"}
{"source": "Got to admit I was a little intimidated by the installation process when I was shopping for this pickup"}
{"source": "  But when I got the box I was pleasantly suprised to find excellent instructions (not too long, not too short) along with plenty of supplies to complete the instillation properly"}
{"source": "  The jig method is super easy and provided great results"}
{"source": "  I was really excited to try out the pickup so I plugged it into my Roland AC-33 and let her rip, it was awsome, very full and very representative of my guitars sound"}
{"source": "  K&K you have a convert in me"}
{"source": "  I am now thinking about trying this on my Martin!"}
{"source": "So based on the reviews from Amazon, and a friend who swears by these pickups, I decided to put one into my 310 Taylor"}
{"source": "I am extremely pleased!  This was my brother's guitar, and he had a Mcyntire soundboard transducer installed by his local guitar shop"}
{"source": "  It sounded terrible"}
{"source": "  I tried messing with placement to get it to sound better, but it just didn't sound good, had tons of feedback, and just didn't have a good feel"}
{"source": "I installed this pickup myself"}
{"source": "  I have installed a few pickups in a few different guitars, and this one was pretty painless"}
{"source": "I didn't have to drill out the endpin hole, so it only took me about 20 minutes to install this bad boy"}
{"source": "When I tested it out I was blown away"}
{"source": "  It sounded beautiful!  Just like my Taylor, only louder!The true test was an actual live performance"}
{"source": "  I brought my Baggs Para Acoustic D"}
{"source": "I"}
{"source": " and I was glad I did"}
{"source": "I was able to adjust the EQ just a tad, cut some of the mid-range a bit, and it sounded even better!I could not believe it"}
{"source": "  It literally gave me chills"}
{"source": "If you're on the fence about this pickup, go for it!  The reviews don't lie, this sounds fantastic, especially if you can EQ it a bit"}
{"source": "I did plug in without the PADI, just to test it and it still sounded good"}
{"source": "  If I forgot my PADI I would have no qualms about playing this straight into a system"}
{"source": "  It might be labeled as passive, but it's got the volume of an active system for sure!It's a great buy in my opinion"}
{"source": "This pick-up sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically"}
{"source": "  It does pick up percussive noise which you don't get with under saddle pickups"}
{"source": "  It is prone to feedback in very loud situations if you don't use a sound hole cover"}
{"source": "  Over all I'm please because I was able to install myself and it was simple"}
{"source": "  You do need to use an external pre-amp, but even with piezo pick-ups that is usually the norm"}
{"source": "  The directions that comes with the pickup are very thorough and the company is helpful if you have questions"}
{"source": "  The only change I had to make to my guitar was making the end pin jack bigger and that was easy too"}
{"source": "Disapointed"}
{"source": " The sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound"}
{"source": " It sound muffled"}
{"source": " I will have to replace it soon"}
{"source": "I have these in three guitars after trying out some undersaddle and sound hole pickups"}
{"source": " Some peope miss the &#34;quack&#34; ,electric guitar type sound from these other types"}
{"source": " I do not"}
{"source": " I also like that the bridge and saddle do not have to be modified ,nor is any battery required"}

{"source": "I own two Hercules GS302B stands for my electric guitars, and I couldn't be happier with them"}
{"source": " When I needed an acoustic stand I turned to the Hercules GS301B and have no regrets"}
{"source": " At the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars"}
{"source": " Not only do stands have to hold guitars securely, they shouldn't harm the finishes of the instrument"}
{"source": " Unfortunately many stands will harm the nitrocellulose lacquer on many higher-end guitars; since I have two guitars of this nature, protecting them was of the utmost import to me"}
{"source": " Fortunately these stands protect most nitrocellulose finishes, and I have never had problems with mine"}
{"source": " The stands themselves (both varieties) fold up to be very compact if you need portability, and support the guitar very securely"}
{"source": " I don't gig with these guitars, so portability was not paramount to me, but stability was: these stands are extremely stable and are very sturdy (mine reside on a carpeted floor, and I have never had any issues with them tipping over"}
{"source": ") Some people may not love the yellow and black \"bumble bee\" coloration, but I actually find it whimsically industrial"}
{"source": " I am completely happy with all three of my Hercules stands: they are safe, portable, rugged, and won't hurt the finish on most guitars"}
{"source": " If I need another guitar stand, it's a good bet I will buy another Hercules"}
{"source": "This thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand"}
{"source": "  Of course one might think that would translate into sturdy, and one would be correct"}
{"source": "  Super simple to use"}
{"source": "  No buttons, levers, or knobs"}
{"source": " Just pop it open"}
{"source": "  It doesn't have an actual mechanical locking feature, but the design is such that if you fully open the outside legs they will basically lock in place"}
{"source": "  It holds my acoustic securely, and I have no fear that it's going to tip over on its own"}
{"source": "  When you're done, just nudge the outer legs to \"unlock\" them and it's super easy to fold back up"}
{"source": "I had a Fender mini acoustic stand, but it didn't fold flat enough to fit nicely in my gig bag so I figured I would try this one"}
{"source": "  I am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter"}
{"source": "  HOWEVER"}
{"source": " I can only give it four stars because when folded the three back feet stack up and give it about a 2"}
{"source": "75\" thickness"}
{"source": "  If Hercules could have figured a way to avoid that, this baby would truly fold as flat as a magazine"}
{"source": "  It's still pretty flat and takes up less room in my bag, but I think the Marketing guys used a little creative license with that description"}
{"source": "  (Either that or they're comparing it to the Cosmo year end recap issue"}
{"source": ") Still a great little stand and I would buy it again if needed"}
{"source": "I was previously using a Rocksmith USB Cable, but wanted a specific cable for my iMac"}
{"source": " This unit definitely fits the bill, and from what I can hear when playing, has an even lower latency than the RS cable"}
{"source": " I was getting a little unwanted slapback with the RS cable, but this unit seems to have taken care of that"}
{"source": " It's also quite nice to have a headphone jack right up front for quiet practice times"}
{"source": "The software that comes with this Interface is a joke, and is about as useful as an AOL disc"}
{"source": " Since I use Logic Pro X and MainStage 3 it wasn't a loss to me, but if you are buying this interface for the fact it comes with &#34;Amp Tones&#34;, you might want to look somewhere else"}
{"source": " I couldn't even get the software to load on my 2013 iMac"}
{"source": "This product has turned out to be great with few exceptions"}
{"source": "  It comes with three amplifier software packages and says you have the license to turn on any one of the three, not true"}
{"source": "  The license included only works for one amp, the AC box combo and not the other two, you need to purchase the license for them"}
{"source": "  Plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor"}
{"source": "  You cannot run the output through your sound card to your PC speakers due to latency"}
{"source": "  You must use the headphone jack on the interface"}
{"source": "  In addition if you are in an austere environment and can't get to the internet to register your product immediately you are out of luck trying to make it work"}
{"source": "  Once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product"}
{"source": "I use this to practice at my computer to keep from disturbing my wife when she is studying or my daughter when she is sleeping"}
{"source": " Great little box!"}
{"source": "I ordered this so I could plug my guitar into my computer and record music"}

{"source": " Quality German manufacturing as always"}
{"source": " Nice"}

{"source": "The Behringer UCG102 device is an aging (yet affordable) piece of hardware that offers the intriguing option of plugging your guitar directly into the USB port of a computer"}
{"source": "  This opens up a number of possibilities for recording or simply for playing with headphones"}
{"source": "  For the budget player, it could be argued that a mere $32 investment unlocks a world of free amp modeling and recording possibilities"}
{"source": "However, while the actual hardware is compact and seems function properly, there are some significant problems here"}
{"source": "  First and foremost, there is the problem of getting the device to work, getting the software to recognize it, and configuring it to run without significant \"latency\" (which is a delay effect where you don't hear a played note immediately when it's played, which can make monitoring anywhere from frustrating to impossible)"}
{"source": "  The UCG102 runs on an ASIO driver"}
{"source": "  They include an older version with the software, and you can snoop around online and find other options"}
{"source": "  But that doesn't mean it will necessarily work with your software, or work well if it does"}
{"source": "  For example, Audacity is a popular \"freeware\" program you can use to record and mix audio files on the computer"}
{"source": "  I've been told that Audacity doesn't work with ASIO drivers, and when I got it to record, the latency issues rendered it unusable"}
{"source": "You do receive two other software options with the device"}
{"source": "  The first is energyXT2, which I believe includes a license for the compact version"}
{"source": "  In theory, this program should work like Audacity and contains a number of amp models and effects, in addition to drum and bass track loops"}
{"source": "  However, I have had little luck figuring out how to monitor and record with this program"}
{"source": "  I'm sure it CAN work, but if you need a computer science degree to figure it out, that's really not ideal for a budget product"}
{"source": "The second item is a trial disc with Guitar Combos by Native Instruments"}
{"source": "  So far, this has been the most impressive of the options offered"}
{"source": "  You can demo three different amp simulators (Vox, Fender, and Marshall) and then enter a code to unlock one of the three"}
{"source": "  I like that it gives you an interface similar to a real guitar amp, which allows you to dial in some realistic tones"}
{"source": "  It's also the only program I've been able to get the headphone jack to play through both ears in (there are problems with recognizing mono vs"}
{"source": " stereo)"}
{"source": "  I adjusted the sound quality to get latency down to 8 miliseconds, which is just into the range where I don't notice it as a problem"}
{"source": "  Still, while the models sound good, I'm not sure how often I would bother plugging into my computer just to do basic playing and recording"}
{"source": "Shortly after ordering this device, I discovered that my sound card has a blue \"line in\" audio jack on the back"}
{"source": "  By running a simple 1/8\" to 1/4\" audio cable from my pedal board to the sound card, I can do direct recording, which is monitored through my computer speakers (no latency) and sounds great"}
{"source": "  Even better, this method works through Audacity and allows me to record and layer tracks"}
{"source": "  If the UCG102 worked as advertised, it would be a more convenient way of doing this, but I simply can't recommend it for most people"}
{"source": "  I feel like there's \"4-star\" potential somewhere in this device, but I doubt I'll ever have the patience to unlock it"}
{"source": "  3 stars"}

{"source": "  I would not recommend buying a 5 footer unless you practice in a closet"}
{"source": "5 feet is a weird length for a cable"}

{"source": " The shorter the cable, the better for studio use"}
{"source": " It reduces signal travel time and potential for interference (though these cables are shielded so the latter concern is moot)"}
{"source": " If you need a longer cable, buy a longer cable"}
{"source": " Don't buy what is advertised as 5' cable and then write a negative review when you really needed a 15' cable"}
{"source": "Bought two for a shockingly low price that I couldn't beat anywhere- even at double the price"}
{"source": " Quality cable, sturdy  user serviceable connectors, well constructed, and 6 months of daily use with no issues"}
{"source": " What more can you ask for?"}
{"source": "I've purchased several of these in different lengths and styles and never had a problem but this one is giving me some minor difficulties with connection"}
{"source": "  Like a loose connection"}
{"source": "The low-E tuner on my 1985 LP Standard broke about a week ago - the back came off and the tuning handle popped out"}
{"source": " I never liked the ones that were on it but I didn't want to drop the $$$ unless I needed to"}
{"source": " I came across these Grovers"}
{"source": " They had good reviews and the price was right"}
{"source": "Took me about 30 minutes to replace all the tuners and re-string the guitar"}
{"source": " The tuners fit perfectly with no modification whatsoever"}
{"source": " They also feel more sturdy than the ones I just replaced"}
{"source": " It's hard to say if they keep a tune better at this point as I haven't had them on for long enough - they *seem* better, though, as the B string with the old tuners used to always go flat quickly"}
{"source": "I decided to use the old screws instead of the new ones that shipped with these Grovers - they fit better (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " tighter)"}
{"source": " Nothing wrong with the new screws, I just like my stuff to be snug"}
{"source": " :)I like them and glad I purchased them - so far"}
{"source": "I installed these on my 2000-ish Epiphone Les Paul"}
{"source": "  They provide a VERY noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look"}
{"source": "  I can tune with much finer precision, and they hold that tuning with even the nastiest of bending"}
{"source": "  The ability to accurately tune and keep that tuning allows to play and sound better"}
{"source": "  I should note that I had to drill new holes or, more precisely, enlarge the holes on my guitar"}
{"source": "  I used a 3/8 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully"}
{"source": "  I'm sure the idea of drilling your guitar might sound scary, but it was actually quite easy"}
{"source": "  Now they are in there nice and snug since I made the holes a bit tight"}
{"source": "I've tried pretty much every harp out there, after having played the regional blues & jazz circuit for about 10 years"}
{"source": "  Lee Oskar harps are the best value"}
{"source": "On top of it, Lee Oskar actually called me once just because I left a question on his website!I've met Rick Epping (of Hohner harmonicas) at NAMM -great guy- but he never called me at 3:30 in the afternoon just because I could not identify a song I thought he was playing on!I carry around between 10 or 12 harps to a gig, so that is at least $290 for a set of Lee Oksar harps"}
{"source": "10 Suzuki Manji harps, while nice and the phosphor bronze reeds are great, would cost nearly $480 - presuming you could find them"}
{"source": "I will not say I've never blown a reed on a LO, but I will say that $22 for a new set of LO reed plates beats $48 for a new Manji, at least in my book"}
{"source": "On top of it, all they really did with the Manji is discontinue the \"Bushman Delta Frost\" harmonicas and rename them so they could double the price"}
{"source": "Lee Oskar harmonicas are inexpensive, they are simple and cheap to repair, easy to play, have great tone, and are even easy to identify since the 1st & 2nd position keys are printed right on the comb"}
{"source": "  That feature is great for beginners who might not be able to keep them straight yet"}
{"source": "Give them a shot"}
{"source": "I bought this and a Hohner Special 20 key of C harp to test them both out"}
{"source": " This harp is a great harp, pretty much the exact same as the Hohner Special 20 in overall quality"}
{"source": " \"Feels\" a little more airtight, brighter and louder than the hohner, but in side-by-side testing the effect is diminished"}
{"source": "The Hohner Special 20 just seems to have this little extra"}
{"source": "expression to it"}
{"source": " More life or something"}
{"source": "Both harps very bendable, etc"}
{"source": " Real high quality"}
{"source": "As for the replaceable reed plates"}
{"source": "Amazon has this harp marked down to about the $25 level"}
{"source": " Reed plate replacements are about $19"}
{"source": " Now I realize that at retail that's half the price of a RETAIL harp, but only $6 less than a \"whole new harp\" otherwise"}
{"source": "With this in mind, I would generally recommend beginners start with the Hohner Special 20"}
{"source": " Just a slightly better or at least more fun-sounding and fun to play harp with a little more animation and expression available \"free\", in my opinion"}
{"source": "My son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in Europe during WW I"}
{"source": " Needless to say, I did not want to pass this on to him yet"}
{"source": " I figured he could start simpler"}
{"source": " I read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument"}
{"source": " It has a great tone"}
{"source": " Its construction is solid"}
{"source": " I am sure this will give him years of entertainment"}
{"source": " This is not a toy - a great addition to your mouth harp collection"}
{"source": "I'm a guitarist with a passion for blues, so it was only a matter of time before I was going to pick up the harmonica"}
{"source": "  I almost went with some of the cheaper options, but I am extremely pleased with my decision"}
{"source": "  It sounds gorgeous (very full and clear), and I've already been able to start bending some notes--which I understand I notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas"}
{"source": "As a blues guitarist I was tempted to buy a harmonica in D or A that, when played in second-position, would allow me to play along with blues songs in A or E (two of the most common blues keys; especially among the songs I like to play)"}
{"source": "  The second-position for the harp in C is G (not terribly common)"}
{"source": "  However, I think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in C, since many of the beginner songs are in C, and the C major scale should be very familiar to most musicians"}
{"source": "  In other words, as I'm exploring the notes, they make a lot of sense to me"}
{"source": "  At this price, I won't mind buying a D or A when the time comes--it's not like I'm already at a level where I'm dying to play those songs anyway"}
{"source": "  And, if I need to, there are a couple of songs I've found in G (e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": ", Work Song by Butterfield)"}
{"source": "  That song along should keep my practicing for a long time"}
{"source": "  If you are still reading this review, then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp, add it to your cart"}
{"source": "Good quality for the price, It's a mic on a stand"}
{"source": " Plug it into an amp, computer sound card, karaoke machine, whatever, and belt out your favorite tune"}
{"source": " Is this the most bestest sounding microphone on the planet? No, my friend"}
{"source": " It is not"}
{"source": " Sorry"}
{"source": " But it is perfectly adequate for most purposes"}
{"source": " The stand that comes with is light and I wouldn't subject it to too much abuse (don't invite Iggy Pop over, he's rough on mic stands) but it will do the job admirably if what you want is something to hold the mic while you wave your hands in the air like you don't care"}
{"source": " And you're gonna do that, right?"}
{"source": "Good quality for the price"}
{"source": " It exceeded my expectations"}
{"source": "  I expected something a bit more flimsy, but was surprised to find it as heavy duty as it is"}
{"source": "I feel that every microphone is great compare to nothing"}
{"source": " It works great thank you, Nady and Amazon"}
{"source": " It's compact and great to use"}
{"source": "This low cost, compact microphone and stand is perfect for my local speaking engagements"}
{"source": "  I connect it to my portable 20 watt amp and provides the sound I need in intimate settings"}
{"source": "  The stand is surprisingly stable and good quality"}
{"source": "These aren't the dirt-cheap - these actually have some nicer connectors - mid-grade level"}
{"source": " They aren't the cheap type with a rubber boot that pretends to be a strain-relief - these are screw on plastic bits with a more sturdy housing"}
{"source": " Decent cables and aren't too expensive"}
{"source": " Will buy again"}
{"source": "I needed a few extra cables this year for a few live sound events"}
{"source": " For the price point I was worried about buying \"cheap cables\""}
{"source": " This are a great value for your buck"}
{"source": " The only thing I didn't like about these"}
{"source": " the cable ties suck! haha"}
{"source": " If you need some quality \"cheap\" cable, these are for you!"}
{"source": "I wouldn't consider this a $30 backup mic, I would consider this a professional vocal mic"}
{"source": "  Period"}
{"source": "  This is a great mic!  Out of the box, it has a nice weight to it"}
{"source": "  It sounds slightly hotter than say, a Shure SM58; which is why I like it so much"}
{"source": "  I typically like to stand back from a mic when I sing live and this seems to work very well for my vocals with that technique"}
{"source": "  I have also tested this mic with harmonica as well"}
{"source": "  Seriously"}
{"source": " I don't work for the company or have any ties whatsoever"}
{"source": "  I'm just a dude in a band"}
{"source": "  Trust me on this one"}
{"source": "Yes this ie every bit as good as the Shure SM 58 but you don't get the cool pouch"}
{"source": " The 57 version is also like its Shure counterpart"}
{"source": " Great sound and great deal"}
{"source": " (yes I am a musician too)"}
{"source": "I was very skeptical about this mic being so cheap and all but I use it in my band with several other Shure mics and I cant tell the difference the same pa mix and they sound the same"}
{"source": "I plan on getting a few more of these"}
{"source": "Ha, Amazon rejected my first review because I mentioned a competitor by name (chickens)"}
{"source": " Let's just say that the price is excellent, much better than the competition, and the cables work great"}
{"source": "  How's that?"}
{"source": "I am a pro drummer and run pro sound support PA systems for outside venues as well from time to time"}
{"source": " It is essential that I have cables that carry the great sound we make out to the speakers to reproduce it acurately to the crowds"}
{"source": " These 50 ft xlr cables are made well, I hear virtually no sound loss or distortion over the long lengths"}
{"source": " And as usual dealing with GLS and Orange County, they came fast packed well and safe"}
{"source": " I am a continuing returning customer because of quality, price and service"}
{"source": " And though on this particular order I had no need to contact them, they checked in with me to make sure everything went well"}
{"source": " Great folks to deal with"}
{"source": "The Good:This is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones"}
{"source": "The Bad:The tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise"}
{"source": "  The cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied"}
{"source": "  The effects are hit and miss as well"}
{"source": "  Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive"}
{"source": "Throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones"}
{"source": "I had a Line 6 POD that worked only on the computer and was great for effects and stuff but not the best for actually practicing away from the computer and decided it was time to change that"}
{"source": " I considered a few different brands and even other Line 6 POD models"}
{"source": " I even ordered a POD XT only to cancel that order when I realized that you can download tones from the Line 6 website and add them into the user memory banks for easy retrieval"}
{"source": "As many have said, the batteries that come with it did not last long at all, but that was kind of expected"}
{"source": " I have since been using Energizers and those are lasting long enough for my needs, plus I have a 9 volt AC adapter that works great, especially when I am recording"}
{"source": "To use it for recording, simply output from the headphone jack to the input on your laptop or desktop computer and you'll be able to record with all the tones you could want! I downloaded a Joe Satriani sound and am so happy with it that I have already recorded myself playing one of his songs with it and it sounds great!I am not going to knock a star off for this since they obvously put a belt clip on it for a reason, but if you are like me and still like to sit it on a desk every now and then, it will not stay put by itself as it is not heavy enough, but I found that you can put two rubber bands on either side of it and it helps it to &#34;grip&#34; better and stay put so that it doesn't slide right off"}
{"source": "I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to any guitarist out there who needs some great tones to practice with"}
{"source": " I don't play live so I cannot say how well it would work for that"}
{"source": "I wanted a portable headphone amp but bought this instead because it was only a few bucks more and offers a ton more features"}
{"source": "  Though it's not perfect, it's like having a room full of guitar effects and different amps"}
{"source": "PROS:  32 amp models, 16 cabinet models, effects + thousands of available presets = TONES GALORE; good software for managing tones and creating new ones; can be used in front of an amp (in case you want to know how a modeled Mesa/Boogie would sound coming out of a real Vox); lots of connectivity; compact enough that I keep the unit, the cable and the power supply in my case; no tech problems at all; built-in noise gate and tuner; easy-to-use tap feature"}
{"source": "CONS:  There's a learning curve and you will need the manual to know stuff like how to change amp models; manual is a pdf file; hard to keep track of preset tones on the unit (though you can rename and re-arrange them with the software); presets based on famous songs don't always sound right; minor background hum; uses 4 AAA's in a few hours and the manual says don't use rechargables (though it doesn't say why); for legal reasons, the unit uses generic amp names (check the manual to match the amp model names to the amps they're based on); with everything plugged in the whole setup becomes a little unwieldy; doesn't sound as nice as a good pedal and a Marshall half stack (no kidding, right?  And I still don't sound like Alvin Lee)"}
{"source": "As an inexpensive effects box that also works as a portable headphone amp, this thing is cool"}
{"source": "  You won't get bored with it but you will need to learn how to use it"}
{"source": "  Master some of the amp/cab models and how to tweak them for gain, reverb, delay, etc"}
{"source": " before you dive into the presets"}
{"source": "  And once you've got the presets you like best, use the software to put them all in one place so you can find them easily"}
{"source": "The Line 6 Pocket Pod Pack includes a patch cord, power supply, USB cable, CD, cheap ear buds, and MP3 player cable"}
{"source": "  The Pack is 150 new, so if you're going to buy the power supply then just get the Pack"}
{"source": "  If you buy used then the manual describes how to do a factory reset so it's like new again"}
{"source": "Like many guitar players, I have a few effects pedals of different brands and I needed an alternative to nine volt batteries to power them"}
{"source": " At one of the guitar forums I frequent I started a thread about powering a TS9 Tube Screamer with a non-proprietary nine volt power supply, One Spot came back twice in the replies"}
{"source": " Since that time I acquired a two more pedals so now I really needed something"}
{"source": " I looked into powered pedal boards but decent boards were too expensive and too bulky me"}
{"source": " I got creative, I ordered a One Spot Combo Pack then bought some 2\" wide industrial strength Velcro and built my own board that fits in my hard-shell brief case"}
{"source": "So far so good, after two months of band practices the One Spot 9V DC adapter with the Multi Plug daisy chain cable does what I bought it for, my little four pedal setup works beautifully"}
{"source": " I'm perfectly happy it"}
{"source": " The One Spot adapter is well made and the cable is ten feet long so it should be long enough to reach your stage power source"}
{"source": " The Combo Pack also includes protective caps for the unused plugs on the Multi Plug daisy chain"}
{"source": "If you are thinking about buying this product, do it"}
{"source": " If you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals, here is a compatibility chart"}
{"source": "["}
{"source": "]Power to the pedals, Rock On!!!!"}
{"source": "This seems like a good product"}
{"source": " It is working well for me and the chord is super long which is great"}
{"source": " Too long is better than too short!!"}
{"source": "Ive Been Using This Item For about 3 weeks now, and I love it"}
{"source": " I Have a homemade pedalboard, the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board"}
{"source": " I power 7 pedals and Absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up, If anything it sounds better than a battery, FOR SURE"}
{"source": "I'd read a lot about the One Spot power system"}
{"source": "  I needed 220V power overseas and so I ordered this"}
{"source": "  It is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet"}
{"source": "  I currently have some high end power bricks on my two larger pedal boards"}
{"source": "I may swamp them out fo this one"}
{"source": "  Highly Recommend it"}
{"source": "Granted this is no voodoo laps pedal power, or another isolated power supply, but it does provide clean, quiet daisy chain power for up to 8 pedals, and does so pretty dang great for $150+ cheaper"}
{"source": "Is it silent? No"}
{"source": "Is it reliable? Yes"}
{"source": "Would I use it on stage or in the studio? Yes"}
{"source": "Would I prefer something nicer if $$$ weren't an issue? Yes"}
{"source": "Does this wok great on a budget, absolutely!!If you're tired of using batteries pick this thing up!If you're a super quiet signal chain snob, save an extra $150 and get the voodoo labs"}
{"source": "Versus the Godlyke, I'd say this is the better purchase"}
{"source": " Though the Godlyke product claims 2000mA of power (2amps), this is slighlty less at 1"}
{"source": "7mA (1700mA or 1"}
{"source": "7amps)"}
{"source": " Anyway, if your drawing that much juice using your pedal board, you may want to re-consider what you are using"}
{"source": " The product itself is plastic, but seems solid, I believe it will hold up to repeated use no problem"}
{"source": " Being plastic though, you do have to be careful not to drop it or have it stepped on or rolled over, etc"}
{"source": " I do like the fact that it does have a heavier gauge wire than the Godlyke product and seems slimmer so it will fit more readily into '1 spot' as advertised"}
{"source": " The heavier wire means that when someone rolls in their 4x12 cab your power supply cable will have a higher chance of survival"}
{"source": " The extender that comes with is good, seems about as generic in length and space between connections as you can get"}
{"source": " I only wish it came with two of them"}
{"source": " I am using a Pedaltrain Pro board and at 32"}
{"source": "9 inches, it will require a pair of the extensions to get to all the pedals"}
{"source": " The combo pack also includes some other adapters for those odd pedals that refuse to conform and use 1/8\" power connections, some 9 volt adapters for pedals with out any external power"}
{"source": " One thing I have not checked yet is the actual output of the supply"}
{"source": " A lot of companies think that if their voltage is 'close' to 9 volts, thats good enough"}
{"source": " The reality is that this is an indication of poor quality control and lack of intrest in producing a quality product"}
{"source": " You will find some higher end devices specifically warn NOT to use anything higher than 9 volts so 9"}
{"source": "6 volts isn't 'close enough'"}
{"source": " Anyway, while I have not checked the output of the adapter yet, I did fire it up on all the pedals I could power with the one extension that came with and everything worked nice and quiet"}
{"source": " It is amazing how having a good quality power source can help eliminate some buzz and other 'noise' from your signal chain"}
{"source": " I'd buy this again and in fact I may buy another just as a back up"}
{"source": " It is a tad pricey at thirty bucks"}
{"source": " feels more like a twenty five dollar item given the all plastic construction but, all in all, a good buy over the competition"}
{"source": "It's a good ideal but the big problem I have is if Ya are using a tube Amp"}
{"source": " ( have a 65' Twin Reverb Fender tube ) Ya get one HELL of a HUM"}
{"source": " It's so bad I just can't use it at all"}
{"source": " I'm not sure about a transistor Amp"}
{"source": " but who uses those ????"}
{"source": "I was new to pedal effects, new to pedal boards, and new to the challenge of how to power it all"}
{"source": "  I did my research and settled on Pedal Train for the board (the Mini, with case) and the One Spot for power"}
{"source": "  This bundle--including an 8-pedal chain, a few adapters and the power supply--does it all"}
{"source": "  In fact, it may be overkill"}
{"source": "  I only have 5 pedals, so I have to hide/secure the rest of the chain with twist ties"}
{"source": "  And the adapters, never used 'em"}
{"source": "  But it is a complete kit"}
{"source": "  If you need more than this, I don't know what to tell ya"}
{"source": "I have been trying to find a good vibrato pedal for a long time"}
{"source": " I have bought $150 pedals and $100 pedals and I got this one for $25 and it blows all the others out of the water"}
{"source": " The only down side to this pedal is that you either need to run it off a 9volt or the Behringer power supply"}
{"source": " I couldn't get it to work properly with my pedalboard power or my Pyle-Pro PPDLP02 DC supply"}
{"source": " The plastic case feels like it may break at anytime but aside from that I love this pedal more than a puppy playing a harp in the middle of a daisy field in Michigan"}
{"source": "I've been wanting a pitch vibrato pedal for a while but didn't want to spend $350-$500 for an old boss vb-2(which this pedal sounds exactly like) so i looked at this which I didn't really know what to expect but when I got it I was amazed by it, it sounds really good"}
{"source": " It maybe less durable than a metal pedal but who cares for this price I wouldn't mind buying a new one if mine broke and considering there is hardly any companies that actually make pitch vibrato's(uni-vibe/Vibe pedals are not pitch vibrato pedals)buying a new one isn't a problem"}
{"source": "SUMMARYGreat pedal, buy it, you'll probably keep it! At its price point - 5 stars"}
{"source": " I am keeping it and it is probably going to become a permanant addition to my pedalboard"}
{"source": " Only time will tell but I like adding some vibrato for clean sounds"}
{"source": " It reminds me a lot of how I used to set up my Super Reverb amp"}
{"source": " Compared to all pedals, I'd actually give it 4 stars - downgrading 1 star for the plastic case and the limited functionality of the Rise control"}
{"source": " But I liked it so much I decided to score it \"at its price point\""}
{"source": "PROS- dirt cheap at $25 for a new pedal- sounds great - does not add or subtract any frequencies or add any noise (I wish I could say the same for some $200 pedals I've tried"}
{"source": ")- Latched/Unlatched mode -- the best feature on the pedal"}
{"source": " I love that I can put this in unlatched mode and use it to vibrato in short bursts"}
{"source": "- Small form factor - normal \"single pedal\" size- Standard power supply - 9V Center negative - runs from pedal board power or a battery- The larger foot pedal surface (compared to just a silver bullet switch) is nice for the unlatched mode useCONS- Cheap plastic case - I doubt its durability and would have preferred to pay more for a more durable case"}
{"source": "- Latched/unlatched switch is small (hard to reach, have to bend over, can't do with a toe)- Rise control has only the most subtle impact on sound"}
{"source": " Probably not needed on this pedal"}
{"source": " Two larger controls for the other controls would be a better design for usability"}
{"source": "- Like most pedals - the knobs are super small and not easily controlled with a toe, and the settings are hard to see"}
{"source": " My favorite pedals have large knobs, well marked settings you can see from a distance, enough space between the knobs to set one without bumping another, and in the best cases, enough space, size, and durability for the knobs to be tweakable by a foot or toe bump"}
{"source": "Suggested Redesign, \"Super Vibrato\" or \"Vibrato II\"1) Change to a metal case2) Lose the Rise control altogether3) put the latched/unlatched modes on a 2nd stomp switch so you can stomp to go between modes4) Increase the size of and space between the other two controls -- put large \"foot controllable\" knobs with high visibility knobs"}
{"source": "Then again, at 25 bucks, I might just buy a 2nd one and put one in latched and one in unlatched mode"}
{"source": "I've used the FX600 for a couple of years"}
{"source": "  I've got a pedal board, with several pedals, but if I had to take only one pedal with me, (and I often do, when I have to travel lite), this is the pedal I take"}
{"source": "  Not only do I get a full selection of effects, but the pedal doubles as a DI unit, solving input issues on some problem sound systems I've played thru"}
{"source": "  That's probably an unintended benefit, but I find it a valuable feature, which gives me confidence to play thru any system"}
{"source": "  FYI, my buddy's Digitech multi-effect pedal actually introduces hum into systems, where this (FX600) has helped me get a cleaner sound"}
{"source": "  While this unit has no tone adjustments, it also adds 'something' to make my guitars sound better (I know that is sort of vague)"}
{"source": "  The only down side of this pedal that I have found is that, because they have jammed so much stuff into one pedal, it is a little hard to make precise adjustments"}
{"source": "  But, with what this pedal DOES do for me, that's a small price to pay"}
{"source": "  For this price, I can't see why anyone would not like this pedal"}
{"source": "I ordered this pedal based on the previous review, but to me it sounds cheap and faint"}
{"source": " I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price, but this one I won't be keeping"}
{"source": " To me, it wasn't even close to as good as what you get on Fender amps or on my TC Electronics Delay pedal (which includes chorus/vibrato), and I thought that I would go solo with this pedal, but for me it's a no go"}
{"source": "I've been playing for about 17 years"}
{"source": "  Most on my playing is with a bluegrass band here in Columbus, Ga"}
{"source": "  My performance guitar is a Martin HD-28 and my practice guitar is a Blueridge BR-180"}

{"source": "  Nice, real nice guitar"}
{"source": "I found that the action on this S6 is pretty good out of the box"}
{"source": "  I'm going to take it to my luthier tomorrow and have him install a strap pin/peg on the heel and take a look at the action at the same time, if he can make the action better, I'll let him"}
{"source": "  I'm also going to put on some Elixir Light strings"}
{"source": "  I don't know what kind of strings are on it out of the box"}

{"source": "You won't regret it"}
{"source": "Seagull guitars have intrigued me for years in photos and on their website, but there is no dealer anywhere near me, so I bought one sight-unseen from Amazon, based on the good reviews"}

{"source": "  The narrow, reverse-taper headstock and wide fingerboard give this guitar a bottom-heavy look when viewed vertically"}
{"source": " Back and sides are cherry with only a light stain, and the binding is dark"}
{"source": " The top is natural cedar"}
{"source": "As dreadnoughts go, this one is very comfortable to play sitting down"}
{"source": " It appears to be based on the Martin outline, but with a slightly rounder lower bout and a narrower upper bout"}
{"source": " Weight is pleasantly light, and the semi-gloss finish is comfortable to the touch"}
{"source": " Players with broad fingers will appreciate the wide fingerboard, but those with small hands should consider the \"\"Slim\" version, with a neck 0"}
{"source": "08\" narrower at the nut"}
{"source": "Sound is what really counts, however, and this Canadian dreadnought has nothing to be ashamed of there"}
{"source": " The maker has the good sense to ship the instrument with high-quality, fresh strings, allowing the new owner to appreciate the notable bass and clear midrange as soon as it is tuned up"}
{"source": " Overall, it falls within the classic dreadnought tone category, with good volume"}
{"source": "Buying a guitar online saves money but leaves setup to the buyer"}
{"source": " Both the nut and saddle on my guitar needed lowering, and the truss rod required adjustment (a long-reach hex wrench is included)"}
{"source": " If you are not experienced in these tasks, a local luthier should do it for no more than $30 or so"}
{"source": "Based on sound, playability once adjusted, and construction quality, this guitar should definitely be included when comparing instruments in this price range"}
{"source": " It is a real standout in value"}
{"source": "Update 8 DEC 2012: The more I play this guitar, the more I love it"}
{"source": " It delivers balanced sound with good dreadnought \"snap\", and once the action was dialed in, the broad fingerboard relieves finger crowding I didn't fully realize hindered my playing"}
{"source": " I am considerng replacing my Takamine mini-jumbo with a Seagull equivalent"}
{"source": "Although not through Amazon"}
{"source": "com, I recently purchased a Seagull S6 Original acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " I compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range, as well as with the Seagull Entourage acoustic-electric which was also in the general price range"}
{"source": "  The S6 has a nicely consistent tone which, although maybe a little too bright for some players' tastes, projects very well"}
{"source": "  Some reviewers and guitarists with whom I've talked wonder how Seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in North America for the price"}
{"source": "  I think that I found part of the answer when I looked inside some of the Seagulls"}
{"source": "  The braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars"}
{"source": "  Looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it, though, you'd never know"}
{"source": "  I find the 1"}
{"source": "8\" neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and left-hand fingering"}
{"source": "  It's a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width"}
{"source": "  For me, it works"}
{"source": "  Some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar"}
{"source": "  Seagull does offer other models, by the way, that have a more traditional width"}
{"source": "  The slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale Gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models:  just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering, but not so short as to cause floppy strings"}
{"source": "  I couldn't be happier with the Seagull S6, especially for the price!"}
{"source": "I heard great things about the S6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, I bought it based upon reviews"}
{"source": " I've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- The Seagull is comparatively unattractive"}
{"source": " Its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar"}
{"source": "- The cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice"}
{"source": "- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing"}
{"source": "- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr"}
{"source": "- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition"}
{"source": "- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy"}
{"source": "- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK"}
{"source": "- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I've not encountered before"}
{"source": "- I can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes"}
{"source": " In fact, for the price range, I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, Sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good"}
{"source": "I don't regret getting it, but I feel like I overpaid for what I received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price"}
{"source": " Seagull to me is over-hyped"}
{"source": "Thanks for reading!"}
{"source": "I personally think this Seagull is over rated"}
{"source": " A lot of reviewers are covering the muddy (not crisp) sound as &#34;mellow&#34;I don't think so"}
{"source": "  I have over 115 guitars in my collection, and around 15 of them are acoustics"}
{"source": "I have nothing against Seagull, or Canada, but bought one of these NEW off the rave reviews, and just recently (I have had both theS6 and FGX730 for five years) pulled the S6 out for another try just because I could not make myself believe it sounded worse thanmy used Yamaha; IT DID!Side by side I went through the chords on each guitar, and had to finally come to the conclusion that the Seagull had to go"}
{"source": "With a price tag of $420"}
{"source": "00 for the S6, and $282"}
{"source": "00 for it's Yamaha equal, the FG730S, unless you just feel like throwing yourmoney away, I would stay away from this guitar, and look elsewhere"}
{"source": "Oh, by the way, I have an S6 for sale!"}
{"source": "I bought this guitar in 2005"}
{"source": "  It sounds and looks wonderful and manages to stay that way"}
{"source": "  I think this is a good guitar and when you think that something that might sound better would cost three to four times as much it is a great guitar for the value"}
{"source": "This model has the cedar top"}
{"source": "  I love that sound vs the more typical spruce top on flattop guitars"}
{"source": "  It is a bit more mellow and has a hint of a classical guitar tone because of that"}
{"source": "  If you prefer the bright concert sound of a Martin then you'll not want this cedar top"}
{"source": "Yes this guitar has an oiled finish"}
{"source": "  This allows the soundboard to really sing unimpeded"}
{"source": "  It also allows you to knock the heck out of it"}
{"source": "  Funny thing is that after five years there isn't much damage just a little arm wear"}
{"source": "  I think you'll like this guitar enough to not knock it around"}
{"source": "The neck feels silky smooth"}
{"source": "  The frets are well placed and don't stab you by hanging over the neck a little which is what you'll get in other guitars in this price range"}
{"source": "  Paying to get the frets filed down is an additional expense on those competitors so beware when comparing"}
{"source": "This doesn't come with a case so I bought a hard shell by the brand name \"Canadian\""}
{"source": "  Great case"}
{"source": "When I bought it it really didn't need an adjustment but I took it to a local shop to make it perfect for me"}
{"source": "  I've also taken it in every other year for setting the action - checking and tweaking the neck - and getting the frets polished"}
{"source": "  I also use a humidifier in its case during the winter months in Chicago"}
{"source": "  Performing these tasks will prolong the life of your Seagull and your enjoyment of it"}
{"source": "--------------------Update: 10/13/2012 update of my 2010 review"}
{"source": "  This guitar sounds even BETTER"}
{"source": "  I went to a handful of guitar stores looking for another acoustic \"just for fun\" and I had a few bucks burning a hole in my pocket"}
{"source": "  To my surprise all the guitars three times its price sounded vastly inferior"}
{"source": "  You see I learned that as you play a good wood guitar that over time it will \"open up\" and keep sounding better"}
{"source": "  Yet another reason to keep it humidified and taken care of"}
{"source": "  It will increase in value (to you at least)"}
{"source": "This 7 band eg"}
{"source": " is a great way to change the sound of your guitar"}
{"source": " It has more flexability than just a tone knob"}
{"source": " It's easy way to get scooped metal or just fine tune the sound of you amp and guitar"}
{"source": " Highly recomended!"}
{"source": "I've had this pedal since the mid-90's, when I started playing in my teens"}
{"source": "  While an EQ might seem like an odd choice for a beginner's pedal selection, I was mainly trying to compensate for the crappy bass and mid-range of the cheap CRATE and Marshall amps I used back then"}
{"source": "  Since I have better equipment now, I haven't used it as much"}
{"source": "However, as simple as it is, it is definitely a useful tool"}
{"source": "  You can leave it on all the time to mold your sound with greater detail than most amps would have with knobs"}
{"source": "  Or, you can the on-board volume to crank up the volume for solos or louder parts"}
{"source": "The only negatives I recall from using it were that it added a bit of a hissing noise (but not so much that you couldn't trap it with a noise gate), and it seemed to take away from the sustain of notes just a bit"}
{"source": "  Again, nothing that can't be fixed with other effects"}
{"source": "  And if you think about how important equalization is with stereo equipment, it only makes sense that you might want that level of control in a guitar amp as well"}
{"source": "I give it 5* despite the minor flaws because it does what it says and BOSS products are built rock solid"}
{"source": "  I'll have this thing forever"}
{"source": "It has Great sound and distorts like its suppose to"}
{"source": "I have been needing one for A long time"}
{"source": "Thanks Beringer USA"}
{"source": "So many tones to choose from with the variable frequency Eq and a nice range of distortion makes this a killer deal"}
{"source": "Don't let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you"}
{"source": " This is an awesome pedal"}
{"source": " Ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound"}
{"source": " It is made of a tough plastic and as long as you don't abuse it to much it should be fine"}
{"source": " You can adjust all range of sound and make it yours"}
{"source": " As the title states I love the sound and I also love the price"}
{"source": " Buy this!"}
{"source": "I have purchased various lengths of these GLS cable to patch my rack equipment"}
{"source": " They are well made, reliable and cost effective"}
{"source": " The XLR connectors are secure and I couldn't purchase the cable and connectors and build them for less"}
{"source": " The colors make it easy to identify the patches quickly especially in dim light"}
{"source": "This came today and I must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly"}
{"source": " My Takamine acoustic/electric fits perfectly and is VERY STABLE on the stand"}
{"source": " I have 100% confidence this will NEVER tip over on its own"}
{"source": " You'd have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over"}
{"source": " Anyone with less than 4 or 5 stars must be a paid shill"}
{"source": "This is built like a tank and should last a lifetime"}
{"source": " It is adjustable (the neck) fully padded, and the two-arm base piece swivels for a custom fit"}
{"source": " The stand takes 30 seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport"}
{"source": " A+++++++++++++"}
{"source": "It's a stand, it does what it's supposed too?  That being said, I try not to use stands as they are extremely unreliable"}
{"source": "  I use these to put my instrument down for a short time only"}
{"source": "  These are by far some of the better made ones I've found without a contraption to &#34;lock in&#34; my instrument and give a false sense of security"}
{"source": "  These are made no where near how they used to be 20 years ago, in a negative way, but the foam/ medical piping has gotten better as the old stuff used to scuff and deteriorate really quickly"}
{"source": "  I'd prefer a better stand, however, I question it's existence"}
{"source": "This OnStage \"Heavy Duty Guitar Stand\" is exactly what we were looking for to hold my son's acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " Here are my observations:+ Easy to Setup; takes just a few seconds+ Sturdy; free standing design works well+ Neck Retainer; adds a degree of protection from accidental knocksThis is a great basic stand that works exactly like we hoped!Highly Recommended!CFH"}
{"source": "This stand was very inexpensive and I thought I could save a bit of money and give it a try for use with my Epi Sheraton II"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately I am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand"}
{"source": "  It seems to be built well enough for what it is, but it seems quite unbalanced and always on the verge of tipping backwards"}
{"source": " Also, for left/right stability you need to set the guitar just so in the bottom support piece or it seems 'tippy'"}
{"source": "The construction itself is 'ok'"}
{"source": " The rubber tips on the feet seem fine, but the front legs seem overly long with the rear foot overly short"}
{"source": "  The body cradle is nicely padded but isn't firmly seated inside the center tube and even though it has a rudimentary locking design, it just isn't all that solid"}
{"source": "  You can adjust the height but just inserting the top piece into the bottom caused deep scratches in the black paint of the top tube piece"}
{"source": "  It ships with an unsightly white UPC sticker which must be tediously removed if you want it to look good onstage"}
{"source": "Granted, the Sheraton II is a large and heavy guitar but the OnStage is billed as \"Heavy Duty\" and to me that means SOLID, which this stand just isn't, at least with larger guitars or basses"}
{"source": "  When you use a guitar stand you can't afford to be dealing with something that is in the least bit temperamental or you risk damaging your instrument and possibly even your livelihood"}
{"source": "Bottom line, you get what you pay for"}
{"source": " For smaller, lighter guitars, Strats and such, it may be ok, but for Dots, Sheratons, 335's and larger Gretch's, I just wouldn't trust it and that goes for most basses as well"}
{"source": "I will need to look for something else"}
{"source": "The construction of this set is superb"}
{"source": " The ends have heavy duty strain reliefs, and the XLR connectors are well made and perfectly mate with receptacles on the devices being patched"}
{"source": "Probably the biggest plus is the cable itself, which appears to be heavy gauge - certainly thicker than my other patch sets - and built to last"}
{"source": "In addition, I love the attention to detail in the form of color coding, which makes tracing cables behind the rack a lot easier"}
{"source": "I have patch cables from different brands and this set does stand out for its quality when compared to the others"}
{"source": " And the price is so close to the more generic ones that I have been using that I am switching over to this brand for my future needs"}
{"source": "I am no audio file, but these do the job and I like the colors"}
{"source": "I did buy some more expensive Magami ones and I can't tell a difference"}
{"source": "*Incredible quality and value"}
{"source": "These cables are high quality in every respect and are much better than I expected for the price"}
{"source": "They use heavy duty wire and insulation, and are well constructed"}
{"source": " They employ quality connectors, and have strain reliefs on each end"}
{"source": "The dual velcro ties are another indication of the quality of these cables, and the color coding is a big plus as well"}
{"source": "Not only is the product outstanding, but I was contacted by the seller after the purchase to make sure I was happy with the cable set"}
{"source": "I am so pleased with this purchase that I am a customer for life"}
{"source": "*"}
{"source": "I had purchased this cord and a 25' cord for an assignment I was going on"}
{"source": " I had previously  bought a shorter cord that just didn't fit tight enough into the mic"}
{"source": "  This one and the other one I bought were really a great, well made product and fit the mics tight and as they should"}
{"source": "  I would recommend these cords and will look to purchase other lengths soon"}
{"source": "These cable are perfect!!  I've bought much more expensive cable that didn't have the quality of these"}
{"source": "  They even had velcro (re-useable tape to hold them 2 each)"}
{"source": "I recently bought these for my home studio, so far so good, keyboards to mixer"}
{"source": " They are a little flimsy, but so far no problems, have extras if necessary, high end cables also break down"}
{"source": " They were packaged very good and the cable wraps are a plus"}
{"source": " For the price and selection and results, works for me"}
{"source": "Holy buckets of tone batman!Let me start by saying, I'm always on the quest for great amazing tone"}
{"source": " I think it ends here"}
{"source": " This pedal is absolutely remarkable"}
{"source": " Built like a tank, I'm pretty sure it will out live me"}
{"source": " Its full of sonic options"}
{"source": "The overdrive has a level, tone and overdrive"}
{"source": " Almost self explanatory except the tone is more of a presence knob and less of an EQ which is a total plus in my book"}
{"source": " it also has a mini toggle for comp cut, fm, and vintage modes"}
{"source": " The comp cut is more of a clean boost to push your amps front end, the fm is really transparent, and the vintage mode gets you that creamy midrange bite"}
{"source": "Yes, this may be another tube screamer clone, but it's a darn great one"}
{"source": "The added MOSFET circuitry toggle gives it a lovely growl your low-end fattening it up, if thats your cup of tea, while the standard leaves it more transparent"}
{"source": " You should know this switch does effect the whole signal, not just that of the boost side"}
{"source": "On to my only negative check on this pedal, the boost ONLY works when the OD is on"}
{"source": " It is not a boost to be run in series with the overdrive, just additional circuitry to add more gain to your OD signal"}
{"source": "Another great feature, this pedal can be run at different volts from 9v-18v"}
{"source": "Running at standard 9v gets you easier breakup, whereas 18v will get you more headroom"}
{"source": "This pedal won't be leaving my board, probably ever"}
{"source": " If you're even thinking about it, just do it!!! You'll never regret it"}
{"source": "Ever notice how every youtube video has pedals being demoed with either a Strat or a Tele?  We we can debate why that is but one thing for certain is it is tough to get an accurate idea of what an LP will sound like till after you unbox it"}
{"source": "  After hours of research I decided on the FD2 since it seemed to have a lot of tuning options and I actually found a review using an LP into a clean amp"}
{"source": "["}
{"source": "]Essentially, you get 3 modes which have varing degrees types of OD and a second boost mode to push things even father"}
{"source": "  What I liked about this pedal is you can use the comp cut or flat mids with an LP and not increase the bottom end or mids which often Teles or Strats need"}
{"source": "  Hence, you can go from slight boost to huge gain without turning into mud like some pedals will do"}
{"source": "  The only downside is with so many options you will constantly be playing with the knobs and switches and finding new sounds"}
{"source": "  Works fantastically with modeling amps which need varying amounts of clean and dirty OD depending on what you are modeling"}
{"source": "Guitar bag fit over my Fender T Bucket guitar"}
{"source": " Cheap price and does the job"}
{"source": " It has just enough padding and heavy duty nylon to protect my acoustic from being scratched"}
{"source": " Worth $24"}
{"source": "Haven't used it yet, but it looks nice and came quicker than expected"}
{"source": " So far so good! I recommend it"}
{"source": "ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home \"12/23/11\" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset, i would not returned because i don't feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for"}
{"source": "This bag is made well enough"}
{"source": " If you are careful it offers good protection"}
{"source": " You can't rely on this bag alone if you are going to toss the guitar around and you certainly can't stack anything on it but it will prevent dings and scratches from occasional bumps etc"}
{"source": " If your guitar is priceless than you should upscale your gig bag, otherwise it's a good bag, especially at this price"}
{"source": "Quick and accurate"}
{"source": "  I also like to use the bypass mode as a standby switch for changing guitars"}
{"source": "  Doesnt register notes well with both pickups engaged though"}
{"source": "If you are like me that you love playing music, this is a good buy"}
{"source": " It pretty much does what it's supposed to"}
{"source": " So, you plug it and it's ready to use"}
{"source": " It's pretty fast, and accurate for it's price"}
{"source": " Light weight"}
{"source": "The only thing that it takes a little longer is to tune the 6th string"}
{"source": "Overall, it's good enough to buy it"}
{"source": "for musicians in a budget this is the deal, it is not the best but it still does the job"}
{"source": "not very powerful to read the signal of strings in my acoustic guitar as it does the Boss tuner, but for electric or bass is fine"}
{"source": "very accurate too"}
{"source": " just gettit if u are in a budget"}
{"source": "Look at this pedal"}
{"source": "  Look at what it does, and what it costs"}
{"source": "  $30 for a tuner in a pedal form factor, and that's if you don't even try to hunt down a lower price"}
{"source": "  By contrast, Boss's TU-2 is essentially the same thing in a more durable housing, and it costs $100 retail"}
{"source": "Yes, the housing is made of plastic"}
{"source": "  I don't know about you, but I generally won't be leaping with both feet onto my tuner in the middle of a set"}
{"source": "  If you treat your gear with any respect whatsoever, it should survive"}
{"source": "  And if it doesn't, so what?  It's cheap to replace"}
{"source": "The other person on here obviously got a faulty model, which happens"}
{"source": "  Mine's developed a touchy input jack over time (it's actually the earlier TU-100 model), but I don't know that it's totally unexpected on a pedal this cheap"}
{"source": "  One star off for these kinds of quality control problems, just to be fair"}
{"source": "  I own three other Behringer pedals as well, and they're still going strong"}
{"source": "A tuner is an essential part of any musician's rig, and this does the job just fine"}
{"source": "  Use the money you save towards buying a really nice stompbox that will actually affect your sound while playing"}
{"source": "UPDATE: After having used a new tuning pedal for some time, I will admit that, yes, this is a subpar tuner"}
{"source": "  However, I still stand by my original opinion that for the amount of money you pay, this isn't a bad investment"}
{"source": "  For a guitarist just starting out, this would still make a good first tuner when you really want to spend your money on pedals that will affect your sound"}
{"source": "This is not a gigging pedal"}
{"source": " You do not have time to tune with this pedal at a gig, so if you're planning on gigging in the next month or so spend the $50 on a Korg"}
{"source": " However if you're an at-home player who just wants to not have to mess around with regular electric tuners, this is worth the price"}
{"source": " It sits right on the pedal board, the signal flies through it when it's off so there's no monkeying with your cables everytime you want to switch between standard and Drop D, and it's as accurate as the Korg is"}
{"source": " It's just also slow"}
{"source": " It takes a good 2-3 seconds to register a change, which is fine when you're just practicing or even for recording at home where a few seconds aren't crucial"}
{"source": " I just recommend something a little faster if you need to tune quickly between songs"}
{"source": "Not bad at all, this unit tunes really well, same as the Boss original, the only difference is that this one takes like 1 sec to respond after the pedal is activated, the Boss is instantaneous, other than that both units behave exactly the same"}
{"source": " Some criticize this brand for making cheap clones but the truth is that they are making musicians on a budget a great favor, for those of you who do not want to spend $100 on a tuner this one is just perfect; since I am a collector I have other brands to compare (Boss, Korg, Fender"}
{"source": ") and it is the same thing, it is as accurate as the Boss , at least mine is, and is a good mute switch also, I am happy with mine"}
{"source": "thing works fine"}
{"source": " easy to understand settings "}
{"source": "sturdy enough"}
{"source": " lights nice an bright"}
{"source": " i like it"}
{"source": "use with power supply and not batteries"}
{"source": "works best"}
{"source": "These pedals are great!! A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals aren't manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them"}
{"source": " I have increased my speed a lot since I've gotten em and I can pedal songs like \"All Nightmare Long\" and \"Beast and the Harlot\" now  =]  great pedals"}
{"source": " BUT, it takes time to develop speed so don't think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can't go all Jason Costa on em"}
{"source": "When I purchased this pedal from a local music store I wasn't even looking for a double pedal set, but for a replacement for the pedal that came with my Tama Stagestar kit"}
{"source": "  During my quest for a pedal that had the feel I wanted I sat behind a Pacific drum kit that had these pedals"}
{"source": " At first I ignored the second bass pedal and played a bit with just the right pedal and hi-hat"}
{"source": "  I liked the feel of the right pedal and was about to ask if the store had it in a single pedal configuration when I decided to see what it was like playing double"}
{"source": " Wow - it immediately expanded my range and opened up a plethora of possibilities"}
{"source": "This pedal is nearly infinitely adjustable, especially cam rotation, spring tension, and beater offset"}
{"source": "  Most of the adjustments require a hex wrench, which is fairly standard for most modern single and double pedals"}
{"source": " The left side slave pedal has a full floorplate, and the linkage rod that connects the right and left pedals will not bind at any angle I have tried"}
{"source": "  There is a slight lag on the left pedal, which is normal for any double pedal configuration, but you'll quickly compensate for that as you get used to a double pedal if you are moving from a single pedal"}
{"source": "Before I purchased this particular model I tried out Tama's Iron Cobra, Pearl's Powershifter and a Gilbralter Avenger"}
{"source": "  I did not like the stiffness of the Iron Cobra, but did like the Pearl and Gibraltar pedals"}
{"source": "  It finally came down to either this or the Gibralter, which was slightly smoother, but significantly more expensive"}
{"source": "  I opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this pedal"}
{"source": "If you are moving from a single to double pedal configuration I strongly recommend that you give this one a serious look"}
{"source": "  More importantly, try out this pedal in a local store and compare it to other double models - selecting a bass pedal is a personal decision with many more factors than price, features and quality"}
{"source": "  It has to feel right"}
{"source": "  In addition, you will find that you will be using the double bass more than your hi-hat, which means that you will need to compensate"}
{"source": "  For that I recommend the Gibraltar hi-hat drop clutch (ASIN B0002F73YY), which will allow you to engage and disengage your hi-hat with ease"}
{"source": "  I have my hi-hats set for a slight opening in the normal closed position, but stepping on the hi-hat pedal - using the clutch - puts it in full play position"}
{"source": "  Tapping the lever on the clutch closes them again"}
{"source": "  This clutch is a perfect companion to a double bass pedal!"}
{"source": "Excellent stomp box"}
{"source": " You can dial it right in to get that SRV sound"}
{"source": " Very sturdy and very well made"}
{"source": " A must have for any blues player"}
{"source": "If you need a tube screamer"}
{"source": " You can't go wrong with the TS9"}
{"source": " The only reason why you shouldn't get it, is if it isn't the right tone for you"}
{"source": " I say this because you can't say anything bad about this pedal"}
{"source": " It sounds amazing"}
{"source": " It just might not be your sound"}
{"source": " I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9"}
{"source": " People who say this is better than the TS808 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording"}
{"source": " They prefer it"}
{"source": " It's not better"}
{"source": " Both are great"}
{"source": "First off, this is a great, classic pedal that has shaped the tones of rock and blues artists all over the musical map"}
{"source": "  It's actually a reissue of the pedals Ibanez made in the 1980's, though there's some debate over whether or not  the modern circuitry retains all of that original tone"}
{"source": "  In my opinion, unless you're being purposefully picky or have the most elite of trained ears, you would never be able to tell the difference"}
{"source": "  The construction is sturdy (metal and actually heavier-feeling than a BOSS pedal)"}
{"source": "  The LED light, for some reason, is difficult to see from an angle, but that's largely an irrelevant gripe"}
{"source": "But let's be clear what a \"Tube Overdrive\" pedal is and isn't"}
{"source": "  This is NOT a distortion petal like the Boss DS-1 or Metal Zone (MT-2)"}
{"source": "  It is also not a \"fuzz\" pedal like you would hear on a Jimi Hendrix song"}
{"source": "  It is not meant for heavy rock/metal/grunge type music"}
{"source": "  If you need heavy distortion to mask sloppy playing, the TS9 is not for you"}
{"source": "What it DOES do, however, is to boost the signal at the front end, which essentially results in a more dynamic done with additional gain"}
{"source": "  This can result in a very midrange-heavy \"blues\" tone (Stevie Ray Vaughan used it quite a bit), or even a nice \"crunch\" overdrive tone (AC/DC) for rhythm work"}
{"source": "  Some guitars use it simply to boost their signal without adding a bunch of additional gain"}
{"source": "  It also works well with other distortion pedals for that purpose"}
{"source": "Long story short - the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer really is one of the more versatile pedals you will use - just don't expect it to create every range of sounds you need right out of the box"}
{"source": "  For a cheaper alternative, consider Digitech's surprisingly good \"Bad Monkey\" overdrive pedal, which is half the price and gives you more control over tone"}
{"source": "  I've also compared this to BOSS's BD-2 Blues Driver, which is an excellent, but very different style of overdrive"}
{"source": "  (The BD-2 has a much hotter output and is more aggressive; the Tubescreamer is more subtle and works in the midrange while retaining your underlying clean tone and responding to picking style)"}
{"source": "  If you start with a good amp and guitar setup, the Tubescreamer will sound great"}
{"source": "  It won't completely transform your tone, but it will give your current tones a boost, make those solos really sing and those rhythm chords really crunch"}
{"source": "I bought this unit for a friend, and I could compare with others overdrives I already have"}
{"source": " I think the MXR Badass Custom Modified Overdrive or Way Huge Green Rhino are better choise"}
{"source": "I've owned a TS808 since I purchased it used in the 80s for around $20"}
{"source": "  Yes, this is a great overdrive"}
{"source": "  This pedal has many famous users and it has been used on many iconic recordings"}
{"source": "  Pair this with a strat and run it into an amp on the verge of breakup - now you're in tone heaven"}
{"source": "  But the plain truth is this:  there are tons of pedals out there now that do what this does - and they do it for a fraction of the cost of the 808 reissue"}
{"source": "  This was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives"}
{"source": "  I own a boatload of other dirt boxes and while this one is iconic it's not the most transparent or versatile"}
{"source": " There is a 'mid hump' in the EQ of this pedal that either sits well with what you are playing or it doesn't"}
{"source": "  I'm glad I own mine but I don't think I'd shell out what they are charging these days for the reissue"}
{"source": "  If I am not mistaken both the TS9 and the TS7 can be modded to this circuit with less than 25 cents in parts and about 15 minutes of your time"}
{"source": "  If this pedal came in under the $100 mark it would be more deserving of five stars"}
{"source": "  I really hate to burst anyone's bubble but SRV's tone was really in his fingers"}
{"source": "  And so is yours ;)"}
{"source": "Years ago I owned an original edition TS808; I loved that pedal and used it for years on stage"}
{"source": "  Eventually I sold it many years later, but I always missed that pedal, so I decided to give this reissue a try"}
{"source": " My verdict: Awesome - It sounds just like I remember"}
{"source": " The TS808 just has that 'certain something' that really brings out a nice smooth overdrive sound, especially when it's to enhance the overdrive sound you may already have"}
{"source": "I have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but I hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers"}
{"source": " It really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound"}
{"source": " This pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts"}
{"source": " This pedal has three preamp settings: Ts9, Hot, +, and Turbo"}
{"source": " It's great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar"}
{"source": " One nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings"}
{"source": " For example: if you set on the \"Turbo\" setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely"}
{"source": " If you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound"}
{"source": " If you want a metal sound, then I recommend the Metal Zone by Boss/Roland"}
{"source": "BOSS MT-2 Metal Zone Overdrive Distortion Pedal"}
{"source": "To start, as the full name of this pedal would indicate, this pedal is for tube amps"}
{"source": " I can't comment on how it'll sound for a hybrid, and my experience is that it's definitely not for solid state"}
{"source": " Distortion pedals go much better with solid state"}
{"source": " Further, tube screamers aren't meant to take your tube amp from clean to high gain; again, that's what a distortion pedal will do"}
{"source": " Tube screamers in general are designed to drive your tubes a little harder,and are most commonly used as a solo boost"}
{"source": " Tube screamers are in the category of \"overdrive\" pedals, and like the name would indicate, they're meant add a little extra \"over\" an already \"driven\" amp, but in a more natural, smooth, organic way then a distortion pedal would"}
{"source": "HOWEVER, the Ibanez TS-9dx does more than your typical tube screamer"}
{"source": " The extra knob that switches between ts9, +, hot, and turbo mode adds a whole lot of tone and use options"}
{"source": " Let me expound:I play hard rock and metal through a Bugera 1990 head (basically a Marshall JCM 900)and cab with celestion vintage 30 speakers"}
{"source": " While that amp does have a fair amount of gain and bass on tap, it's not quite enough to accurately get more modern tones unaided"}
{"source": " A standard Ibanez TS-9 or some other knock-off tube screamer will not be able to get an amp like mine into more modern, heavier tones, because standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass and add some mids, again, to help solos cut through the mix"}
{"source": " But the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem"}
{"source": " By switching to +, hot, or turbo mode, the pedal adds bass and a little extra gain incrementally"}
{"source": " I like the \"+\" setting the best"}
{"source": " So the way I use this pedal is that I'll set my amp for my standard crunchy rhythm tone with the gain on the amp already fairly high"}
{"source": " Then, for the songs that utilize a little heavier sound, I'll kick on my ts9dx, with the drive pretty low (9 o'clock), volume at 12 o'clock, tone about 1 o'clock, and + mode"}
{"source": " With these settings it increases the bass and general thickness of my tone, and adds a little gain and volume"}
{"source": " So it's basically like adding another channel to my amp"}
{"source": "I will add one detail that might make or break this pedal for you: tubescreamers in general, and certainly this Ibanez ts-9dx, add mid-range to your tone automatically"}
{"source": " And you can't dial it out"}
{"source": " The regular ts-9 mode adds some low mids, and a little more high mids"}
{"source": " The other modes add more low mids in particular, which in part contribute to the overall \"thickness\" to the tone, which can be great"}
{"source": " But if you're after a scooped mid sound, say for metal, then I would only recommend this pedal as a solo boost, where the mids will help cut through the mix"}
{"source": "In conclusion, it's probably safe to say that most people who buy tubescreamers are probably playing blues of some sort and are just looking to boost their volume and maybe add a little dirt"}
{"source": " And yes, this pedal will do that"}
{"source": " So will the BBE greenscreamer, behringer tube overdrive,mxr distortion plus, Boss SD-1, digitech bad monkey, or several other ibanez tube screamer pedal variations"}
{"source": " But by adding the turbo-mode options, the Ibanez TS-9dx will work for the hard rock and metal players (depending on the exact style) in a way that these plethora of other options won't"}
{"source": "Consider the distortion sound of Cream, the Doors, and ZZ top"}
{"source": "  That buzzy, psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately, that's about all it does"}
{"source": "  However, if you want to have the perfect \"break on through\" guitar intro sound, this is absolutely the pedal for you"}
{"source": "  Quality-wise it's awesome, and if I needed that sound I would definitely own one again"}
{"source": "  I got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions, and honestly I haven't missed it, because I'm not in a Doors cover band or anything"}
{"source": "If you're not familiar with EHX's signature distortion/fuzz pedal the Big Muff, please go to a guitar shop somewhere and try one out"}
{"source": "  Describing its sound with words helps, but doesn't really do it justice"}
{"source": "  It definitely owns its own sonic territory and after playing through one for a while you'll see why so many guitarists of so many fields have one on hand"}
{"source": "They're one of my very favorite effects, honestly"}
{"source": "  So for this review, I'm going to focus more on how the Little Big Muff stacks up against the other models"}
{"source": "For starters, this version takes care of ALL of the common complaints regarding the NYC reissue"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": "  Its true bypass"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": "  Its much smaller (not super tiny like a Boss, but a little slimmer than, say, the wider MXR pedals like the Phase 100)"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": "  It uses a normal 9v adapter jack (thank you, finally!)"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": "  It sounds better"}
{"source": "Yes, it indeed SOUNDS better than the NY Reissue"}
{"source": "  Some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has"}
{"source": "  This one is smoother"}
{"source": "  Not as creamy as the Russians, but it also doesn't suck tone like that one does either"}
{"source": "  Its a touch higher gain than both the Russians and the Tone Wicker versions, but all in all it absolutely is a Big Muff"}
{"source": "So if you're in the market for one of these, and you don't want the options the Tone Wicker Muff provides, this is absolutely where its at"}
{"source": "  Its better in every way than the NY Reissue"}
{"source": "Also, it costs less money! Yay!"}
{"source": "This is a well built, and high quality product"}
{"source": " It provides great sustain and distortion"}
{"source": " If you're on a budget, but still want professional sound; this product is what you're looking for"}
{"source": "The Little Big Muff does one thing spectacularly well: it delivers massive fuzz-plus-sustain"}
{"source": " For that purpose, it's excellent, both in sound and construction (it feels like a metal brick)"}
{"source": " However, be warned: if you're looking for a standard \"distortion pedal,\" this is not it"}
{"source": " It's a fuzz pedal"}
{"source": " It delivers ferocious fuzz but is not a general purpose distortion pedal (like, say, a BOSS DS-1)"}
{"source": " If a great fuzz pedal is what you want, this is a superb choice--and, so far as I know, the best one for its price"}
{"source": " If the price is still too much for you, consider the ModTone Fuzzer, which is about as good but substantially cheaper (at least as I write this)"}
{"source": "I own several Electro-Harmonix pedals and overall I like the brand (even though the owner appears to me to be a sexist pig clown boy in many of his YouTube videos)"}
{"source": " Of those I own, two of them are the smaller versions of the GIGANTOR classic E-H pedals, one of them being the Little Big Muff"}
{"source": "First of all, if you have no idea of the difference between fuzz, overdrive, and distortion you should look into it before you buy anything"}
{"source": " These effects are used in different musical styles and produce different sounds, so your choice will depend on what exactly you plan to do"}
{"source": " Do some research by looking on YouTube, looking at Dave Hunter's book on effects, and testing them out at a store"}
{"source": "If you are looking for a basic fuzz box, the Little Big Muff will give you nice sound similar to (if not the same) as that of the Big Muff Pi, depending on the exact year/model you have"}
{"source": " I think the tone is great, but as with most basic fuzz boxes, there are only so many different sounds that you can get out of them"}
{"source": " It is simple to use though, and it makes a lot of noise"}
{"source": "As a bonus, these don't take up a lot of pedalboard space compared to the Big Muff Pi, yet will give the same tone"}
{"source": " It is great for punk, alt rock/grunge, and classic hard rock like Hendrix and Black Sabbath"}
{"source": "I also have a germanium (red) Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini, another good small version of one of the classics, and the Fuzz Face mini that gives you the most low end emphasis of the three (the blue silicon and aqua Hendrix models boost treble more)"}
{"source": " To quickly compare it to the Little Big Muff regarding sound, the Fuzz Face does not have a tone control, but I think it gives a better control over the fuzz saturation"}
{"source": " While the Little Big Muff will give you more control over the tone (EQ), like many EHX pedals it goes from zero to crazy rather quickly"}
{"source": " In this case when you begin turning the Sustain, it is not long before you are in very fuzz saturated zone"}
{"source": " As you increase the amount of saturation, you get more sustain but less control of the dynamics so all your pick attacks begin to sound the same"}
{"source": " So, I'd say while both the red Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini & the Little Big Muff are good tools, each comes with its own disadvantages"}
{"source": "Though some E-H units come with power supply, this one does not and you will need to get one unless you like changing batteries"}
{"source": " Although few pedals come with power supplies, I think its lame not to include them and you will need to factor it into the cost of the unit"}
{"source": "If you are into looking at pretty pedals on your board, then you might be able to find a prettier fuzz box than the stark and dreary industrial-looking Little Big Muff"}
{"source": " I like pretty things, but the sound of this unit is too good to pass up and it is a great tool to have in your kit"}
{"source": "Bottom line:(1) Gives the classic Big Muff fuzz sound(2) Does not eat up pedalboard space like the old GIGANTOR models(3) Noisy (not always in a good way) when on, but has true bypass when off(4) Has tone control (EQ), but the \"Sustain\" saturates very quickly so you get less fuzz control (limits dynamic control of your picking)(4) Simple to use, but limited sound palette(5) Decent price, but power supply sold separately(6) Bleak appearance (not shiny, colorful, or sparkly)"}
{"source": "It's a cool pedal, especially considering it's price, but don't be fooled"}
{"source": " All this pedal does is perform volume swells"}
{"source": " Any other sound you are able to create with this pedal, you wouldn't JUST be using this pedal"}
{"source": " Think of it as a supplumentary effect"}
{"source": " If you want to really get cool sounds with this pedal, you need to use it in combination with other effects; Reverse delay, wah, distortion, etc"}
{"source": "It's convenient too, if you are playing and you want use volume swells, but you also want to use other effects like wah, whammy, something else that requires the attention of your feet"}
{"source": " If you get the settings right you can just click this effect on and it will take care of the swells"}
{"source": " I would say thats probably the best part about the pedal and the biggest reason to get it"}
{"source": " Pure convenience"}
{"source": "It has it's quirks though, If you set the sensitivity all the way at minimum it drastically cuts down your sustain"}
{"source": " To the point where its non-existent"}
{"source": " But the purpose of having the dial set like that is so that you can play loud and fast and still have the effect behave properly"}
{"source": " If sensitivity is increased to say halfway and you try to play loud and fast, the volume effect will only occur on the first note struck"}
{"source": " the rest will just play as if the effect was off"}
{"source": "Other than that, its built well, doesnt add any hiss"}
{"source": " no noticeable signal loss, other than if the sensitivity is at min"}
{"source": " The battery compartment is a pain to get to thats for sure"}
{"source": " power adapters are your friend"}
{"source": "It's cheap, its convenient"}
{"source": " But i wouldn't recommend it for someone who is more into metal or fast and loud styles of play because that pretty much renders this pedal useless"}
{"source": " especially since that style usually results in moments where you want to hit and sustain a note in the middle of playing hard and fast"}
{"source": " that type of thing will make this pedal a useless hunk of plastic and circuitry"}
{"source": " Oh that reminds me, the casing is plastic"}
{"source": ":-/"}
{"source": "I bought this effect because I saw a few YouTube demos that made it look pretty good"}
{"source": " I had always wanted an attack delay effect and the Behringer Slow Motion was priced well below all competitors"}
{"source": " When it arrived, I tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope"}
{"source": " It only works well under these circumstances: All notes must be played slowly, individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in"}
{"source": " You can't play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly"}
{"source": " Having said that, I found that the effect is nice, once you have mastered the technique"}
{"source": " I tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all"}
{"source": " Other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal, which I have not tried"}
{"source": " I considered returning the unit to Amazon for a refund, but I don't think that would be fair as it DOES work to some extent and it didn't cost me a lot of money in the first place"}
{"source": " However, I do not think I would recommend it to a friend"}
{"source": "It was Not what I wanted"}
{"source": " When A Person has a low Income We can Not afford what We can Not use"}
{"source": " I was looking for what Is called Shimmer most Reverbs do Not have Shimmer as the RV600 Because Digitech called Shimmer, String Swell and Volume Swell Is linked to the Violin Sound It cost Me 30"}
{"source": "00 Its called Slow Motion for a reason because It has to be played slow to hear the effect the only way to hear It Is with Over Drive being played on the high Strings"}
{"source": " It might be good for playing with a Bow, I have No Idea because I can Not afford a Bow"}
{"source": "I've never really owned a fuzz pedal before, but have tried a few"}
{"source": " Out of most I've tried, I've come across the Big Muff the most"}
{"source": " It didn't really strike me as a good flavor of distortion to have until recently"}
{"source": " Even my Boss Hyper Metal HM-3 is considered by some to be a fuzz pedal by some folks, but it isn't 100% there, certainly"}
{"source": "My budget being what is it right now, I didn't want to spend a lot for a fuzz pedal"}
{"source": " There are loads of fuzzes available for $100 or less, but this model is essentially three pedals in one"}
{"source": " That's what attracted me to it, along with a few reviews in YouTube"}
{"source": " Not to mention the bargain basement price"}
{"source": "The three modes can be accessed via a switch on the right side of this pedal"}
{"source": " The two fuzz modes (in my view) don't perfectly emulate any one pedal, but are extremely useful nonetheless"}
{"source": "FUZZ 1 is a creamy, midrange filled sound"}
{"source": " It doesn't get too bright, until the TREBLE knob is pushed past 3 o' clock"}
{"source": " This fuzz could make even anemic single coils sound rich and thick"}
{"source": " With humbuckers, it's actually quite clean in silences until the gain is past about 2 o' clock"}
{"source": " I love the way this fuzz sputters when notes and chords decay"}
{"source": " It seems to work best with power chords (root-5th note), and single notes"}
{"source": " If you play complex chords, you'll hardly notice them; if you try to play them, use as little gain as possible"}
{"source": "FUZZ 2 is more in line with the Big Muff"}
{"source": " It has a scooped midrange, which makes things sound dark and sinister"}
{"source": " With the increased bass and treble, complex chords work slightly better here"}
{"source": " This fuzz also has more sustain than FUZZ 1, so it buzzes longer"}
{"source": " This makes it great to use alongside a guitarist that's using a looser sounding high gain tone that isn't necessarily fuzzy"}
{"source": " (Head era KoRn comes to mind for me"}
{"source": ")The third option is ultimately what made my purchase worthwhile"}
{"source": " BOOST"}
{"source": " This mode is a clean boost with a flat midrange level"}
{"source": " It actually distorts a little, but that's only after cranking the EQ and GAIN knobs all the way up"}
{"source": " The resulting buzz does sound a bit like a slightly overdriven non-master volume amp (or a master volume's clean channel fully cranked)"}
{"source": " Still, throughout most of its gain and volume range, BOOST does a good job of staying clean"}
{"source": " This would be great for pushing an amp into overdrive, or extending the gain of a heavily distorted sound"}
{"source": " It might also be useful for a tiny volume boost for cleaner guitar tones, or just to maintain a stronger signal for a path full of effects"}
{"source": "Overall, I like the tones this pedal spits out"}
{"source": " I've only had it a few hours, but I love what I'm hearing so far"}
{"source": " The build is similar to the other Behringer pedals I have, a NR100 noise reducer, and a TO800, their overdrive that sounds like a Tube Screamer"}
{"source": " With this more recent pedal (built on June of 2010), the knobs seem slightly sturdier than before"}
{"source": " I'd still not abuse them too much, though"}
{"source": " As always, really abusive stompers might want to look elsewhere (or find a way to put the guts inside a custom built tank)"}
{"source": "You can't go wrong with the bright blue LED, either! Makes it easy to see on a dark stage, along with the dayglo orange pedal color"}
{"source": "Buy this"}
{"source": " It's cheap and better than Fuzz pedals that cost 6 times as much"}
{"source": " It can go from a clean boost to a slight octave up fuzz that has to be heard"}
{"source": "Amazing sounds!"}
{"source": "There is such a thing as too much"}
{"source": "  You'll find it in this pedal"}
{"source": "  I have both this and the Boss distortion pedals, and prefer the Boss"}
{"source": "Real good variation from full out (RAT like) to not so much saturation"}
{"source": " The treble and bass control make HUGE sound differences"}
{"source": " Its plastic so dont jump on it! The 1 & 2 ( I dont use the boost but its cool) make it that much more versatile"}
{"source": " You wont be sorry! Almost bought a Big Muff or another RAT but Im glad I spent WAY less money"}
{"source": "I'm an acoustic player, but every once in a while I break out the Strat just to have some fun and get a little variety"}
{"source": "  I wanted to get some of the cool 70s fuzz going just to play around and experiment"}
{"source": "  For me, this pedal was a great way to do that"}
{"source": "With electric guitar, I'm not a tone freak and I don't need everything to sound 100% authentic"}
{"source": "  For me, this pedal gets you 80% of the way there"}
{"source": "  It has two different types of fuzz and plenty of flexible with the controls"}
{"source": "If you're comparing this to $80 Boss fuzz pedal, this one is probaly a lower build quality (e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": " made from plastic), but it's also only $25"}
{"source": "  I'm not taking it gigging or stomping on it in my garage, so I'll gladly take the savings"}
{"source": "None of the problems on/off that plague the Cry Baby"}
{"source": "  Better sound too!  People are sold on that because of its association with Hendrix"}
{"source": "  But THIS is the original, and the best"}
{"source": "  Obligatory"}
{"source": "I just got this and I've noticed that it when I activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone"}
{"source": " I have a crybaby that doesn't have the range the 847 does but its 10x's more transparent"}
{"source": "  There may be other factors at play here as it is new, but the lesson is: try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you"}
{"source": "My hopes for this pad was that it would be soft a sqishy on my shoulder"}
{"source": "  The gel is pretty dense, so it's kind of hard and squishy and very heavy!  I found that it just added more weight"}
{"source": "  I'm not using it"}
{"source": "  I would look elswhere for a different product"}
{"source": "This strap is cool, it is black, made of nice material with gel padding, and it Velcros open and closed so that you can just take it on and off a guitar strap without undoing the strap from the person or the guitar"}
{"source": " Like a clasp it just wraps around the strap and Velcros"}
{"source": " Where I once noticed pressure and chaffing from my nylon strap, now I feel nothing but a heavy pad which puts no pressure on me whatsoever"}
{"source": " Adds about 2 lbs to the weight of your guitar"}
{"source": " Get it if your strap isn't feeling good, other brands work too but you have to thread it through the strap which suckssss"}
{"source": " This one is legit"}
{"source": "After researching overdrive pedals for what seemed like forever, I chose the Fulltone OCD"}
{"source": " The reviews on Amazon helped as well, along with Youtube demos and guitar mags"}
{"source": " What finally made my choice for me was when I found out that Robin Trower used one for his last 2 U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": " tours befor Fulltone made him a sig model"}
{"source": "Okay, this pedal is very versatile for an overdrive"}
{"source": " The HP/LP switch alone gives you a very distinct tone for solos or rhythm, and tweaking the dials adds to the fun (I'm constantly playing with the tones; a minor adjustment makes a huge difference)"}
{"source": " The coolest thing is that this pedal is responsive to your playing dynamics; picking softly dials down the OD, then you can just unleash the crunch with harder attacks"}
{"source": "much better than trying to roll-off the volume"}
{"source": " The true-bypass is great, as you lose no original signal when not engaged"}
{"source": " As of now, this is my favorite piece of gear"}
{"source": "If you're looking for massive distortion, keep looking"}
{"source": " But this will be my 'go to' blues/rock pedal for quite some time"}
{"source": "I have to admit"}
{"source": "  I have not tried this pedal with any other guitar besides my Strats"}
{"source": "  But this pedal gives me everything that I want"}
{"source": "The best way that I can describe the sound of the OCD is Quality and Character"}
{"source": "As a Clean DriveWhen you uses this pedal with less drive as a clean boost for your tube amp, you will notice that it delivers a very strong character from your guitar and is very sensitive to your dynamics while playing"}
{"source": "As an OverdriveI have loved the Ibanez TS9 because it allows a strat to keep a vocal type of midrange while having singing trebles"}
{"source": "  When you add drive to the TS9, it retains those characteristics which is why it is the industry standard for strat guitarists who want to keep their stratty character and get the quality sound of a tube amp"}
{"source": "The reason why the OCD is my preferred pedal over the TS9 is that it does not let the low end distort as early"}
{"source": "  The TS9 allows you lower notes to distort earlier and seems to then amplify the signal"}
{"source": "  The OCD gives you the fattest low end with tons of tone"}
{"source": "  If you like blues or hard rock, you will notice that this feature is exactly what you wanted to give your playing a really strong character"}
{"source": " You gain boldness and when your low end does gain some crunch, it is the biggest baddest tone that you could dream of"}
{"source": "I use this pedal with my HSS strat and through a blues Jr III and use the clean boost for the coolest clean tone ever"}
{"source": "  It allows your playing dynamics to drive the amp, not some arbitrary clipping from your pedal"}
{"source": "  When I am playing heavier blues or rock stuff, I just turn up the drive and have the boldest and highest quality sound that I have ever played with"}
{"source": "The HP/LP switchShifting into HP is almost like a gain boost"}
{"source": "  I have heard it described as switching from an American Fender-y sound (LP) to a British Marshall-y sound (HP)"}
{"source": "  I guess this is a decent description"}
{"source": "  I have found that I get a thick ballsy sound in the LP and I don't lose any quality in the HP"}
{"source": "  It feels like you get a boost in your midrange"}
{"source": "To conclude, I would have to say that this pedal is the perfect mix of ballsy overdrive with quality tone"}
{"source": "  If you have a quality amp and a quality guitar, there is no reason to try and save $30 by buying an Ibanez TS9 or TS808 or TS9dx"}
{"source": "  This pedal will make you a lot happier than those will if you like to keep your low end intact and not allow it to break up too early making it whimpy"}
{"source": "I picked up this pedal used along with DS-1 Keeley modded distortion pedal not entirely knowing what to think"}
{"source": "  Long story short, the mod DS-1 is getting returned and I'm keeping my Fulltone OCD"}
{"source": "First, a word about the negative reviews"}
{"source": "it tells you something when a small handfull of people completely trash something, but the 13 other reviews (as of Sept"}
{"source": " 2012) were all 5-star reviews"}
{"source": " It tells me that the people who ripped on the tone of the pedal didn't know what the pedal was before they tried it"}
{"source": "  And anyone complaining about the price - this is a hand-crafted pedal that is extremely well constructed (the inside circuitry is pristine) and built to last for decades"}
{"source": "  I think the ratings should reflect quality first and foremost"}
{"source": "Now, let's talk about how the pedal sounds!  It's marketed as an overdrive/distortion"}
{"source": "  I had a lot of people try to steer me away from it because I indicated I was looking for a distortion pedal, but I was actually quite surprised at how much gain and sustain the pedal has"}
{"source": "  It is much more an \"overdrive\" in the sense that it keeps the tonal characteristics of your guitar and amp, but boosts the level in gain in a very full, rich sound"}
{"source": "  The sound has a lot of \"bass\" to it, but unlike a Tubescreamer (TS-9), it's definitely not \"muddy\""}
{"source": "  In fact, if you're tired distortion pedals sounding tinny and weak on a combo act, this might be exactly what you need"}
{"source": "The battery is accessible behind 4 hand screws and moderately involved to get to, but an AC adapter is really the way to go"}
{"source": "  It's a standard plug like you find on BOSS and Ibanez pedals, but you can use a 9V or 18V"}
{"source": "  I've read some reviewers say that 18V gives you more headroom, while some actually prefer the 9V sound"}
{"source": "  Honestly, I tried both and didn't discern any difference - it probably only matters at very loud volumes with cabinets"}
{"source": "Finally, there is an LP/HP switch, and it's really a matter of preference and setup how you use it"}
{"source": "  I've been mostly using the LP setting, which has plenty of output but avoids the shrill highs that I hate"}
{"source": "  But in a live setting (or to use it as a boost for soloing), the HP setting could be quite useful, as it is designed the emphasize the mids and highs to \"cut through\" the other instruments on stage"}
{"source": "If I had to summarize this pedal, I would describe it as a Tubescreamer you can rock with"}
{"source": "  Which is not to say that it's \"better\" than the Tubescreamer, necessarily, but it definitely has a larger range of gain and tone"}
{"source": "  Put this on your pedalboard and you may find yourself using it as your go-to for rhythm/chord sections, soloing, or both"}
{"source": "I've never been much of an effect pedal guy; lots of batteries and cables when I can just get a good tone direct into my Fender tweed"}
{"source": " I've recently conceded to using more effects and have gone, quite frankly, hog wild on new gear"}
{"source": " This is the best of the pedal purchases I have made so far, it's not quite the MXR sound I was going for but there's definitely something here"}
{"source": " The boost works very well for lead work and really ups the sustain on my Strat"}
{"source": "Just two controls, one for volume, one for compression"}
{"source": " My only concern is that the knobs feel like they could be much more sturdy, I haven't pulled them off yet but I would guess the pots have plastic posts as opposed to metal ones"}
{"source": "I purchased this compressor pedal kind of on a whim"}
{"source": " I was looking at some nicer ones, and decided to give it a go for only $20"}
{"source": " It came in the mail today, and i was surprised that basic-ness of the packaging"}
{"source": " Very little instructions at all actually"}
{"source": "This DOES NOT ship with a 9 volt battery, and putting one in yourself is kind of a pain to change, as you have to get a philips screwdriver and unscrew 4 corner screws on the back to do so"}
{"source": " (wish there was a plastic back, or thumb screw option)This pedal is really quiet, and not in a good way"}
{"source": "Don't expect to boost your signal level with it, with the makeup gain/output knob all the way up and the sensitivity all the way down, it was about the same volume as the original signal, only a little noisier"}
{"source": "Did not seem to be a tone sucker in the chain/add any noise when off"}
{"source": " Most compressors add a little noise or hiss when on, due to the nature of raising the noise floor"}
{"source": "It also has a SUBSTANTIAL treble boost/low cut going on"}
{"source": " even with the sensitivity knob all the way down, it kills your low end"}
{"source": " It is quite bright sounding"}
{"source": "With that being said, it works wonders on single string/double stop stuff on the already trebley stuff played on the G, B, and E strings, and makes them sound tight and full"}
{"source": "It does seem quite durable, The case isn't made of cheap plastic, which is a good thing"}
{"source": "Though not as rugged as some of the other pedals I would own"}
{"source": "The switch and inputs seem a little cheap though, granted it was a $20 pedal"}
{"source": "I feel using this pedal on tour might be a bad idea, however for home/non daily-use i could see it lasting a while"}
{"source": "The LED is really bright"}
{"source": " Almost so bright, that when you're looking to adjust the controls, it makes it somewhat hard to see what you're doing"}
{"source": "All in all, if you're looking for a cheap compressor to boost your  treble strings and give em some extra punch, this may be the pedal for you, especially if you only have $20"}
{"source": "If you're looking for a warm full bodied compressor, this is not the choice for you"}
{"source": " You should really wait and get the MXR Dyna Comp for just a few bucks more"}
{"source": "This was EXACTLY what I needed this being the 3rd compressor I bought"}
{"source": " I use it for vocals it drops bass a little is super quiet and has a mid range bump"}
{"source": " So happy I got this (I got a used one and its in perfect condition so that was a bonus too) Behringer rules!"}
{"source": "For years I was lugging around a large rack case with my Mackie board and a host of rack effects (reverb, delay, compressors etc"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": " While using the rack I had a line from my programmable guitar effects pedal (Boss) that went to a rack compressor then out to my little Vox amp (the internal compressor in my Boss ME-30 pedal was terrible)"}
{"source": " I was very happy with this set up for about 10 years but about a year ago I stopped using the rack (smaller clubs and places with too many stairs)"}
{"source": " Since then I went to a smaller PA (Soundcraft Gigarac and some active Mackie speakers)and started using that terrible compressor in the otherwise decent Boss pedal"}
{"source": " A few months ago I took out my old box of effects pedals and built a small pedal board"}
{"source": " This worked great but I couldn't locate my old Ibanez CS9 compressor and years ago I know gave away my MXR"}
{"source": " I needed a compressor pedal for my new pedal board that worked as well as the Alesis"}
{"source": "Seems like I found a winner"}
{"source": " This MXR clone from Behringer seems to work as well if not better than the MXR and is much quieter"}
{"source": " Some people have mentioned a slight bump on the upper mids of the compressed signal (and I agree that it is there) but it's not hiss or added noise and I like the sound"}
{"source": " My main guitar is a mid 90's Epiphone Sheriton and it sounds great through the Behringer DC9"}
{"source": " I can't comment of the durability because I haven't had it that long but the case is metal and everything feels solid"}
{"source": " I don't crank up the compression too much and I leave the pedal on about 90% of the time to control the overall signal from my pedal board (My pedals in order: Ibanez TS9, Ibanez Super Tube (a 1984 pedal that was made between the TS9 and TS10) a cheap chorus pedal, Ibanez DE7 delay into a Behringer DR600 Reverb"}
{"source": ")For $24"}
{"source": "00 this compressor does just what it's supposed to do"}
{"source": " It's a two knob \"sqeezer\" just like old MXR and just works"}
{"source": " (No need to worry about compression ratios, thresholds, release points or attack settings)"}
{"source": " Two knobs: one to set the overall compression and one to adjust the output volume"}
{"source": " Great simple pedal clean sound"}
{"source": "Update: I have had this pedal now for about 1 1/2 years"}
{"source": " I notice one reviewer said that the bass sound dropped out on his guitar signal with this pedal"}
{"source": " I have to admit that this is true"}
{"source": " It's not a huge drop in the bottom end tone but it is noticeable"}
{"source": " This pedal is not something that I would use too heavily, it does a nice job compressing peaks and overall range and gives you a nice smooth sound"}
{"source": " If you are looking for a guitar pedal to \"sustain\" the sound you may want to look at other pedals"}
{"source": " This is just a basic compressor not a true \"sustainer\" and at high levels it will probably make you sound very \"thin\" as the compression ratio gets above 3"}
{"source": "5-4"}
{"source": "0 or higher"}
{"source": " On the other hand most stomp pedal compressors under $80-100"}
{"source": "00 will do pretty much the same thing"}
{"source": " My Alesis rack compressor will knock the punch out of a signal at high levels also"}
{"source": " The sound is clean but it's best used for a little compression, not the huge amounts needed to call it a \"sustainer\""}
{"source": " Try the Behringer CS400 for more sustain"}
{"source": "Almost a perfect pic for me"}
{"source": " I use a "}
{"source": "73mm"}
{"source": " Just wish it was more like a fender pic finish"}
{"source": "that being fender seems to stick to your fingers better"}
{"source": " This pic seems to have a coating that makes is slightly softer to the touch or something"}
{"source": "  Still prefer this pic to the fender because this one holds up much much better- in comparison to fender mediums"}
{"source": "Between the blue and the yellow, I have my needs covered"}
{"source": "  These have a weird feeling when you first get them, like they have powder on them"}
{"source": "  But within 10 minutes of using it, it'll stick with you much better"}
{"source": "  I love these picks"}
{"source": "I'm a beginner guitar player going on intermediate and I've quickly learned that anything from Jim Dunlop is quality stuff"}
{"source": "Unfortunately I wasn't aware that slides come in all sizes and got a medium when I need the large"}
{"source": " The medium fits over my pinky finger and while that's okay I prefered it fit over my index finger where I'd have more control"}
{"source": "I cannot fault the slide for my foolish choice so I'll pass this onto my son or someone who can use it and get myself the larger Dunlop 212 Slide"}
{"source": "I originally purchased the large size and found it to be a bit too big, thus I wanted to try the medium"}
{"source": " It's much smaller than the large, but it fits my fingers well (I'd say I have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy)"}
{"source": " The glass is pretty thin, so it is not as sturdy as the large, but I think it should last a while"}
{"source": " As long as you don't drop it all the time, it should be ok"}
{"source": " Definitely recommend this slide (especially for its price)"}
{"source": "I found the price on Amazon cheaper than my local guitar shop and quickly bought it"}
{"source": " The slide works smoother than a brass slide on an acoustic/electric guitar and also sounds great with a Cigar Box Guitar with piezo pickup"}
{"source": " The slide is thick and the large size fits well on the middle, ring and pinky finger"}
{"source": "I found the tone of both guitars brighter and more defined using this slide compared to a brass slide which suits an electric guitar better IMO"}
{"source": " I have not tried a ceramic slide with any guitar, but a Dunlop ceramic slide is most likely a future purchase"}
{"source": "Jim Dunlop products are solid and last long for the most part, their slides seem to be the most popular brand aside for boutique bottle slides and I think this one will last a long time"}
{"source": "For what it's supposed to do, it works very well"}
{"source": " I also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better I think"}
{"source": " This is still usable, but it is for very big fingers"}
{"source": " I think I have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there, but this still leaves some extra room"}
{"source": " Either way, it works well"}
{"source": " It feels very sturdy and I'm not worried about it cracking anytime soon"}
{"source": " For the price, it's a must have"}
{"source": "I have large hands (I wear an XXL glove) but I guess not thick fingers (Ring Size 12/13)"}
{"source": " If you want to use this one on your ring finger, consider getting a smaller size"}
{"source": "As for the tone of the slide, it is very warm and has great sustain due to the very heavy glass!"}
{"source": "This is my first slide, I never use slide to play my guitar, look good size is right for me"}
{"source": " I just have to learn how to use it ;-)"}
{"source": "I bought this along with a Clayton \"large\" glass slide"}
{"source": "  Well the Clayton was very thin walled and didn't even fit over my ring finger knuckle"}
{"source": "  This slide is very thick and works great!"}
{"source": "I thought that a large would be perfect for my fat digits but this thing is big"}
{"source": " It really doesn't affect play at all so it doesn't matter"}
{"source": "I agree with all the other reviews"}
{"source": " These are high quality sounding, very comfortable (I have a big head too!), durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack"}
{"source": " Unless you make money with your headphones (or have money to burn) you probably don't need anything better than the M50's"}
{"source": " The only thing I would change would be to get rid of the collapsible cans - they make the headphones take up less room when folded (good for travelling) but I'm old fashioned and prefer rigid phones, they are a bit quicker to get on and off when you don't have to unfold them and flip the cans in the right orientation"}
{"source": " No big deal though! Comes with nice screw on 1/8\" to 1/4\" adaptor"}
{"source": "These cans were decent, back when they were just above 100 bucks"}
{"source": " They've inflated to 160 and that's just ridiculous"}
{"source": " There is better in this price range"}
{"source": " The SRH840's for example on eBay for 120~ bucks new, does everything better than these cans"}
{"source": " The M50's have really punchy bass, and extremely stringent highs, they're very loose in the low end, and their mids are recessed"}
{"source": " That combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience"}
{"source": " The pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable, whilst having an almost starchy texture to them"}
{"source": " The headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath"}
{"source": " These phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all, which means for gaming, these will be pretty terrible"}
{"source": " They do some"}
{"source": " SOME"}
{"source": " new genres alright, but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to"}
{"source": " They also can't do lighter genres like Jazz and Classical due to their poor positoning"}
{"source": " There are much much better monitors in this price range than these, the Shure SRH840 as I've said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas"}
{"source": "Stay away, don't fall victim to the noob hype"}
{"source": "I was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones"}
{"source": "They are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones"}
{"source": "But the would do just perfect for recording vocals but when it comes listening to music I say go for Dr"}
{"source": "Dre Beats"}
{"source": "If you want to know what the noise isolation feels like , just putting your hands on your ear"}
{"source": "These headphones are kind of classics"}
{"source": "  Very popular and you can read all about them on the headphone review websites"}
{"source": "  They are certainly a cut above your cheap headphones"}
{"source": "  However, when I compare them to my other headphones (Sennheiser HD595's) I find that these are very, very inferior"}
{"source": "  I had originally intended for them to be used with my digital piano because I wanted some isolation, which my HD595's do not provide"}
{"source": "  These do provide isolation but the sound is markedly inferior"}
{"source": "  I think closed-style headphones are just not up to the task of reproducing high quality classical music like open style headphones"}
{"source": "I use these at work now"}
{"source": "  They are excellent at blocking out room noise and they provide enough quality for me to listen to music while working"}
{"source": "Unfortunately they are also not nearly as comfy as my Sennheisers"}
{"source": "  They are a bit too small for my ears, I guess"}
{"source": " And they get hot"}
{"source": "  Overall they are just not as good"}
{"source": "  They were a good price, though, and they fill a niche that I need"}
{"source": "  If only I could find a set of really high quality closed cans for my piano now"}
{"source": "garbage if you like it"}
{"source": "then buy it"}
{"source": "this is NOT how the world of music sounds"}
{"source": "TOO MUCH BASS and other garbage"}
{"source": "are you guys really HEARING anything ?world has gone bass crazy since about 1981"}
{"source": "more and more"}
{"source": "we lost analog, we lost quality thanks tocompression and mp3, and now to put morecrap into our ears, they give you ONEfrequency"}
{"source": "bass ONLY , take it or leave it"}
{"source": "will go find REal headphones, thanks"}
{"source": "kb"}
{"source": "I've tried different kinds of headphones in the past and so far the Bose AE2 fits my taste"}
{"source": " I've been using it for years when my son borrowed it a month ago and I'm pretty sure he has no intention of giving it back :) (Its the 5th headphone he borrowed) so I planned to buy another one but I said to myself why not try something different"}
{"source": " After reading all the reviews on this product I finally decided to go for it"}
{"source": " And WOW"}
{"source": "i was blown away"}
{"source": " I'm glad I tried something else"}
{"source": " No regrets"}
{"source": " This one really fits my taste"}
{"source": " The clarity is superb and the bass is awesome"}
{"source": "I am completely blown away with these headphones"}
{"source": " The second I got them in the mail I plugged it up to my mac pro, opened up itunes and played a song"}
{"source": " Simply put it was amazing, I was able to hear EVERY single track individually! I later plugged the ATH-M50's into a Korg triton studio, recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results"}
{"source": " The sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on (which is a great thing)"}
{"source": " I have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and I keep coming back"}
{"source": " I have seen a few people comment that the bass is not \"punchy enough\" this is simply not true, the bass is amazing, any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source"}
{"source": " Make no mistake the ATH-M50's are extremely accurate and sound fantastic"}
{"source": "I play Guitar for the first time i have a head set that the drivers are not being over driving giving a distorted sound"}
{"source": " The calrity is amazing !"}
{"source": "These headphones are wonderful to wear"}
{"source": "  They sound great"}
{"source": "  But that's not enough now a days"}
{"source": "  With the head band being connected to the outside of the muff, they fit your head so wide"}
{"source": "  The pioneer hdj 2000 has the look"}
{"source": "  Read my review on those though"}
{"source": "  They are terrible"}
{"source": "At first glance these things are serious pro grade, they are made of very durable components"}
{"source": " Both ears swivel and they fit snug to the head"}
{"source": " The head band isn't bad, it's a plastic material i notice that when i stretch it to see how flexible it is the pad on the top of the head starts to come unglued"}
{"source": " Not really a big concern though"}
{"source": " They have a long cord, and I'll talk more about it later"}
{"source": " It ends with a spin on 1/4 in or a standard 3"}
{"source": "5mm"}
{"source": "The sound out of these things is pristine"}
{"source": " It's not muddy and very clear"}
{"source": " They have a good amount of bass"}
{"source": "  Because of the over ear style they drown a lot of background noise out and they also don't leak noise like a lot of headphones do"}
{"source": "Pros- Heavy duty- Awesome sound- Comfortable headband- Over ear design- Not worried about breaking when i through them in my bag- Always clear, never muddy, even at high volumes- Very clear left and right ear markings- Spin on 1/4 PlugCons- Heavy coil cord- Heavy (weight never got annoying though)- Looks"}
{"source": "I'm using this in V1 in a 5 watt tube amp"}
{"source": "  It's really nice"}
{"source": "  I tried the NOS route and I much prefer this tube"}
{"source": "  The other good thing is it comes in a box from JJ, unlike some tubes from other places I've ordered where they seem to lose their original boxes along the way and it looks like everyone and their brother has been messing with them"}
{"source": "I have a VOX AC4TV"}
{"source": " It uses (stock) a 12AX7, but I thought I would try the 12AT7 just to see what happened"}
{"source": " I had read that this type of tube could give you more clean headroom"}
{"source": "After a little test run, my first impression was that the amp was noticeably quieter with this tube installed"}
{"source": " It might have reduced the volume by a third or more - but this came with the benefit of the amp being noticeably less noisy"}
{"source": " That was a nice benefit"}
{"source": "I didn't notice much of a change tonally"}
{"source": " I think this tube basically brought the volume down"}
{"source": " I wouldn't say this is better or worse than the 12AX7, just quieter, and with significantly less output"}
{"source": "I ended up switching back to the 12AX7"}
{"source": "I've had this pedal for over a year now and I've been getting more and more into tube amps and I've learned to appreciate how the intricacies of how all of this gear works together (amps, guitars and pedals)"}
{"source": "When I first reviewed this pedal, I had just gotten a new solid state amp and I was very let down"}
{"source": " After I jumped to tube amps, I grew to appreciate it a little bit more, but I was using it wrong; I'd just match the output of my amp and goose the distortion level to use it as a 2nd channel/gain stage"}
{"source": " I thought it lent a good distorted tone to my playing, but I dismissed it as just an \"OK\" box"}
{"source": "Flash forward: This thing kills! It belongs in front of a tube amp; period"}
{"source": " I've found, as all before me, that dirt boxes are virtually useless on solid state amps"}
{"source": "The D III works very well as a clean boost: Max the volume, set tone to taste and the roll the distortion all the way back"}
{"source": " This will blast your clean amp into overdrive, without much coloration on your tone"}
{"source": " This is my preferred setting as I can use it to push my single channel tube amps into dirty territory like I would before, using it as a second channel, but with that natural tube sound"}
{"source": " Any pedal that gives you some more \"umph\" without altering the original sound of your amp is a beautiful thing"}
{"source": "Dial the output down some, and crank the volume on the amp a bit more, the distortion knob really adds some nice saturated gain that increases sustain and can creep up on getting a significantly dirtier tone"}
{"source": " I found that this is reminiscent of a classic tube screamer; while not tonally identical, this can really help push a hotter amp into overdrive to get some heavy, heavy tones, while retaining the sound of the amp's natural distortion"}
{"source": "In between, you can dial in some classic crunch tones suitable for rock and blues or just a smooth overdrive"}
{"source": " After playing around with the knobs, I found that this is a very versatile and well voiced pedal"}
{"source": " I actually prefer it to tube screamers and its clones as that's been done to death; the D III is conceptually the same, but it just sounds \"different\" that the TS and it doesn't let go of the low end"}
{"source": "For the price, this is a fantastic buy"}
{"source": " It delivers enough output to be used as a fantastic clean boost, and there's enough gain on tap to dial in just about any rock tone you'd want, save for modern high gain metal"}
{"source": "MXR make pretty good Pedals for the money"}
{"source": " I thought that this would be a high output, saturated type distortion"}
{"source": " It is not"}
{"source": " It has plent of Volume, which is good for boosting"}
{"source": " But, even with the Gain Knob turned all the way up, this thing is an Overdrive"}
{"source": " Which is not a bad thing, if that's what you are looking for"}
{"source": " Very Mid-Rangey sound as well"}
{"source": " Just not for me"}
{"source": " But it's well built and would make a decent OD"}
{"source": " But, overall, a pretty Vanilla flavored Dirt Pedal"}
{"source": "This is another in the MXR \"Distortion\" line"}
{"source": " The Distortion III has a more overdrive flavor than a high gain pedal like the Boss Metal Zone or the Barber Dirty Bomb but is very flexible"}
{"source": " Not really for heavy metal (see the MXR 116 Fullbore Metal) but more for that AC/DC and classic rock sound"}
{"source": "There is a lot of gain on tap from the output section so it is possible to hit the front of a tube amp hard without turning up the distortion"}
{"source": " The tone knob does not have a dramatic sweep but is useable"}
{"source": "The good thing about this pedal apart from the price is you do not get that \"fizzy\" top end that some pedals have when you crank the distortion"}
{"source": " In addition, the pedal cleans up nice when you roll back the tone knob"}
{"source": "Pedal is hardwired true bypass and very pedal board friendly"}
{"source": "I was looking for a crunchy type distortion but this is more like a overdrive"}
{"source": " I don't hold it against the pedal though"}
{"source": " I have a Marshall Class 5 and this pedal actually sounds a little bit like the overdrive I get from the amp, I say this as a compliment"}
{"source": " In my case, however, why would I want to replicate what I already have? I'm gonna return it and save up some money to get a BB preamp"}
{"source": " You should check out the 78 Badasss Distortion from MXR too"}
{"source": "If you want to use this to power up a Tascam DR series digital recorder, I have a less expensive solution for you:  if you own a usb wall charger (like a cell phone charger), you can use that to power your device through its usb port"}
{"source": " That's a lot cheaper than spending twenty-something dollars on an additional wall wart!"}
{"source": "behringer perfect pedalboardI can play with my musical band as a real professional with this pedalboard pb1000 from costa rica I recommend it"}
{"source": "thanks behringer"}
{"source": "If you are using Electro-Harmonix, Red Witch, Voodoo Labs or the larger MXR pedals, they won't fit in the styrofoam cutouts"}
{"source": " You can, though, just take that styrofoam pad out and velcro the effects on to the board"}
{"source": "I also have a Morley wah and they have big footprints, so they will take up a good initial chunk of room on the board"}
{"source": " If you have a Cry Baby, though, everything should fit a little more comfortably"}
{"source": " Right now, I have the Morley sitting outside the board due to the number of pedals I own and that four of them are a little outsized (MXR ten band EQ, EHX Electric Mistress, Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz)"}
{"source": "There is some hum, but it isn't so pronounced that it interferes that much with your sound"}
{"source": "So for all that you get with this and the fact that it cuts down almost totally on the need for adapters (except a DOD Malmsteen preamp overdrive), this is a great deal"}
{"source": " Of course, the durability is still in question at this point"}
{"source": "I purchased this because even though I use mostly Boss effects, I also use a Behringer Hell-babe Wah"}
{"source": " Some of the reviews mentioned that Boss effects fit perfectly and that there is a 'footprint' for a wah type effect"}
{"source": " I must say thanks to those reviewers! The only issue I have is that I'm kinda slow, so it took me a while to realize that I had to unscrew a part of the actual board in order for the wah to sit comfortably"}
{"source": " I was also a little bit apprehensive about using the supplied adapter with all of my pedals in case there was some sort of conflict, but so far it has been a perfect experience! This is such a sturdy board"}
{"source": " I must say though, that I had no idea it would be so huge! This is a perfect addition to any serious rig"}
{"source": " UPDATE 21/6/10: I've finally filled all the available slots with the addition of the Boss Phase Shifter"}
{"source": " So far this board has performed superbly! Yes, there is some noise (as there always is when using overdrive/distortion pedals), but no more than is to be expected"}
{"source": " I use a Boss Noise Suppressor (Sorry if this is beginning to look like a Boss ad) and it works perfectly!"}
{"source": "This is a fantastic little recorder, but not for $300"}
{"source": "  I bought mine used for $75 on a bass player's forum in the classified section"}
{"source": "  That was over 3 years ago"}
{"source": "  It has recorded almost every show I play, which is about 2-5 gigs a month, plus a couple rehearsals"}
{"source": "  I record for my own learning purposes, and sometimes to make very rough demo's (some audio is better than no audio!) and have come to really appreciate what this little gadget can do"}
{"source": "  The interface is not perfect and there is a little bit of a learning curve with the settings, but if you use the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) setting, the recording level is taken care of"}

{"source": "raw files by changing the extension (but first make a copy of the original file so that if you make a mistake you have a backup) and import the file into Audacity as a "}
{"source": "raw file"}
{"source": " From there you can edit as normal and save your edited songs as "}
{"source": "mp3 files"}
{"source": "I've had this for several years"}
{"source": " It has worked flawlessly"}
{"source": " It has done a pretty good job with many recordings, especially in the field"}
{"source": " Zoom has now upgraded this unit and has other models on the market that are superior"}
{"source": "  At the time this first came out it was one of the best on the market in its price class"}
{"source": "I just bought it records very well even a whisper from pretty far away"}
{"source": " Excellent fer recording acoustic's"}
{"source": "Finally, a product that is as simple to use as a point-and-shoot camera"}
{"source": "  Literally, I opened the box, put in two batteries, the memory card, read the quick-start guide, put the Zoom on the included stand, and got out my mandolin and started recording"}
{"source": "  The sound quality is great, and you can play it back directly on the Zoom by plugging in some head-buds (included)"}
{"source": "  The control buttons operate like a DVD remote, with a \"menu\" button, using the \"fast-forward\" and \"reverse\" to scroll through entries, and the \"record\" button as the \"set\""}
{"source": "For someone who is not well-versed in audio terminology, gain, sampling rates, mics, pre-post amps, levels whatever, I just set it to medium gain, watched to make sure the lines don't go too far up, and was recording away in two steps"}
{"source": "  Push \"record\" to test the gain level, and push \"record\" again, (red light stays on), to record, and push \"record\" to stop"}
{"source": "  The file is saved, and then you can push play/pause to listen back"}
{"source": "  Deleting files is a few extra steps but if you know how to program a VCR you can use this puppy"}
{"source": "It is also handy, portable and easy to take places"}
{"source": "  I will take it to record jam sessions, music lessons, and practice to evaluate my playing, and instrument comparisons"}
{"source": "  The sound quality is great, and I could hear how resonant and clear my mandolin is"}
{"source": "  I wish my playing was as great since it recorded pick noise, finger slide noise, and other assorted twangs and twings"}
{"source": "  It records both in WAV (huge files) and mp3 (compressed), with various quality levels to choose from"}
{"source": "  You can easily connect it to a computer (Windows/Mac) with the included USB cable"}
{"source": "The only thing missing is a remote"}
{"source": "  Since you have to push the button on the recorder, you have to move to it to activate/deactivate it"}
{"source": "  Also picks up noise from your movements"}
{"source": "  But for the price $199, it's a real gem"}
{"source": "I always look for the one thing in a product that is a surprise, doesn't cost a lot and delights the customer"}
{"source": "  On this one, it is the included wind sock, a tiny foam cap that you can slip on top of the unit to screen the wind for outdoors recording"}
{"source": "  Cool!"}
{"source": "This small device has amazing quality"}
{"source": " The built-in mic records very well compared to those tiny hand-held mono-recorders"}
{"source": " Mic gain controls boost volume BUT add some noise (like reviews state) but when used on low-gain, record quite well"}
{"source": " Audio-IN records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer (I used a Behringer U-802) for AMAZINGLY clear recordings"}
{"source": " Several types of SDHC cards work well and have NOT found a card that did NOT work with this device"}
{"source": " Even NiMH (1"}
{"source": "2V) batteries can power this, although alkaline (1"}
{"source": "5V) last longer"}
{"source": "CON: The plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully"}
{"source": "I purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price"}
{"source": " After trying to use it I promptly returned it"}
{"source": " I do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows"}
{"source": "  I have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer"}
{"source": "  I tried recording on the H2 using it's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my Mackie sound board or my stereo receiver"}
{"source": "  No matter how I set the levels the recording on the H2 was very distorted"}
{"source": "  I played with the record levels and the AGC and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal"}
{"source": "  I have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean, good quality sound"}
{"source": "  The problem with my H2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal, which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp"}
{"source": " Recording from the internal mics seems to work fine"}
{"source": "  I have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the Zoom recorders are the only brand where I have found this problem"}
{"source": "The H2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings, look for something else"}
{"source": "  I exchanged this model for an H4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal, but not as bad as the H2"}
{"source": "  I finally ended up getting the Tascam DR-07 which I am very happy with"}
{"source": "  It has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder"}
{"source": "I also own an Olympus LS-10"}
{"source": "  This gives me the same recording ability 96/24 but it is much less expensive"}
{"source": "  You do get the ability to record with four channels which I am dying to try once I get my hands on 5"}
{"source": "1 encoding software"}
{"source": "  Also nice and not included with other brands, A tripod to hold the unit, a handle to use the unit like a microphone, charger, and earbuds"}
{"source": "Some have noted the zoom doesn't have speakers built in"}
{"source": "  If you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it"}
{"source": "  You need monitors or quality headphones"}
{"source": "  I find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments"}
{"source": "As I said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material"}
{"source": "  Olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls"}
{"source": "  This may be a big issue if you don't treat your equipment carefully"}
{"source": "  Time will tell, but I have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the money"}
{"source": "I am also looking at the Zoom H1 which will come out in Sept"}
{"source": " 2010"}
{"source": "  This product may actually be the LS-10 killer"}
{"source": "There are so many reviews of this little jewel, I won't bother going into details but it's everything I could have hoped for and more"}
{"source": " The sound quality is amazing and it's very easy to use"}
{"source": " I'm using it for so many things including a music player for my truck"}
{"source": " I take it everywhere and it has never let me down"}
{"source": " I had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that ARE included, I have no complaints"}
{"source": "I play and teach classical guitar and needed a good digital recorder with which to record myself and my students and also be able to convert to mp3 format to upload to the internet"}
{"source": "  I've recorded several solo pieces and it does pick up the guitar very well, including all string squeaks and fret buzzes (darn it)"}
{"source": "  So, it will force you to clean up your playing a bit"}
{"source": "  If you are a musician and want a recorder that is very portable and relatively easy to use, then this little gadget is quite good"}
{"source": "  It won't give you \"recording studio\" quality, but you can clearly hear the deep tones of a classical guitar and no hiss, or background noise (unless you have big-mouthed birds like I do) so you're recording is very clear"}
{"source": "When I get ready to record, I set the gain as described in the manual, then set the recorder on my music stand and begin playing"}
{"source": "  Since I bought the 4G card, I can play the piece as many times as I need too in a row without worrying about it running out of memory just as I finally play the piece to my specifications"}
{"source": "  Also, if you connect the H2 to an electrical outlet and not rely on the batteries, that is one less worry"}
{"source": "  Your H2 won't die during recording because the batteries give out"}
{"source": "I can't really tell any difference in the recording quality with or without the wind sock that came with it"}
{"source": "  It sounds the same"}
{"source": "  I guess if I were a singer I would use it to screen out wind but a guitar doesn't really need it"}
{"source": "  Yes, the screen is very small and difficult to read - I keep a magnifying glass handy, but now I've pretty much got the button pushing sequences memorized and don't need to use it as often to see the screen"}
{"source": "  Also, download a free editing program such as \"Audacity\" so you can convert your recordings to various formats"}
{"source": "I'd give it 5 stars if the case was a little more substantial"}
{"source": "  It seems fragile and I dropped it once but luckily it bounced off my foot which had a big fuzzy house shoe on it so it didn't break"}
{"source": "  But it might have if I had not broken it's fall"}
{"source": "  And you will need a longer USB cord"}
{"source": "  I can't believe the one they sent was so short"}
{"source": "  But that is a very easy fix and overall this is one nice little tool"}
{"source": "  And for the price, I'd buy it again!  :-}UPDATE 2"}
{"source": "22"}
{"source": "12I'm still using the H2 Zoom on almost a daily basis to record my students playing and my own playing"}
{"source": "  I still love it, it works great and I feel I really purchased a great item"}
{"source": "Not sure that title is good grammar, but anyway: I have gotten so much use out of my H2!  I'm a music teacher, and I have recorded music classes and performing groups"}
{"source": "  Being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye (and ear-) opening for those kids!It is very easy to use"}
{"source": "  The various recording quality settings are useful, so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more space-saving mp3 setting"}
{"source": "You can record stereo from just in front of the unit, or you can turn on 4-way, all-around recording"}
{"source": "I've used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments"}
{"source": "  I often record one part of a duet, then play along with it"}
{"source": "You can do some editing on the unit, but it's easier to download the track and use some software to do it"}
{"source": "  I have gone direct to disk, though, just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end, which is some of the editing you can do on the H2"}
{"source": "There is little to fault with it"}
{"source": "  It takes a while to rename a track, for instance, but there again you could do it on your desktop after you download"}
{"source": "Prior to this I had a Sony minidisc recorder, which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time I bought it"}
{"source": " I finally got tired of messing with discs"}
{"source": "I am very glad I got the H2"}
{"source": "I'm raising my rating, and the result?  Getting \"demoted\" from the front page"}
{"source": "  In any case, even though I recently picked up the Sony PCM-D50 from Amazon, I'm sufficiently impressed by the Zoom H2 to give it 5 stars and endorse it for anyone who wants professional quality results without the grief and expense of 8-16 track digital recorders or even the fuss of more complicated personal recorders"}
{"source": "  For quite a while its only competition was the Edirol-R09, but as the price has come down, the Zoom H2 stands out from its immediate competition"}
{"source": " Currently, the H2 is my \"back-up\" unit"}
{"source": "  But for convenience or stealth purposes, I often use it as my main recorder"}
{"source": "Anyone who receives this item is guaranteed to be impressed"}
{"source": "  Production values haven't been spared in terms of the packaging; the included equipment (no batteries but a power adapter, protective pouch, handy table stand, mic stand adapter, wind screen, ear buds, USB cable, and a 256mb SD card); and the manual (a quick set-up sheet plus an ample booklet with generous-sized print written in clear, idiomatic English that makes some of Sony's recent instruction manuals look torturous by comparison)"}
{"source": "The screen and controls, admittedly, are minuscule, requiring sharp eyes (though the screen is well-illuminated) and nimble fingers (I much prefer the knobs and slider switches of my Sony to the touch-pad of the Zoom)"}
{"source": "  What's encouraging about this recorder, apart from the price, is that the designers at Zoom have made the H2 with the genuine audiophile and/or all-around musician in mind"}
{"source": "  It's not simply another \"guitar player's gadget,\" loaded down with an endless supply of effects, loops, rhythm and bass tracks, files within files, programs buried within programs"}
{"source": "  The H2, unlike my pricey Sony, can handle both "}
{"source": "wav and mp3 protocol, has microphone fields ranging from 90 degrees to 360 degrees,  is capable of applying compression limiting to recorded files, offers a wide range of sensitivity and placement for recording lectures, conversations, solo performers and orchestras"}
{"source": "  In short, the device promises to deliver the quality of some of recorders costing a thousand or more--and in a practical digital storage card format"}
{"source": "Other Pluses:  Although the instructions are quick to point out the input for an external microphone (the pictured ones are the two popular stereo mics made by Sony, costing $60 and $90 respectively), the Zoom onboard mic (actually 4) is darn good"}
{"source": "  It captured the range and resonance of a grand piano and even managed to pick up a conversation in the kitchen and a grandfather clock's  chimes from upstairs"}
{"source": "  And it's reassuring to see a mic with a surface area reminiscent of the mics of the past (a single tiny hole is more common these days)"}
{"source": "  Getting the recorded signal onto a computer's hard-drive is expedited with the included USB"}
{"source": "2 cable, and from there you can edit the wave pattern in a program like Cool Edit (which I strongly recommend over editing in the recorder)"}
{"source": "  There's also a metronome on board (potentially useful for a student musician during practice sessions) and a tuner (useful for a student musician or a pro who wants his instrument to be in tune before recording)"}
{"source": "Possible drawbacks: 1"}
{"source": " Zoom admittedly has overdone things a bit with all of the audiophile bells and whistles--limiters, compressors, cut-off levels, AGC control, auto-dynamic levels, sensitivity ratios, panning effects, and the list goes on"}
{"source": "  It's too easy to miss a step, to waste precious time fumbling with the menu, to find your fingers going numb while making all of these tiny adjustments"}
{"source": "  Moreover, the instructions, while clear and abundant, omit much information that would help the beginner"}
{"source": "  The hypothetical audience keeps changing from someone who's a complete newbie to someone who's a knowledgeable aficionado"}
{"source": "  And I have great difficulty imagining a harried band director or impatient student taking the time to fiddle with scrolling through the tiny screen's menu to get to a metronome or tuner"}
{"source": " (Frankly, with 75 kids squirming in their seats I'd go to the old single-function, dial-up, block-shaped metronome without a second thought"}
{"source": ")2"}
{"source": " The H2 is so light that using it with the AC adaptor seems rather incongruous if not highly unlikely"}
{"source": "  Undoubtedly you'll want to pick up a 2 to 4 GB SD card and a good supply of double A batteries (it takes only 2) to record in the field"}
{"source": "  At standard MP3 (128-meg) quality, you should be good for dozens of hours"}
{"source": "  (The adaptor would have made more sense if Zoom had enabled it to charge batteries that could remain in the recorder"}
{"source": ")3"}
{"source": " My H2 would not connect to my iMac with OSX Leopard without downloading an upgrade from the Zoom site"}
{"source": " After having some difficulty with the install, I decided to forget about it and simply transfer files in \"real time"}
{"source": "\"What's encouraging about this recorder, apart from the price (2/3 of the H4, 1/2 of the Edirol R-9) is that the designers at Zoom have made the H2 with the genuine audiophile and/or all-around musician in mind"}
{"source": "Perhaps the primary deal-maker or breaker: The tiny screen and small controls"}
{"source": "  Until mastering the miniaturization, I would want to have a \"back-up\" cassette recorder for any performance that I judged of special importance"}
{"source": "  As for build quality, my H2 is like new after almost 18 months use"}

{"source": "  Use it for what it does best--namely, produce realistic audio from a tiny, weightless, durable device that practically makes the added attractions gratuitous and frankly puts to shame  its expensive rivals"}
{"source": "If you can read the tiny little screen, this thing records nicely"}
{"source": " But it's a pain in the Axx to move from one selection to the other"}
{"source": " There were a couple of times I almost threw against the wall"}
{"source": " It has a tendency to completely freeze up and the on/off switch does nothing"}
{"source": " You have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again"}
{"source": "Do you like to shift your booty around on the seat?  You can't with this!  It's too narrow at 17 inches"}
{"source": "  I am going with a wider one"}
{"source": "  (other than that is seems decent)Updated March 4th, 2014: I ordered the On Stage KT7800 and have had it for several weeks now"}
{"source": "  I am much happier with it, and it is easier to adjust"}
{"source": "  The first one I ordered was defective and I had to send it back, butt now I am good to go"}
{"source": "I ordered this bench for last Christmas (2005)"}
{"source": " I'm satisfied so far"}
{"source": " Good value for money"}
{"source": "The seat is generously padded and is 2"}
{"source": "5 inches thick"}
{"source": " Padding material is not too soft, and that is good in my opinion"}
{"source": "All-steel frame construction feels sturdy"}
{"source": "Contrary to one of the reviews, my bench came with height adjustment (it is not on-the-fly kind of thing, though)"}
{"source": " Each of the legs has 3 holes (low, middle, high)"}
{"source": " A fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs, and the bolt becomes the crossing point of \"X\""}
{"source": " Three positions roughly correspond to 18, 19 and 20 inches"}
{"source": "For changing height, all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt, insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it"}
{"source": " Don't worry, you don't need any tool to do the job,  thanks to a large plastic knob"}
{"source": " See the picture and you'll understand how it works"}
{"source": "Mine initially came with middle position"}
{"source": " I also tried high and low, but set it back to middle"}
{"source": " It seems to be a good compromise for my family, as the bench is used daily by me, my wife and my kids"}
{"source": " Sure it's nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily"}
{"source": " However, with this price, I wouldn't complain at all"}
{"source": "First, I would be extremely wary of the durability of any piano bench for under $50"}
{"source": " Second, as a professional piano player I have never found a use for a traveling \"bench\" or \"stool"}
{"source": "\" Think about it: you've got a heavy keyboard to haul plus an amp plus a keyboard stand and maybe a music stand, electric light and music, perhaps even a storage case for the cables, adapters, extra fuses, batteries, tuners, sometimes an extra keyboard or two, or a couple of tone generators with MIDI cables, or, if you still pack a Rhodes, spare tines and a pair of wire cutters--and you're going to add a bench (!) to your weekly moving equipment caravan?In 90% of the locations that I've worked, I'm able to locate a plain chair without arms (usually the kitchen crew knows where the house spartan chair can be found)"}
{"source": " Not only does it reduce by one the paraphernalia, but it helps protect against the body structure problems to which piano players, especially, are prone over the course of thousands of hours of slouching, subjecting finger joints to unhealthy amounts of pressure, too caught up in chords and scales and retrieving half-remembered melodies to register the physical-neurological effects until after the job"}
{"source": "  I've always envied the lounge act players who can stand while playing--far better for the entire musculature configuration of the human anatomy (not to mention prostate)"}
{"source": " In fact, if the club or restaurant has a regular piano bench or one of those padded, rising and lowering black Steinway cushions, try to replace it with a plain chair without arms"}
{"source": " Especially if you're doing 4-hour gigs, sometimes two in the same day, you'll notice the difference short and long term"}
{"source": "Bottom line, your back needs more pampering than your bottom, which is why you need a seat with a back"}
{"source": " Only concert artists like Horowitz and Rubenstein could get away with those cushy Steinway stools--30 minutes to complete the concerto and be done with it (actually most of the stress was gone upon completion of the cadenza of the first movement)"}
{"source": " Some of us aren't that lucky--or gifted--or smart"}
{"source": "the cables are great for the price cant go wrong I have not used them for a long time but so far no problems i ordered 6 more cables"}
{"source": "don't buy this cables they keep failing, cheap material with WHAT I SPENT ON THEM YOU COULD BUY A COUPLE DECENT ONES"}
{"source": "I buy this cable for my dj system and work great"}
{"source": " i used a lot of time with my karaoke"}
{"source": "NOT high quality, but definitely useable and worth the 6 bucks"}
{"source": " Ends are not too bad and it works for what it is"}
{"source": "I have finally learned my lesson"}
{"source": "I have purchased a number of these over the last year or two"}
{"source": " and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say \"good for static applications\" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors"}
{"source": "But they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok"}
{"source": "But now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to work"}
{"source": "A week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain"}
{"source": " yup"}
{"source": "the cable"}
{"source": "So by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items"}
{"source": "please fully check them out"}
{"source": " a simple \"does it work yes/no\" is clearly not good enough, as i learned"}
{"source": "I'm using four of these for Podcasting - they seem just a tiny bit flimsy but for my purposes where they will be gently used I am completely happy"}
{"source": "Would not hesitate to purchase this item"}
{"source": "  I like the flexibility of this microphone cable"}
{"source": "  An easy item to recommend for the price paid"}
{"source": "cable works perfect no defects, cystal clear sound, constructed well, use them in the studio, no noticiable problems, do not know how road worthy they are because I am a studio rat and not performer"}
{"source": "Bought this to replace my 10 ft mice cable"}
{"source": "  Now i have plenty of cable to set up anyway i want"}
{"source": "I don't use it for any heavy use"}
{"source": "  I use it for podcasting purposes"}
{"source": "  Haven't had any problems"}
{"source": "  So I can't speak to really heavy use of the product"}
{"source": "Wow"}
{"source": " This amp is something else"}
{"source": " When it arrived I almost didn't realize what it was because it was so big! This thing does everything! You can set drums, record cords over it and then dub in to the already recorded track and solo over it! But what's even better is you can attach drums to it, a bass to it, a mic to it, and a guitar to it and have a killer jam session!It has more sounds then I had time to comb through at first glance and more features then I know what to do with!AMAZING AMPLIFIER!"}
{"source": "Like another reviewer here, I too own a Fender G-Dec 30 (BTW: now going up for sale)"}
{"source": " The Spider Jam 75W specs are all out there so I won't repeat all that info but give you my users impressions instead"}
{"source": " First I was fortunate enough to buy one for $300"}
{"source": " (the same price as the Fender G-Dec 30), so it's an even simpler comparison for me"}
{"source": "***The Line 6 Spider Jam 75W is a full head & shoulders taller and better than the G-Dec"}
{"source": "***As just simply an amp it has more power & as good of sound"}
{"source": " As for the rest, I'll take line 6's real drums sets and myriad of song backings over the Fender's midi/synthe tunes any day"}
{"source": " The ability to save your custom tunes as JAM or WAV files internally or out to a larger SD card is a godsend and to me, the single biggest factor to own this amp over a G-Dec"}
{"source": " (I use the max 2gb SD - note: it must be fat 16 formatted & is not HC"}
{"source": ") The overdub layering is simply superb (though it's saved as mono)"}
{"source": " The XLR mike, 1/4\" plug aux & MP3 inputs allow a great flexibility for total song creation"}
{"source": " Coupled with my Line 6 Variax guitar, I have been able to produce an amazing range of sounds and songs"}
{"source": "The only criticisms I can muster are: 1) - The menu process is more difficult than the G-Dec but easy enough with hands-on experience"}
{"source": " 2) - The chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap but work well enough"}
{"source": " 3) - Line six really needs to update to an SDHC format so it can utilize larger than 2gb SD storage cards"}
{"source": " I have experimented with using a 4GB non-HC SD card & though I was able to format it, I was not able to read / write to it"}
{"source": " Line 6, please go to SDHC! I would also like to see an improvement to an \"incremented\" or notched amp model selector pot"}
{"source": " As every once in a while it will jump from the A or B selection if not exact"}
{"source": "I can't find a single complain about this amp"}
{"source": " The amp modelling is fantastic"}
{"source": " Plug in for a mic/CD/M3 player"}
{"source": " Quality driver"}
{"source": " I'm not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website"}
{"source": " I used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects"}
{"source": " Only thing I wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds"}
{"source": " But you can't ask for much more for the price of $399"}
{"source": " You won't be disappointed with this amp"}
{"source": "I bought my Spyder Jam back in 2009, when it was fairly new"}
{"source": "  I was simply blown away at the depth and available features on this amp"}
{"source": "  I still am"}
{"source": "  It's just possibly one of the best training and gigging tools for a guitarist out there"}
{"source": "  You can play along with a drum track, with a drum AND rythmn track, and you get hundreds of presets and about 100 to make your own"}
{"source": "  the Spyder pedals make it perfect, allowing you to turn on recording functions, drum and other functions, and also with the expression pedal, you get Wah and Volume"}
{"source": "  The seperate tonal controls are great on this amp, and if you really dive deep into the menus, pitch shifting and timing are also available"}
{"source": "  And with 24 minutes of looping time, that's just crazy for the price"}
{"source": "I found it interesting that for a while, the Spyder IV 75 watter kind of dissapeared off the market in 2011 and part of 2012"}
{"source": " It has basically the same presets of the Jam without the looper or drum and rythmn tracks, and was much less money"}
{"source": "  I'd say it started to cut into Spyder Jam sales"}
{"source": " I have noticed that the Spyder IV 75 watter is back now, but the Jam keeps right on going, with updates and endless support from Line 6"}
{"source": "Even the eight year run of the Fender Cyber Twin, and Cyber Twin SE didn't offer the possibilities of the Spyder Jam, and the Cyber Twin was well over $1000 new"}
{"source": " Yes, it has a tube preamp, and rewires itself to better simulate amps, but the Jam is SO much more in line with the budgets of up and coming guitarists"}
{"source": " No contest, money-wise"}
{"source": " And the Cyber-Twin is gone now"}
{"source": "If you want an amp that you will keep for a long, long time, take a real hard look at the Spyder Jam"}
{"source": "I've had this Amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great"}

{"source": " The common features are easy to use, but if you want to dig in and start really taking advantage of the amp, you will need to invest some time into it"}

{"source": "I have both the Fender G-Dec 15 and the 30 and the Line 6 Spider Jam just blows them away"}
{"source": "The controls are much more intuitive than the G-Dec line (like hitting the level buttonto bring the drum beat volume down so I could hear my guitar over it), and I was able to immediatelybring up whatever backing tracks, or drum beats I wanted and the only time I had to lookin the manual was to figure out how to change the tempo which is very easy"}
{"source": "I only mention these capabilities to compare with the Fender line"}
{"source": "Once you go further into the amp and get into the dubbing/recording it takes a bit moreeffort and the proper foot pedal"}
{"source": "The amp can get really loud and I don't see why you could not use it to gig with as long asthe venue is no larger than a standard bar or side show"}
{"source": "Since I have only had the amp for a short time, I can't say anything about how it will holdup, but I have 8 other amps by different companies, and the quality is just fine"}
{"source": "By the way, I have a G-Dec 30 for sale???Addendum:The following is my take between the Jam and the 4 series, do with it as you wish"}
{"source": "A modeling amp will literally model existing Amps, Artists, and Songs from different years"}
{"source": "The Spider 4 does not have on board song or drum loops like the Spider Jam"}
{"source": "If you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time, then the 4 isyour amp"}
{"source": "If you need a practice amp, go with the Jam"}
{"source": "I have both amps and as far as I am concerned, the Jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the Spider 4 does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more, even if it is based on the Spider 3 technology with a JM4 Looper as its engine"}
{"source": "While the Spider 4 (I have the 150) is a nice amp, it is VERY SPECIFIC to the user needs and isnot that flexible"}
{"source": "I do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals, as I used the Jam for a longtime without, and only acquired the Express pedal when I ordered the Spider 4"}
{"source": "Also be very aware that the Line 6 documentation on their amps is very, very lacking, to put it mildly, and there so-called on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation"}
{"source": "I bought this amp for my 7 year old son"}

{"source": "this amp is small in size but full of sound"}
{"source": "  because of its size there is little bottom end but it still cranks!! very responsive, very clean sounding"}
{"source": " this amp is well worth the price"}
{"source": "I spent a lot of time on Amazon reading reviews - comparing prices"}
{"source": " I wanted an amp that would have overdrive and I also wanted some power"}
{"source": " There are so many choices from the small portable units (I was afraid they would sound like toys) to the big units (They would sound great but I couldn't afford them)"}
{"source": " I am thrilled with the Starcaster"}
{"source": " This amp delivers a huge sound and the overdrive sounds great for grunge and metal while you can also play crisp clear rock or country through it"}
{"source": " If you want a small amp to take anywhere and be able to show your rock star image - this is the one for you"}
{"source": "I got This amp for my 9 year old son along with a Squire mini strat"}
{"source": " Verry good combination"}
{"source": " My son loves them both"}
{"source": "I bought this used off a friend when I got my first Electric"}
{"source": "  It's a great little practice amp that is plenty loud enough for a small room"}
{"source": "  The destortion works well enough"}
{"source": "  Bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine"}
{"source": "  Input jack has held up real well so far (amp is about 4 years old now)and the speaker is pretty clean"}
{"source": "  My only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough"}
{"source": "  I can't practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv"}
{"source": "  I suppose a set of headphones would solve this problem- but then its something else I gotta plug in and worry about"}
{"source": "  I find that I like the sound of the overdrive better (especially thru my Epi LP) but just can't play it low enough"}
{"source": "  I end up having to turn the overdrive off, and then turning the amp up loud and turning the guitar down real low"}
{"source": "  If you have issues with volume control in your house- then make sure to get a set of headphones- or else you could suffer the dirty looks, and the banishment I have suffered"}
{"source": "  All in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point"}
{"source": "I bought this gig bag to carry my Fender strat around"}
{"source": " I'm just starting to learn guitar so I didn't really know much about my options"}
{"source": " I figured I had a Fender guitar so I might as well get a Fender gig bag"}
{"source": "Little did I realize how good this one really is"}
{"source": " Most gig bags don't come with all these storage pockets"}
{"source": " There's plenty of room for a few books, an electronic tuner, string winder, strings, whatever"}
{"source": "Padding could always be more, but that's the case with probably any soft-shell bag you buy"}
{"source": "All-in-all, I like this bag more and more since I've discovered that all the other options in the price range aren't nearly as good"}
{"source": "The previous reviewer obviously got a defective case"}
{"source": " The case I got works incredibly well, and always keeps the guitar well protected, and my back comfortable while carrying it"}
{"source": " It has a lot of space, and it looks pretty good too"}
{"source": " I'd recommend it to anyone!EDIT* I've had 3 good years with this bag, and it has still yet to rip on me"}
{"source": "I bought this bag mostly for practice sessions here and there, or across town"}
{"source": " It's a decent build quality, but I wouldn't feel comfortable assigning it to gig duty"}
{"source": " It's got a fair amount of padding, and a nice storage array, but once again, I personally feel this bag is more suited for a 12 mile trip to practice or lessons"}
{"source": "I was at Guitar Center looking for the right gig bag for my recently purchased Ibanez EW20ASENT Acoustic Guitar, which is virtually identical to theIbanez EW20ZWENT Exotic Woods Series Zebrawood Acoustic Electric Cutaway Guitar, but everything they had in stock was a bit too small"}

{"source": " Turns out I have the \"Dreadnought\" variety, which is a bit larger"}
{"source": " This Fender bag received some great reviews, but I was apprehensive about having to return it if the dimensions weren't correct"}
{"source": " I couldn't find ANY info on the web about the interior dimensions of this bag, so I took the leap"}
{"source": " and I'm so glad I did! Bag is not too snug, not too loose, and has a great array of zippered pockets and dual shoulder straps"}
{"source": " Great padding, yet still lightweight"}
{"source": " And a great price! And it arrived a day early"}
{"source": " sweet"}
{"source": " Ibanez EW20 body (not neck) dimensions: W 16\", D 5\", L 20\""}
{"source": " Thank you Amazon & Fender!"}
{"source": "I bought this one for one of my heavier guitars hoping for some shoulder relief and it does the job"}
{"source": "  It's inexpensive and the padding is excellent"}
{"source": "  It looks like it will last too"}
{"source": "I got this to use with my 12 string"}
{"source": " It is a huge improvement over my other strap, but it is not as padded as some that you'll pay a higher price for"}
{"source": " It does the job, however"}
{"source": " For this price you will be satisfied"}
{"source": "My new electric guitar isn't particularly comfortable to play while sitting, so I needed a strap"}
{"source": "  I've played with straps in the past and always found them to be uncomfortable, so I hoped to find a padded strap that didn't break the bank"}
{"source": "  This strap fits the bill just fine"}
{"source": "  Depending on the angle that your pegs are set, however, you may find that the holes in the strap will with time enlarge to the point that the guitar is always in danger of falling"}
{"source": "  If your pegs are set at an angle, like on a Strat, this strap will last forever"}
{"source": "  If you're on a guitar with a horizontal peg, like a LP, you'll probably want to invest in some strap locks as well"}
{"source": "  This will move the pressure from the strap holes to the metal locks and both extend the lifetime of the strap and its security"}
{"source": "  The padding is OK, but not great - however, it's certainly better than a regular nylon strap and does a good job of forcing the strap to lay flat across the shoulder which is a huge bonus"}
{"source": "I paid only $29 and it is small and convenient"}
{"source": " I was impressed with the sound"}
{"source": "At first I played it with my Line 6 15 watt amp"}
{"source": " I didn't like it cause of the squealing"}
{"source": " But then I read how you use it and all that"}
{"source": " Boy! It worked great"}
{"source": "I use it with a Tascam US 100 USB plugin to my computer and I get a good sound for practice"}
{"source": "I still like my Line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain"}
{"source": " But this is a bargain and small"}
{"source": "You can use this with any USB audio interface"}
{"source": "If you like AC/DC you would like this"}
{"source": " There are different amp sounds you can get"}
{"source": "Cheap and convenient I'am not disappointed"}

{"source": "Guess what"}
{"source": "the reviewers weren't lying (except that one guy who gave it a 2"}
{"source": "what a BS review)!It arrived today, and I decided to give it a quick workout"}
{"source": " I grabbed a small amp (Fender Frontman 15) and plugged in my Strat (with a Seymour Duncan Hotrail at the bridge) and gave it a go"}
{"source": " The 'quick workout' turned into an hour long jam session as I got caught up in what this pedal can do"}
{"source": " It turned my little solid state amp into a fire breather! With the mic at off X, middle set at Hot, and California and 3/4 gain"}
{"source": "this thing just SCREAMS for solos and is very heavy for rhythm"}
{"source": " I spent a good deal of time with this setting just blazing away"}
{"source": "The Tweed and Brit settings were great too, as I tweaked a multitude of tones from this beast"}
{"source": " I've had Behringer pedals before and even though they were decent (vintage delay, slow motion, compressor, eq), I didn't get excited about them"}
{"source": " In fact, I sold the delay and slow mo recently"}
{"source": " This pedal however, is going to get some serious use"}
{"source": " I'm not crazy about the plastic casing, but it seems sturdy enough"}
{"source": " I can't recommend this pedal enough"}
{"source": "the reviews were right! You won't be sorry"}
{"source": "I bought this product for only one reason: I have several amps that are not guitar amps, but stereo or PA-type, clean, high powered , two channels, that I want to use as guitar amps, either as the primary or backup"}
{"source": " This tube modeler acts first as a pre-amp, and then adds gain, volume control, \"crunch\", whatever, to the non-guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps"}
{"source": " I don't really care what tube amps it models, or what mic placement, I just want the guitar amp sound and style"}
{"source": " I also use it in front of a Behringer Ultra-G DI box, so that the DI box splits the signal coming from the TM300 and sends half to my non-guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage, and the other half to the house PA"}
{"source": " I don't think that many people would do this"}
{"source": "The sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp, and kind of amp you are driving with it, and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving"}
{"source": " The acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound, but I've used this box with all of its settings driving PA amps, home stereo amps, bass amps, and guitar amps, all of which drove PA speakers, bass speakers and Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speakers, all in the same acoustic space"}
{"source": " Each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant, sound different: some more like guitar  amps and speakers, some not"}
{"source": " As I said, I don't really care about what tube amp is being modeled, only that I get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box"}
{"source": " It works for me"}
{"source": "I read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog Sansamp GT2, and based on its performance so far, it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the Sansamp can do"}
{"source": " I would consider getting the GT2 in the future, but for now this product is, for me, the poor man's tube amp"}
{"source": "Folks that like the original Ibanez Tube King will love this pedal"}
{"source": "  Sturdier construction than most of Behrenger's other pedals-  The housing is metal and the knobs seem a bit more solid"}
{"source": "  Folks talk about how bad the stock tube is, but that has not been my experience"}
{"source": "  I may experement with a low gain JJ in the future, but the stock tube is staying put for now"}
{"source": "  Maybe I got lucky and they 'hand selected' the right one?  This unit sounds really incredible when it's running into the front end of my EL84 powered tube amp"}
{"source": "  The sound is really organic and gritty, with great harmonics and smooth sustain"}
{"source": " Sounds decent but not nearly as good going into a solid state amp (no suprise there)"}
{"source": "  Still, an improvement from the sterile solid state tone"}
{"source": "  Be forewarned - this pedal is gigantic in dimension"}
{"source": "  Who cares, so long as it sounds this good??  I'd wanted a vintage Chandler/Butler Tube Driver forever, but now I honestly don't need one"}
{"source": "  This pedal gets me there on the cheap!"}
{"source": "The VT999 Vintage Tube Monster has quite quickly become my go-to overdrive pedal, surpassing other OD pedals I've used, including the Digitech Bad Monkey, the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer, the Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive, and remarkably, the Fulltone Fulldrive 2 MOSFET"}
{"source": "The VT999 has several things going for it --- Tweakable EQ (High/Mid/Low) which allows you to run a full spectrum, from muddy, dirty low OD sounds, even from a single coil, to bright, screaming lead tones with high mids or highs"}
{"source": "- Noise gate which can not only eliminate single coil hum but can also be used to \"squeeze\" the tone for some interesting effects- Wide range gain that gets dirty around 9 o'clock and full-on distortion when crankedNow, for full disclosure sake, I did change out the tube to a JJ Tesla 12AX7, but most people who know tubes will tell you that really, tubes are often hit-or-miss, simply on account of them being analog, heater-based elements"}
{"source": " That's part of the fun of tube-based OD"}
{"source": " I have played a VT999 that had a great sounding overdrive, but mine didn't have that sound until I put in a new tube"}
{"source": " Try it out with the stock tube, and go to a different tube if you don't like it"}
{"source": " At least try a new tube before giving up"}
{"source": "There are two things that I don't like about the VT999, and I can tell you -- both gripes have nothing to do with sound or tone"}
{"source": " This pedal got it 100% right with tone after a tube switch"}
{"source": " The 2 issues are:- The housing is huge, and if you look inside, it seems like a waste of space"}
{"source": " There's a lot of open space with nothing there, and while I can concede that tubes heat up and need space to dissipate heat, it's a bit overboard"}
{"source": "- Compared to the Fulldrive, the lack of a boost switch is really a miss"}
{"source": " Especially given the large enclosure, it would make perfect sense to move the 5 knobs to the top half of the pedal and put a boost switch on the right hand side"}
{"source": " That'd take little effort, and given the independent power of this pedal, would be a piece of cake to achieve"}
{"source": " Heck, I could probably do it myself, but I don't want to ruin the good sound this produces"}
{"source": "Bottom line, I understand that on a pedalboard, real estate is everything"}
{"source": " This takes up at least the space of 2 pedals"}
{"source": " Is it worth it? To me, it is"}
{"source": " I run 2 OD pedals on my 2-row board, and I can honestly say, in the last 10 gigs, I have never gone to the other OD"}
{"source": " It's been the Vintage Tube Monster every time"}
{"source": "With some trials using different tubes this pedal can add something that is very tough to get otherwise"}
{"source": " I run my guitar direct because I don't like amps or having to cart the things around"}
{"source": " There are so many shades of tone available that it's tough to really praise this gadget enough especially considering the low cost"}
{"source": " I also found using a compresser before it helps"}
{"source": " I have a Pigtronix Philosopher's Tone & it made a big differrence"}

{"source": " I don't typically keep my guitars in their cases, but bags like this one come in handy for gigs, short trips, moves, etc"}
{"source": " Nice styling touches, too"}
{"source": " The bag has removable back-straps for carrying ease"}
{"source": "My guitars largely stay at home, so they don't require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case"}
{"source": "  Hard cases almost always cost 70 dollars or more, and also take up about twice as much room, which is problematic for storing multiple instruments"}
{"source": "  In most cases, a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs, and costs about 1/4 of the price of a hard case"}
{"source": "I bought two different variations of the Fender Gig Bag, and I believe the one pictured here is the one that has Fender Medium guitar picks as zipper handles, which is a cool touch"}
{"source": "  The case fits my Fender/Squier Strat guitars (or other guitars of a similar size) snugly"}
{"source": "  There is not a ton of padding, but more than you might think from the pictures, especially on top"}
{"source": "  The pocket is fine, and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps"}
{"source": "  I can't say that the zippers will withstand years of use, but for most uses, they should do just fine"}
{"source": "  Glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars"}
{"source": "Not as good as the headstock tuner I purchased"}
{"source": " I used it a few times"}
{"source": " It can be used as tuner or a pickup for my acoustic"}
{"source": "  I wouldn't buy another one"}

{"source": " And it works great: clip to the headstock and it isolates their guitar from the din and delivers a clean signal to the Seiko"}
{"source": "The Seiko tuner has hit the deck many times and still looks like new after a couple years"}
{"source": " Unfortunately the CM-100L is not nearly as durable: wires are thin, delicate and prone to breaking"}
{"source": " If I was the only one using the CM-100L, it would probably last for many years"}
{"source": " But students are rough and can't stop themselves from tightly wrapping the wire around the tuner after they're finished (although I ask them not to)"}
{"source": " The wire gets stressed at the mic clip and/or plug and shorts out"}
{"source": " I burn through one or two CM-100L per semester"}
{"source": " I found a big gob of silicon sealant on stress points helps extend the life of the wire (electrical tape is useless)"}

{"source": "  IT was a direct replacement for the original"}
{"source": "I put this on my Fender Jazz Bass after I bought a new neck for it"}
{"source": " This plate work the exact same as the stock plate, but it dresses the bass up a bit"}
{"source": " This is not a mod that people will see (like pickup covers), but I like the way it looks when I pick it up to play"}
{"source": "Not much to say about a chrome neckplate - it's largely a cosmetic item"}
{"source": "  But my old one (with the serial number) was corroding pretty bad, and I liked the look of the new one"}
{"source": "  A few people have mentioned that it's thinner, but assuming you also have the \"pad\" underneath (which you should) that was not a problem for me at all"}
{"source": "  Anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws"}
{"source": "  Installation took all of 5 minutes and the neck is set up exactly as it was before"}
{"source": "  Looks great!"}
{"source": "It's a simple strap button, don't know what else to say, I can't imagine a strap button not serving it's purpose"}

{"source": " after getting tired of how raw the existing polypropylene strap -which was about the same price just because it had \"Fender\" embroidered on it- was making my neck"}
{"source": "When I put this on the electric the difference was immediately noticable even though my neck was still sore from the cheap strap"}
{"source": "  So I decided to sign in and write this review"}
{"source": "This strap is softer and better made than the poly ones"}
{"source": "It even comes with a string tie for your acoustic, which you might need"}
{"source": "Consider taking my advice: Treat yourself"}
{"source": "$15 for a strap -when guitars cost hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars- is not much"}
{"source": "Besides, the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe"}
{"source": "The only downside is that the strap ends are pretty thick and is very snug on my pegs"}
{"source": "I use c-type snap-on strap locks but they will no longer fit"}
{"source": "Maybe I'll see if the venerable Grolsch strap locks will work"}
{"source": "You can spend more to get wider straps with more padding if you want but do not bother getting something cheaper unless a strap of at least this quality is on sale"}
{"source": "Update: Too snug for Grolsch strap locks on the Squier also"}
{"source": "Very comfortable strap"}
{"source": "  The cotton is soft and does not cut into my neck like some nylon straps do"}
{"source": "  Seems sturdy and is holiding up well so far"}
{"source": "I admit I bought this only because John Frusciante uses a very similar style strap"}
{"source": " But he has good taste"}
{"source": " This strap is strong and sturdy"}
{"source": " Even without strap locks I'm comfortable going crazy on stage"}
{"source": " High quality, does not fray, stays on the guitar"}
{"source": " Does what you want and need and looks great!"}
{"source": "In the interest of full disclosure, this is the first guitar strap I have ever owned"}
{"source": " That being said, the strap is fairly soft and pliable, with that almost broken in feel"}
{"source": " I was expecting it to be a little stiffer, but I'm glad it isn't"}
{"source": " It fit my Ibanez acoustic just fine"}
{"source": " My guitar is nothing fancy, so I would presume the \"strap locks\" are pretty standard"}
{"source": " The fit is really tight at first, so that should be a good thing"}
{"source": " I suppose I could have unscrewed my strap locks to facilitate mounting the strap, but I didn't"}
{"source": "The range of fit seems pretty good to me"}
{"source": " I am 6' tall and wear my acoustic up a little high, kind of \"folk style\" I guess"}
{"source": " If I want to, I can adjust it so that it rides lower around my pelvis area"}
{"source": " One end is suede on both sides and has the tanned leather-logo patch on it, while the other end is black suede on one side and tan suede on the backside"}
{"source": " I can't see it marring the guitar at all"}
{"source": " It is comfortable around my neck and shoulder"}
{"source": " Made in Canada, seems well built and durable"}

{"source": "  According to the first comment and verified from their companies website(which I should have done before buying) the strap is meant for a bass guitar"}
{"source": "  Please don't purchase this thinking it will work for a standard acoustic or probably even an acoustic bass"}

{"source": "  Thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review"}
{"source": "**I'm not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short"}
{"source": "  I currently own two other leather straps and they have the potential to be lengthened so that my acoustic would hang down by my waist or so, even though I usually play it about midway on my torso"}
{"source": "  I don't NEED my straps to be super long but this thing makes it hard to even put the guitar on"}
{"source": "  It just feels a little tight and crammed when I wear it"}
{"source": "  I'll probably end up adding a string at one end just to give myself an extra 4 inches or so"}
{"source": "  The leather itself isn't a bad quality, but it's not the finest"}
{"source": "  I'd suggest dropping an extra $20 or so and getting a very high quality strap"}
{"source": "**I just wanted to clarify that I was reviewing this product in regards to my acoustic guitar"}
{"source": "  I have read some other reviews and it seems that those using it for an electric guitar have no complaints, but being that my acoustic is a good 2-3 times as thick as an electric, it does not serve my needs"}
{"source": "Excellent strap for the money"}
{"source": " The leather is thick and supple"}
{"source": " In fact the materials are so thick, that it can be a little tricky to get the adjustment tail setup"}
{"source": "A note about length- Some might find the standard Levy's strap length too short, so be aware what you need and note there are XL versions of these"}
{"source": " For me, many straps on the market in this price range are just too long for me, including those from Franklin, Dunlop (BMF wide), and Mono (even the short model was about an inch too long)"}
{"source": " I'm a bass player and when standing, I prefer my bass to be at or just above waist height"}
{"source": " A few basses, I prefer higher"}
{"source": " I'd suggest if you have a strap which places your instrument where you are most comfortable, measure button hole to button hole and be sure you're ordering the right length"}
{"source": "I used to have a regular guitar strap on my bass, but when I got a regular weekly bass gig and was using it more often, it started to feel like the strap was digging into my shoulder"}
{"source": " Your mileage may vary on that, but I decided it was time to check out a wider strap that was actually intended for a bass"}
{"source": "I read a lot of reviews and decided on this one -- some of the cheaper leather straps were described as stiff and uncomfortable, but this one was usually reviewed well"}
{"source": " It was the perfect choice"}
{"source": " This strap needs no wearing-in -- it's supple and soft right out of the box"}
{"source": " The leather on top is smooth and classy looking, and the suede underneath is comfortable and soft, with good friction that helps it stay put on your shoulder"}
{"source": " The wider strap distributes the weight of a bass better, and there is some cushioning between the two layers of leather that also helps"}
{"source": " All of this adds up to a great deal of comfort"}
{"source": "I use Dunlop strap locks on my instruments, and with a thicker strap like this, I had some concerns about getting them on there, but with a flat head screwdriver and a little bit of encouragement you can put strap locks on this strap, no problem"}
{"source": "I would highly recommend this strap for any bass player, or even someone with an especially heavy guitar"}
{"source": "This thing is really comfortable, holds the weight of my les paul nicely"}
{"source": " Its slightly wider than most other straps which helps distribute weight better, I can play for 2+ hours and my shoulders feel fine! I feed the narrow end through 3 of the strap holes and it sits flat and looks good"}
{"source": " Well made, feels very strong"}
{"source": "  Texture is very nice, doesnt slip"}
{"source": "  Overall a very good product"}
{"source": "I usually don't buy many guitar straps, and when I do, I like to get a thick, leather-type one, because I've found any other strap seems to bite into my shoulder after a while, and I don't like having metal pieces on the strap that can scratch up my instruments"}
{"source": "  I bought the black version; I think my days of jumping around and sweating while playing are over, so I probably won't worry about running colors (but I will keep an eye out for such a thing)"}
{"source": "  It's very adjustable (just not quickly adjustable), worked perfectly with my Straplocks, and keeps my 45 pound (it seems like it, anyway) Les Paul from digging into my shoulder"}
{"source": "  The 2"}
{"source": "5 inch width is fine for me, but if you're spending long hours strapped to a heavy monster, I'd go up to the 3 inch model, especially if you're going to be bouncing around for the greater part of 5 hours"}
{"source": "this strap works fine on my Fender Strat"}
{"source": "  it is reasonably comfortable"}
{"source": "  I was disappointed in that it does not fit the pegs of my Zager acoustic"}
{"source": "  otherwise,  it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap"}
{"source": "This is an excellent strap"}
{"source": "This particular strap replaces a 2 inch wide model that I've had for at least 10 years"}
{"source": "  That is a great strap and has held up wonderfully"}
{"source": "  I fully expect this strap to match my old one for durability"}
{"source": "So why the new strap?* By not using strap locks the area around the strap button holes is much looser than a new one would be"}
{"source": "  Since I recently bought a new guitar I wanted a more secure strap without going fully to strap locks"}
{"source": " So far so good"}
{"source": "* Wider"}
{"source": "  I wanted to see if a half inch difference in width made a difference"}
{"source": "  Boy does it ever, the new 2"}
{"source": "5 strap is really much more comfortable than my old 2 inch model"}
{"source": "  It isn't a miracle, but it definitely is noticeable with my 9lb Les Paul"}
{"source": "A consideration: This is suede and will fuzz for the first little while"}
{"source": "  If that is an issue for you I would avoid this suede strap, and probably suede in general"}
{"source": "  After these strap break in though they are very soft and supple"}
{"source": "Highly recommended for confort and durability"}
{"source": "What a nice strap! It's a really beautiful deep brown color that really harmonizes with the reddish mahogany back and sides of my dreadnought"}
{"source": "The whole strap is leather--no adjustment hardware to scratch your instrument"}
{"source": " It took me a little while to get used to this method, but now I don't even think of it"}
{"source": " The main strap has several slots cut into it, and there's another piece that threads through the slots and then doubles back over itself to lock into place"}
{"source": " It's simple and very secure"}
{"source": " It makes adjusting the strap length a bit of a pain, but how often do you adjust your strap length once you've gotten it set? I almost never do"}
{"source": "It's an affordable strap that looks elegant, is wide enough to be comfortable with an acoustic guitar, has great length adjustment range, and rolls up to fit in the case"}
{"source": " I had to slightly enlarge one of the holes in order to make it fit the strapjack for my guitar--I have a pickup system installed, and the end button is a bit bigger than a standard strap button"}
{"source": " Ten seconds with a sharp knife and my strap now fits perfectly"}
{"source": " I would buy it again"}
{"source": "Got the black one"}
{"source": "  Bought this to help hold up my heavy Sheraton II and needed something at least 2 inches wide and strong to do it"}
{"source": "  On that level this strap succeeds"}
{"source": " It is definitely strong enough to keep my guitar from falling off or shifting on my shoulder"}
{"source": "  It also looks very nice"}
{"source": "But any positive thoughts I have about it are outweighed by the constant shedding of black dyed leather that continually falls off the strap and onto me, my guitar, my carpets, etc"}
{"source": "I need things like guitar straps to be ready to USE without causing a shower of little leather bits all over the place!  I am not sure how long this will go on but I've been using it for two weeks now and there is a trail of small black leather wherever I go"}
{"source": "  I have not encountered the dye running yet"}
{"source": "Honestly if I had it to do over, I would skip this particular strap"}
{"source": " Suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment"}
{"source": "This is my thrid Levy's strap and it is as good as the rest of them that I have had for a few years"}
{"source": " I have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others"}
{"source": " I have seen on different sites that the dye is thin but I don't see a problem with it so far and I use it regularly"}
{"source": " I have it adjusted to the largest size and wished they were a bit longer, but it is a standard size"}
{"source": "I prefer this strap over other cheap leather straps because of the build quality and the fact that they are made in Canada and not china or somewhere oversees with cheaper materials"}
{"source": " For the price, the strap works well and I would buy more Levy's straps if needed"}
{"source": "i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people"}
{"source": "  The strap is about 6\" too short for my Seagull S6 guitar"}
{"source": "  I will say the build quality is great but too short, is and remains, too short"}
{"source": "  I will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap"}
{"source": "  I just can't understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short"}
{"source": "2/22/2013 I fired off an email to LEVY and the long and \"short\" of all this is you will have to fork over another $30 to buy an extendo for this strap"}
{"source": " I don't quite understand why they don't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place"}
{"source": "  here's a link to the extendo optionLEVY'S LEATHERS MMGXL-2"}

{"source": "5  the irony here is I managed to buy the last one for the immediate future"}
{"source": "This is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider"}
{"source": " I got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now I have this cobbled up looking guitar strap"}
{"source": " It's sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other"}
{"source": "  I will keep this strap but sure feel like I've been had on this purchase"}
{"source": " the terms bait and switch come to my mind"}
{"source": "Price is great"}
{"source": " Works perfect"}
{"source": " Comfortable, and looks sharp"}
{"source": " Not the least bit stiff like some leather products"}
{"source": " My first experience with Levy, and completely satisfied"}
{"source": " Thank you"}
{"source": " Wayne"}
{"source": "First the goods: Sturdy leather construction just cant be beat"}
{"source": " the color is spot on with the pictures shown"}
{"source": "The Bads: It's a bit short, I have it on acoustic guitar that the forward mount is the &#34;shoe lace around the head stock&#34; method, I had to max this strap out to make the span"}
{"source": " I'm a bigger guy, so a smaller person shouldn't have this problem"}
{"source": " Then there's the whole friction of suede on clothing thing I hadn't considered"}
{"source": " It drags and pulls your shirt really bad, making it a bit of a pain to get the guitar on a positioned where you want it to hang"}
{"source": " That problem is not specific to this strap, but the material its made out of"}
{"source": " It's high quality, but I didn't consider it trying to pull my shirt off"}
{"source": " If had to do over again, I'd pass"}
{"source": "Width and padding are good for Heavier guitar (currently being used on a Les Paul)"}
{"source": " Finish, stitching, and adjustments are quality"}
{"source": "The only issue I had was needing super human strength to push onto the strap pegs"}
{"source": "You might want to unscrew and screw pegs back on with the strap in place"}
{"source": "But that means the guitar is very secure, so I am very happy"}
{"source": "Study strap"}
{"source": " Great feel, leather matches my instrument well"}
{"source": " 2-1/2&#34; width worked well for me compared to the 4&#34; version"}
{"source": "Heavy construction in layered leather"}
{"source": "There is no pressure on the shoulder and it is very expensive looking"}
{"source": "I will buy another in a second color"}
{"source": "This is hands down the most comfortable strap I own"}
{"source": "  I am pretty sure it is really a bass strap but I use it on my electric guitars and it is superbly comfortable"}
{"source": "  Not cheap but keep looking to see if there is a sale or a demo model"}
{"source": "  Worth the wait"}
{"source": "If you are playing a guitar that costs several hundreds to several thousand dollars, why would anyone buy a cheap guitar strap to hold it up"}
{"source": " I have friends who think strap-locks are the best invention of the century but, I believe in buying a quality guitar strap & Levy's produces some of the best on the market"}
{"source": " I own several acoustic & electric guitars"}
{"source": " for the most part, I have a strap for each one except the pieces too valuable to take to a gig"}
{"source": " Every strap is a Levy's"}
{"source": "I'll call myself a veteran pro guitarist (I don't believe in using the word \"old\") who gigs about 12 - 15 days a month"}
{"source": " This strap is comfortable to wear & strong enough to hold up my Gibson Les Paul Standard without any worries of dropping it"}
{"source": " I've watched friends & band-mates constantly adjusting or reattaching their straps"}
{"source": " I offer my advise to buy a quality strap & find most continue to use crap straps"}
{"source": " BUY IT"}
{"source": " You will love it!"}
{"source": "Phantom power supplies aren't very sexy items, but they're extremely important if you want to use condensor microphones"}
{"source": " This Nady box is dead quiet and works like a charm"}
{"source": " Totally no-frills, rock solid metal construction and you can't hear it at all"}
{"source": "This daisy chain worked very well for me - no problems yet"}
{"source": " I'm powering about six pedals currently, and I am able to use more than one without any problems or change in sound"}
{"source": " I think this is a great way to power some basic effects without breaking the bank, and it should work with any single spot A/C adapter you might already have, so no need to buy another"}
{"source": "I ordered this plug because it is advertised as a &#34;1 Spot&#34; brand plug"}
{"source": " It is not what I received"}
{"source": " Instead I received a generic plug  for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose, but a really cheap version"}
{"source": " The plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 Spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic"}
{"source": " The original 1 Spot plug has much smaller plugs, great for saving space on a pedal board, and the wires are soft and &#34;rubbery&#34;, again making it easier to work with on a pedal board, specially if you're working with a pedal board like Pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars"}
{"source": " I informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one"}
{"source": " In my email to them I included an image of the original packaging of the 1 Spot 8 Plug to make sure there would be no mistake, but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug"}
{"source": " I emailed them again for a refund, which they promptly did"}
{"source": " I can say, that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money"}
{"source": " I imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 Spot plug, wouldn't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors"}
{"source": " I strongly recommend, spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 Spot 8 Plug"}
{"source": "This cable expands the capability of the One-Spot or Godlyke 9V adapter"}
{"source": " The quality is very good and the length between plugs is more than adequate for most pedal boards"}
{"source": "I have 2 one spots which came with the 5 multi plug cable, after reading a little bit on the internet I read that the one spots can handle almost 10 pedals each (depends on the pedal, power handling etc"}
{"source": ") So I saw they had an 8 plug cable and figured I would try it out"}
{"source": " With adding many more pedals to my board, this is perfect"}
{"source": " Def recommend if you have alot of pedals and only want to plug in once"}
{"source": "nice good like fine great fantastic like love nice good like love happy peppy perky free i do i do i do"}
{"source": "The chorus effect is a little weak"}
{"source": " I use it now to get sort of a leslie effect"}
{"source": " Clean the effect is a little weak"}
{"source": " The adjustment knobs don't seem to do much either"}
{"source": "I love this pedal! That said I would like to address some of the reviews I see on here"}
{"source": " I have been playing guitar since I was 14 years old"}
{"source": " I am now 57 so I have a few years of experience"}
{"source": " First you guys who complain about the plastic housing"}
{"source": " Are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals? If you are stop doing it"}
{"source": " All you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works"}
{"source": " The plastic housing is extremely strong and won't bust when used properly"}
{"source": " The next thing I would like to address is the battery running down &#34;even when it's turned off&#34;"}
{"source": " Every effects pedal I ever owned would run the battery down if you leave your guitar plugged in when not playing it"}
{"source": " Get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain"}
{"source": " It will save you a fortune"}
{"source": " The ones saying the sound sucked, buy something besides a $50 amp, and learn where to put the chorus in the pedal chain"}
{"source": " Thi is a good pedal and I've used it on stage for 2 years without a problem"}
{"source": " That means I have spent about $11 a year for a pedal that has earned me Thousands! Buy one, learn how to use it and you'll be happy"}
{"source": "First Behringer pedal I have returned"}
{"source": " Almost no effect provided by pedal"}
{"source": " I have returned the unit"}
{"source": " Not worth it"}
{"source": " Lousy pedal"}
{"source": "For the money (CHEAP!), this is worth getting"}
{"source": " The loop feature is quite good, the delay/echo entirely satisfactory"}
{"source": " Not as good as, say, a BOSS unit, but they cost 5x as much"}
{"source": " Great for everything from slapback to long delay, with heap-big repeats available"}
{"source": " The plastic housing might not stand-up to the road"}
{"source": " Having the 9v adapter input on the side behind the in jack, rather than the back, seems wise"}
{"source": " I've read some negative press about Behringer pedals, but personally cannot complain"}
{"source": "Pretty much a straight up clone of the Boss pedal- and a decent one at that"}
{"source": " Not the bulletproof construction of the boss to be sure, but all the functions are the same"}
{"source": " This is not true bypass but neither is the Boss"}
{"source": " I have not experienced the tone-suck or buzzing that others have complained about"}
{"source": " Mine worked flawlessly out of the box and does a great job thickening up my leads in a Gilmour or EJ way"}
{"source": " Is this the best digital delay on the market? Surely not, but it's the best cheap one"}
{"source": " The pedal features up to 2 seconds of delay and a tap tempo function, however the instructions do not tell you how to engage the tap function(hold the pedal down)"}
{"source": " Believe me, you figure it out at this price point"}
{"source": " If you want to spend double the price ($70- still cheap for a delay~), I would suggest the Ibanez DE7"}
{"source": " Incidentally- this pedal- like any other digital delay or digital reverb- will EAT batteries"}
{"source": " It's what they do, and is not a flaw related to this specific pedal"}
{"source": " Invest in a daisy chain (SPOT or the like"}
{"source": ") If you have a pedal train with multiple stomp boxes and you are running them via 9 volt it's a no-brainer"}
{"source": "for the price and options u can not beat this pedal, i just sound great with acoustic or electric guitar"}
{"source": " thank u guys your pedals really kick butt!"}
{"source": "WOW!!!!! this thing is fun to play with!!!this is my first delay pedal, so i cant compare it with others, but im so happy that i bought it! ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day"}
{"source": "  you can tweak the echo in 100's of different ways"}
{"source": "the case seems to be sturdy and looks like it will last quite a while as long as i dont get over zelous and stomp on it too hard"}
{"source": " im very happy with this product and im becoming a real fan of behringer products"}
{"source": "This is simply one of the best pedal boards out there"}
{"source": " It is very well made, resistant, tough and very flexible as you can adapt a wide variety of power suplies and keep your pedals in great shape"}
{"source": " Looks good too"}
{"source": " I would recommend to get a few roles of power-grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the 'industrial' velcro included, especially if you have a combination of both regular size (MXR or Boss) and bigger pedals like a Cry Baby or a VOX Satchurator or Time-Machine Reverb"}
{"source": " If thinking of purchasing one of these, you would probably have a few thousand dollares invested in pedals, so this would be great for you to keep them protected and organized"}
{"source": " Now, if you are on the road for long, I would suggest to get the hard case instead of the soft case"}
{"source": " For eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok"}
{"source": "is all I can say"}
{"source": " I got the unit, opened up the softcase and pulled out the nice black powder coated aluminum pedal board and"}
{"source": "WOW there is a lot of space on this thing"}
{"source": " Do I think the price is fair for a piece of welded aluminum and what is basically a re-branded 'Gator' nylon bag"}
{"source": " No"}
{"source": " Its over priced considering thats all you get plus some plastic ties and velcro"}
{"source": " However, when I factor in the laziness of not wanting to build my own board, suddenly one hundred fifty bucks seems like a decent trade"}
{"source": " I was a littel disappointed to see the cheap-o rubber feet, my guess is they will be missing in about 6 months but, I have learned to fix those"}
{"source": " Specifically the product is solid as welded aluminum should be and the soft case feels rugged"}
{"source": "we'll see"}
{"source": " Again, my only gripe is with the price considering there is no other mounting system other than velcro, at least that comes with it, and no intergrated power supply"}
{"source": " However, if you need a lot of pedal space (read the dimensions!) and the heft of welded aluminum, this may be the last pedal board you buy"}
{"source": " Did I mention this thing is freggin' huge? Minus one star for a little price gouging"}
{"source": "I love this capo"}
{"source": " Let me tell you about my capo journey where I've used every brand while searching for this one"}
{"source": " First, I always owned the old Dunlop Toggle Action capo which is just old tech, you know, where it's just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber, the kind one used to use before 1980"}
{"source": " I had to go back to that when my first Planet Waves black THERMOPLASTIC capo broke"}
{"source": " Don't buy those if you live in a damp climate like CA"}
{"source": " Each one I bought broke, one broke within a week, during the winter rainy days"}
{"source": " So I loved those capos, they were perfect, but I was done with the breaking, so I figured I'd try others instead despite my love for the Planet Waves design (I didn't know about the silver aluminum one yet)"}
{"source": " Well, I hated each other one I tried"}
{"source": " Kyser, if you have had carpal and/or are small handed, you know what I mean, you don't want a capo that involves squeezing really hard so that your hands are in pain and then you don't want to play the guitar"}
{"source": " I really hate the Kysers (I know some folks love to squeeze and use them, that's fine, different strokes right)"}
{"source": " Then I tried the Schub, you have to be kidding me"}
{"source": " OMG that thing is so ridiculous, it pops off, it wiggles about, it is tricky, I hate it"}
{"source": " Now, I know many folks are Schub fans who give me a drive by downrate, I'm not saying it isn't great for those who love it"}
{"source": " If you love the Schub, you love it unconditionally, and I respect that, all I'm saying is that design is not for me and many other folks like me"}
{"source": " There are other models that fail similarly to these 2, they make you squeeze so hard it does hurt for those like myself with sensitive hands, like the G7, I did fall in love with it until maybe the 5th squeezing and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueezing it apart to put it back on"}
{"source": " Awk~ward and painful"}
{"source": " Sorry to be such a softie and a crybaby, but if you have carpal, you know what I mean, you want to go easy on the hands and arms, and not brutalize them"}
{"source": " The other thing I've always hated about the Kysers (and again it may be that my smaller physique is involved) is how it gets in the way so chording with a capo is a lot harder"}
{"source": " That's just dumb"}
{"source": " Kyser lovers either accept that as a challenge or don't mind it or claim it doesn't do that, but you know what I'm talking about"}
{"source": " Ok, so then because of all the broken Planet Waves thermoplastic capos, I turned next to Dunlop's turnscrew models"}
{"source": " I liked them, they are very similar to the PW design, but the screw location is more awkward to use, and turning their screws is a lot harder on the fingers (got the ripped and pained fingertips to show for it)"}
{"source": " So, I turned back in search for a better Planet Waves model"}
{"source": " This is it, right here"}
{"source": " The silver one is excellent, and it's made of aluminum, not thermoplastic"}
{"source": " I bought one and it has lasted me almost 3 years now without a single problem"}
{"source": " By now, in contrast, I would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplastic ones"}
{"source": " I want to say that if you are performing in a public venue, never use the thermoplastic ones, because my thermoplastic ones dramatically burst and flew across the room, and could easily \"poke someone's eyes out\""}
{"source": " Not kidding, don't use those in public situations"}
{"source": " Back to the excellent aluminum silver PWaves capo"}
{"source": " I love it, because it doesn't break, not at all, and has all of the great thermoplastic model features that make it the best capo ever (especially for us sensitive folks with carpal or small handed people etc)"}
{"source": " The great features are:1"}
{"source": " Ease of use and easy fitting are perfect, the best of all capos"}
{"source": " This capo fits so easily"}
{"source": " Simply put it on the fretboard and the location of the screw is perfect-- you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a couple inches, unlike the other screwtops or all other capos, there's no need for any moving around, adjusting the guitar, falling down due to balance issues and then chasing a falling guitar, sheesh none of that nonsense"}
{"source": " You put it on and they've engineered it brilliantly so you can easily get it on, move it from fret to fret, put it where you want, and screw it in with great ease! Wow, best ever in this category"}
{"source": " Ease of use is tops, ever!2"}
{"source": " It will never hurt you, it only helps"}
{"source": " It weighs nothing, is easy to carry, you can slip it onto the peg area, it just is so light"}
{"source": " I still can't believe how light it feels"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " It does what it's supposed to, that other capos don't do"}
{"source": " No issues with being in tune, just screw it in to the level of tightness you desire, no wrestling around like some capos do"}
{"source": " The screw is in the most easy location, and the screw itself is nicely made so it doesn't hurt your fingers at all when you screw and unscrew, it's a breeze"}
{"source": " No problems with the size, it's so small, it doesn't get in your way on the fretboard"}
{"source": " You won't have to do hand yoga in order to play capo'd songs, it is FLAT (I know, what a concept!)"}
{"source": " A capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords, not pretzeled twister instead of chords"}
{"source": " Now, I play capo'd songs all the time because of this capo, and it is so much fun musically, a whole new magical experience"}
{"source": " The truth I've found is that good equipment matters in music making (I never played acoustic guitar as well or as much until I got my first Applause guitar with great action"}
{"source": " I have a Yamaha I love now (since the Applause necks break), but both guitars taught me that you have to have good equipment that's easy to use (in the case of guitars, great action is imperative"}
{"source": " In the case of capos, ease of use and no pain produced is imperative, and it opens up the world of capo use, the magic of the mathematics of music theory"}
{"source": ")If you love the other brands, don't diss me, I know it's perfect for you, and I'm happy for you that it works perfectly for you, because when you have the best one for you, you will shine with your music and I will enjoy listening to you play"}
{"source": " But those of you who have sensitive or small hands or have carpal know what I'm talking about, you won't settle for the torture of Kysers and Schubs, gotta be kidding me"}
{"source": " I bought every capo imaginable (need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile) but ended up that I was using the old toggle type again instead until I found the aluminum Silver Planet Waves Capo"}
{"source": " Planet Waves has made the perfect capo now, no more issues, just easy fun playing capo'd songs"}
{"source": " Again, only buy the Silver model, because when/if you get silver, you are guaranteed to get aluminum, not thermoplastic"}
{"source": "Capos are a funny thing, there are some that work great and many that aren't so great"}
{"source": "  My capos include, Bird of Paridise, Paige, and Kyser"}
{"source": "  This is a very fast and easy capo to use, the tension adjustment is fast and easy"}
{"source": " If you need an all around capo for a six string guitar, this is it"}
{"source": "Sound is not so good"}
{"source": " Strange how the gain has to be turned up along with the volume to hear anything"}
{"source": "I used AC30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these"}
{"source": "Sound quality of AC30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrendous clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings"}
{"source": "For people worried about CONSTRUCTION, these turned out to be very sturdy (AC30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same)"}
{"source": "Even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy AC30, the latter has acceptable cleans"}
{"source": "I'm a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything I play"}
{"source": " I however, am having a ball playing as loud as I want with as much or as little gain as I feel like at the moment with my Classic Rock Guitar Headphone Amp"}
{"source": " My Rickenbacker 360 sounds just the way I want, with as much clarity or with all the &#34;smoke&#34; as I feel like dialing in for now"}
{"source": " It is SO nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in, put in my ear buds, and practice for a while anywhere I want, anytime I want"}
{"source": " Downside: I wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size Vox amp and the controls are small/hard to read but easy to learn"}
{"source": " You do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time"}
{"source": " Solution: Hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive"}
{"source": " I plan to pick up other versions of the amPlug from Vox to extend my fun"}
{"source": " This was a good choice"}
{"source": " Buy one!"}
{"source": "I bought the Vox Amplug AC30 and loved it so much, it probably doubled (or tripled) the amount of time I play guitar"}
{"source": "  I loved it so much I went out and got the more expensive (by $10) Joe Satriani Signature Amplug"}
{"source": "  I liked the Satriani model also because it covered a different tonal range than the AC30, and delay feature is a lot of fun"}
{"source": "  But I had serious questions about the Classic Rock Amplug"}
{"source": "  Why did have only a 4-star review on Amazon - among the lowest for any of the fabulous Amplug products"}
{"source": "  Would it be only a \"one trick pony\"?Well, I have to tell you, I was completely blown away by how great the Classic Rock Amplug is, and I'm now even more blown away by some of these negative reviews"}
{"source": "  I've tried out a number of effects pedals for plugging into an actual guitar amplifier, and many pedal users are seeking what they call a \"Marshall-in-a-box\""}
{"source": "  In other words, they want a effects pedal that will single-handedly transform whatever amp they have into the sound of a miniaturized stack of Marshalls"}
{"source": "  Believe it or not, the Vox Classic Rock on higher gain settings is about as close to a \"Marshall\" sound as I can imagine"}
{"source": "  And it comes in a small, plastic headphone amplifier that runs on 2 AAA batteries and costs all of $39"}
{"source": "99"}
{"source": "Functionally, the Classic Rock Amplug is the same as the AC30 - three dials for gain, tone, and volume, an aux in jack (for MP3 players), a headphone jack, and an on/off switch"}
{"source": "  But that's where the similarities end"}
{"source": "  While the excellent AC30 model simulates the boxy, sparkly sound of a tube amplifier, the Classic Rock packs some PUNCH"}
{"source": "  The low end presence on this thing (even through a $20 set of entry-level Sony headphones from Target) is significantly greater than on the AC30"}
{"source": "  More importantly, the sound doesn't deteriorate with higher volumes"}
{"source": "  There are plenty of ways you can try to play guitar through headphones, but most of them become a static-filled mess as soon as you turn up the volume"}
{"source": "  Amazingly, the tiny Amplug has plenty of power on tap, and the \"overdrive\" is controlled through analog circuitry, with amazing clarity"}
{"source": "But the real surprise in the Classic Rock Amplug (and the point upon which I disagree with several other reviewers here) are the clean and slightly overdrive tones as you roll back on the gain knob"}
{"source": "  Several reviewers referred to the clean tones as weak, or claimed that there were no clean tones"}
{"source": "  Yet, with both my Les Paul and a Strat, I was able to set the Volume at around 6-8 and the gain at about level 2 and get a very nice clean tone without loss of volume"}
{"source": "  If any dirt was remaining, a slight rollback on the guitar volume further cured the problem"}
{"source": "  Even better, playing a Strat into the Classic Rock with the gain set somewhere between 2 to 4 actually created a Tubescreamer-like blues tone!  This tone was one of the audio demos offered on Vox's website, but I didn't believe it for myself until I plugged the Classic Rock in and dialed in that tone"}
{"source": "Long story short, the Classic Rock is extremely powerful, but more verstaile than I thought"}
{"source": "  It can do the high-gain Marshall tones I expected, but also offers a wide array of clean or slightly-overdriven tones"}
{"source": "  It might even be more versatile than the AC30 Amplug, though I remain pretty loyal to the AC30"}
{"source": "  The good news is that the two models are different enough and cheap enough that you can own both"}
{"source": "  Highly recommend the Classic Rock - 5 stars"}
{"source": "Cable crackles when plug in jack is moved"}
{"source": " GLS brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison"}
{"source": " Both have tweed jackets however the Hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the GLS cable does"}
{"source": " I would recommend the GLS product over the Hosa product"}
{"source": "I like it, got it fast and it is just the right length for my at home personal use"}
{"source": "  Thanks for getting it to me so fast, and I recommend going through the vendor I received this from it works great"}
{"source": "I like tweed jacket cables because they are hard to get tangled up and are easier to identify than having a bunch of standard black cables everywhere"}
{"source": " I use the right angle side to go into my effects pedal board and the other side to go into my guitar"}
{"source": " The right angle is nice because it's low profile and fits perfectly on my board, even when I put it in it's travel case"}
{"source": " Everything seems well built here and has been working for months without any problem"}
{"source": "the cable hisses, crackles and pops right out of the package"}
{"source": "  save your money and buy a better cable"}
{"source": "  i will buy cables locally from now on so i can easily return them if they are defective"}
{"source": "  i would definitely not buy this product again or recommend it to anyone else"}
{"source": "I love this cable"}
{"source": " I don't get any buzz when I hook up my bass and it can handle anything I throw at it"}
{"source": " The sound quality is amazing"}
{"source": "Hands down the best cable I have ever owned"}
{"source": " I was spending money on cheaper cables continuously and now I spend that money on other stuff"}
{"source": " I play one to five hours a day and have used this same cable for 3 or 4 months"}
{"source": " Well worth the money"}
{"source": " Lifetime guarantee to boot"}
{"source": " Definitely will buy Mogami from now on"}
{"source": "Yes, you are paying a little extra for peace of mind and the reputation of Mogami gold quality"}
{"source": " I found this to be a good investment if you are meticulous about your sound"}
{"source": " Compared to my old cable, the Mogami Gold produced a more transparent sound"}
{"source": " you might have to do a side by side comparison to get the idea"}
{"source": " When recording guitar, I am able to clearly hear individual strings while playing overdriven chords"}
{"source": " No matter your playing style, this cable will work well with your sound"}
{"source": "Bought several of these and they worked fine"}
{"source": " I later moved on to Planet Waves for my custom pedal board because I could get the lengths perfect"}
{"source": "This cable is built to last"}
{"source": " Overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly"}
{"source": " What more could you ask for"}
{"source": "Without going over the fiscal cliff these cables worked very well in my 7-pedal guitar effect lineup"}
{"source": "No noticeable hiss, hum or buzzing"}
{"source": " Clean & quiet"}
{"source": "Good buy for the price"}
{"source": "It's well make and cheap compare with other product on Amazon nowadays market"}
{"source": " I"}
{"source": "I do replace it for guitar cable, work fine, I'm happy with this unit"}
{"source": " Recommend to someone need replace cable jct"}
{"source": "I bought this cables to use it on my guitar pedals during practices and live gigs"}
{"source": " I have no complains about it at this time"}
{"source": " I own and use other hosa products and i think that they are making products with an excellent quality for a lower price"}
{"source": "100% recomended"}
{"source": "I am normally a guitarist in my band, but I have found myself at times needing to play the keys also"}
{"source": " Having two instruments to play, a pedalboard, and mic stand is a lot of real estate on the stage, so this adapter made things MUCH better for me when I find myself back in that position"}
{"source": " Works great with my On Stage Keyboard Stand"}
{"source": " If you play keys and are also a vocalist, this is a must! Worth every penny"}
{"source": "The vibrations produced at touching piano keys are transmitted to the microphone"}
{"source": " It now rest at bottom of a box"}
{"source": "I have mine attached to one of the support arms on myOn Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Stand"}
{"source": " While this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports, I was unable to use it with anOn Stage 2 Tier Folding Z Keyboard Standeven with the top tier removed"}
{"source": " The reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube, and had it mated, the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard"}
{"source": "When attached to theOn Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Standwith anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Blackattached to the top screw-in post that perfectly mates with the boom, this attachment bar/boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard I use (aRoland RD-300NX Digital Stage Pianoor aRoland V-combo 76 Key Stage Keyboard)"}
{"source": "Bottom line, make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar (according to the manufacturer it will work with most X-style stands), and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted"}
{"source": " The total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 7"}
{"source": "5\""}
{"source": "  If your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar + boom or other mic holder to clear, you can gain an additional 3\" with aShure A26X 3\" Mic Mount Extension Tube"}
{"source": "As I've heard with the Pyle Pro amps, I received mine today, and it was defective"}
{"source": " Only one channel worked, and it definitely looked like it took a beating before it arrived at my doorstep"}
{"source": " The packaging was very good though, so I'm  thinking this looks like a refurb/used, and they listed it as new"}
{"source": " Already printed the return shipping label, and it will head back to the Amazon warehouse on Monday"}
{"source": "This amp did a good job for its rating"}
{"source": " It was my backup amp for a QSC GX5"}
{"source": " I sold it after using it for about a year or so"}
{"source": "It's rubber and you can slip it under the strings and into the sound hole"}
{"source": "with a little effort"}
{"source": " It might even be over &#34;engineered&#34;, it fits so well"}
{"source": "This cover does not fit a full size acoustic/electric Hohner guitar"}
{"source": "  I measured the whole at 3 7/8&#34;, but this cover does not even come close to fitting!  It measures 4 1/6&#34; in diameter, so check your guitar closely!"}
{"source": "it barely did anything but i guess thats because im the one playing the guitar, if you were in another room im am sure that it would make a difference"}
{"source": "Doesn't reduce sound worth a darn"}
{"source": "  I thought plugging the sound hole would muffle things"}
{"source": "  Muddies it up a bit maybe, but not really a reduction in dB"}
{"source": "It does the job though"}
{"source": " I wasn't impressed by the lack of range, but then again I've never found a use for the more extreme settings on a phaser anyways"}
{"source": " It seems that this unit keeps the effect within a safe and comfortable range and that's okay with me"}
{"source": "I'm very happy with this pedal"}
{"source": "  It seems to be a knock off of the MXR phase pedal, being that it provides a nice classic, subtle phase effect"}
{"source": "  You can flip the switch to \"swirl\" for a more pronounced effect, but I love just keeping it mild"}
{"source": "The metal switch/button to engage the pedal doesn't have the \"click\" that many pedals do"}
{"source": "  I actually prefer this"}
{"source": "  The \"click\" effects wear out sooner"}
{"source": "  Some of my high end pedals also use this smooth, click-less way of engaging a pedal"}
{"source": "  You'll know it's on by the tone change and the bright led light"}
{"source": "  IMHO, you don't need a click switch"}
{"source": "The sounds are clean and smooth, clear and bright, and all the other adjectives you could use to describe a great phase effect"}
{"source": "Quality and Value, all the way"}
{"source": "As a huge Gilmour fan, it was a no brainer to pick these strings up"}
{"source": "  Had been playing DR and Elixer for the past couple of years and  to my recollection,  have never tried ghs"}
{"source": "  This custom gauge set plays great"}
{"source": "  They tuned right up with very little stretching"}
{"source": "  I will buy these again!!!"}
{"source": "Simple review here"}
{"source": "Good Strings help create Good Sound!!!These are nice strings and on a quality instrument stay in tune well"}
{"source": " They are not overly bright nor dark but rather have a nice \"round\" sound to them"}
{"source": " Highly recommend"}
{"source": "These strings are as advertised"}
{"source": "  Nice tone and good quality"}
{"source": "  Can't remember the last time I've found a bad string from a set of these"}
{"source": "  Actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar"}
{"source": "  Got the high tension ones for a shorter scale instrument so they wouldn't be too sloppy at concert pitch"}
{"source": "Solidly built works just as a mic stand should"}
{"source": "couldnt be happier"}
{"source": "As long as I take care of this Ill never need to buy a new one again"}
{"source": "I just used this for a gig on Monday "}
{"source": " it's solid, well built, nothing loose or floppy, it stands up straight (extending to almost 7 feet tall), it folds up easily, and is nice and compact when folded "}
{"source": " good enough for me"}
{"source": "One further note, when I ordered this, I was thinking that I would be able to just unscrew the vertical section from my round heavy base (which is also an \"On Stage\") and screw it into this tripod "}
{"source": " that's not the case, as the vertical piece here is integral to the tripod base"}
{"source": "  I'm not unhappy though, this stand works quite well"}
{"source": "I have both the Fostex PM0"}
{"source": "5 MKII and the BX5a Deluxe for a while now"}
{"source": "  While the BX5a tends to get higher review rating and is more popular, I personally prefer the PM0"}
{"source": "5 due to its having more bass & volume"}
{"source": "  Both models cost about the same, with the PM0"}
{"source": "5 roughly $20 cheaper"}
{"source": "The PM0"}
{"source": "5 is bigger, heavier, has a heat sink in the back, with a combo XLR/TRS jack"}
{"source": "  While the BX5a has a bigger tweeter, separate XLR & TRS jacks"}
{"source": "  Construction-wise, both are well-made"}
{"source": "  If you plan to share the same monitor between 2 difference sources, then the separate input of the BX5a is more convenient (you can always get a Y-adapter to support 2 inputs on the PM0"}
{"source": "5)"}
{"source": "The BX5a has more clarity & boosted details, but is more on a tinny side"}
{"source": "  The PM0"}
{"source": "5 has more boom but less treble"}
{"source": "  I guess the difference is due to the size of the tweeter and the length of the bass port (the BX5a has larger tweeter & 1 rear bass port, while the PM0"}
{"source": "5 has 2 front bass ports)"}
{"source": "  Sounds coming out of the PM0"}
{"source": "5 resemble more of the ambience of my car & home stereo than the BX5a"}
{"source": "For my home-studio purpose, I like the warmer sound of the PM0"}
{"source": "5 more"}
{"source": "  I do use them to watch movie once in a while, and the PM0"}
{"source": "5 is more suitable as the main speakers, while the BX5a is better placed for surround speakers"}
{"source": "For further references, I have placed audio samples of a song I wrote & arranged (so there won't be any copyright violation issue), re-recorded with an AKG C414B condenser mic, placed at same height as the tweeter, normalized to -15dB"}
{"source": "  Hope they'll help making your choice easier (instead of having to buy both like I did :)["}

{"source": "My old pair of JBL Studio Pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost"}
{"source": " At the time, mid 1990's, these were the best you could expect for computer monitors"}
{"source": " I do mixing and voice overs, so I needed the real deal"}
{"source": " After extensive research and listening, I decided on the M-Audio BX5a deluxe"}
{"source": " For the price they can not be beat! Punchy crisp bass, smooth highs and great mid range"}
{"source": " They are also very accurate, I hear things just the way they are recorded"}
{"source": " They also bring to light subtleties in old CD's that I have never heard before! Also the wood construction, gives these speakers a warmer resonance than others made out of plastic or metal"}
{"source": " If you have a studio on a budget, and need the best speakers for under $500"}
{"source": "00, buy these"}
{"source": " Remember, they are studio monitors, so the audio is going to be very directional, so use them for monitors"}
{"source": " Great speakers for portables, like an Ipod"}
{"source": " One note, you need a really good sound card to get the most from these babies!"}
{"source": "I bought these as a solution to obtain feedback while recording my guitar through my computer"}
{"source": " That solution was successful"}
{"source": " These speakers put out enough power that I can maintain the clarity of my guitar tone fairly well and achieve feedback almost as easily as i do with my amp"}
{"source": " I have a 75Watt amp that powers a 12\" celestion speaker"}
{"source": " These monitors have 70Watts powering a 5\" Woofer and a 1\" Tweeter, 40W/30W respectively"}
{"source": " Slight drop in the power output, but they are beefy enough that I don't really notice"}
{"source": "The isolation pads they come with are paper thin, almost pointless"}
{"source": " If you really need some, get some more substantial pads"}
{"source": " The back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours"}
{"source": " not really concerned about that, but it's worth mentioning"}
{"source": "They have great sound, excellent low end, lots of clarity throughout"}
{"source": " They are pricey, but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon"}
{"source": " I would really recommend not going to a retailer"}
{"source": " even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online"}
{"source": " Only go to a store just to hear them and compare them with other monitors"}
{"source": "Sound nice, but very unreliable BX5a Deluxe"}
{"source": "I own a pair of YAMAHA NS 10s and EVENT 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use"}
{"source": "2 years ago I purchased a set of regular BX5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked"}
{"source": "I just replaced them with the BX5a Deluxe model, and after only one week"}
{"source": " one of the Internal amps will no longer power up"}
{"source": "I need a pair of affordable AV shielded monitors that I can depend on, and these Cheap M-Audio Monitors are not it"}
{"source": "I am back to using my 20-20's with slight AV noise until I find a decent AV shielded monitor"}
{"source": "M-Audio was a much better company before Avid took them over!"}
{"source": "I've only been using the yellow one so far (only just started using them)"}
{"source": " But I like how the grip is strong cause of the rubber and the grooves"}
{"source": " The colors and designs are pretty"}
{"source": " As far as I can tell they are all the same width/thickness"}
{"source": " For some reason I thought they'd have different thicknesses from a previous review"}
{"source": " And so far I haven't lost any, yay!"}
{"source": "These Dava picks are very nice"}
{"source": " They are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick"}
{"source": "The rubber grip area is great"}
{"source": " The feel is soft, just perfect for holding a long time"}
{"source": " The Dunlop picks with the bumps are nice, but this just feels a lot better between my fingers"}
{"source": "There are three little lines at the center of the pick, the bottom line is supposed to be less flex and the top line is supposed to have more flex"}
{"source": " This is really hard to position my fingers on exactly the spots and there isn't much of an effect no matter where I place my fingers"}
{"source": " The effect is subtle at best"}
{"source": "The only criticism is the tip is a little bit too short; the rubber can end up striking the string"}
{"source": "Overall, I like these picks a lot"}
{"source": " The colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand"}
{"source": "I have tryed a number of pick's and the textured ones seem to work for me"}
{"source": "  I have dexdarity problems, Regular pick's without grips come out of my hands cause I am unable to control them,  So I needed something with a little more weight to it  allthough my fingures want to move around a little bit  I love these picks  now I can move my thumb and index fingers back to the bottom of the pick,  and it feels comfortable,  I used to do that with other (non textured)  pick's, And I kept droping them"}
{"source": "These pick's are a must have,  allso, sinse theire heavier then other pick's,  these and the Ice pick's really build up Your hand's And finger's"}
{"source": "I love these  pick's,  Im  defintley getting some more"}
{"source": "I take a medication that makes my hands shake; therefore, I have a difficult time with fine muscle movements"}

{"source": " They are also bigger than the Jazz III's, making it a bit easier to hold on to"}
{"source": "These picks are kind of thin, flexible, and have a good rubber grip"}
{"source": "  They're as good for speed-picking as they are for strumming"}
{"source": "  The only complaint I have is that they're too thin for me"}
{"source": "  The pack brings 6 picks"}
{"source": "  If you're looking for thin, flexible picks with a good grip, then these will do"}
{"source": "Dava 6024 Grip TipItem is as advertised"}

{"source": "My experience with this little tuner has been perfect"}
{"source": "It's extremely easy to see in a dark stage environment / it's dead quiet when activated / easy to understand when you are looking down at it while you're tuning / Takes up very little room on a pedal board / the cream on the coffee is that it's under a hundred bucks - that's crazy for the build quality - it's a little iron BRICKI highly recommend this little guy - Korg got it right on this one"}
{"source": "!!!"}
{"source": "This is pretty much the ideal tuner, as far as I'm concerned"}
{"source": "  It's true-bypass, brilliantly visible and easy to read on a dark stage, accurate, small footprint, durable, powers all your other pedals, and is under $100, especially if bought used"}
{"source": "its virtues are many and varied"}
{"source": "  If you've been using a cheap crappy tuner like I was, you'll notice the difference all the more"}
{"source": "If you want a hyper-accurate tuner for some kind of technical work, the Pitchblack's tolerances might not be quite what you're looking for"}
{"source": "  But as far as stage tuners go, it's got a tighter tolerance than the Boss stompbox"}
{"source": "If you want a buffer in your chain, this pedal won't supply it, as it is true-bypass"}
{"source": "If you want to hear your strings ringing out while you tune, this is not the pedal for you"}
{"source": "  The output is muted while the tuner is engaged"}
{"source": "  I prefer not to make my audience listen to me tune, so for me this is a non-issue"}
{"source": "  Plus, I like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch"}
{"source": "These are the only circumstances I can think of where there might be a valid reason not to buy a Pitchblack right this instant"}
{"source": "EDIT: After some time with this pedal, I've noticed that when used to power other pedals, some of them don't like being daisy-chained from this pedal's power output, most notably tremolos"}
{"source": "  But when the daisy-chain cable is connected straight to the power supply and the Pitchblack is powered like any other pedal, the problem vanishes"}
{"source": "  Kind of strange, and I figured worth noting here, but I don't consider it enough of a problem to take any points off or recommend this box any less"}
{"source": "There are some things in this life that you don't want to have to think about, and your tuner is one of them"}
{"source": "  You have enough to think about on stage without worrying about your tuner"}
{"source": "  It is fast, reliable and looks great on the pedal board"}
{"source": "  It is true bypass and doesn't add a bit of noise nor suck any tone at all"}
{"source": "  Your brand preference will guide your decision, but don't shy away from this well-made piece of equipment"}

{"source": "  When I did that, I heard something break inside the pedal, and when I went to use it again, it didn't work"}

{"source": "  Even though the pedal has cheap housing (which worries me a little bit), the Boss equivalent of this pedal is 3 times as much"}
{"source": "  So since this isn't a \"staple\" effect in my pedal board, I'm happy to go with something cheaper for now"}

{"source": "Addendum:  I've now owned this for a while, and discovered that it can turn my six-string Strat into a bass, by turning the balance knob all the way to the right, and my pitch on the second from bottom position"}
{"source": "  In fact, when I record my Dean Edge bass onto the Boss Loop Station and then record my Strat on top of it using the Behringer  Ultra Shifter/Harmonist, I cannot tell any difference in tonality"}
{"source": "I am thinking of selling my bass"}
{"source": "  It has just become a needless expense"}
{"source": "  Needs the neck adjusted twice a year, the strings are expensive, and it is harder to play then my Strat"}
{"source": "The Behringer US600 is well-made"}
{"source": " The high impact plastic housing should hold up well as long as it is not abused"}
{"source": " It is sufficiently quiet in all modes and it does not seem to color the sound in the bypass mode"}
{"source": "I purchased the US600 specifically for the &#34;Detune&#34; effect"}
{"source": " This effect works quite well with single coil pickups going through tube amps"}
{"source": " The effect is particularly dramatic when Outputs A & B are fed into two different amps, giving a nice room-filling stereo effect"}
{"source": "I was pleasantly surprised by some of the other effects"}
{"source": " The Pitch Shifter produces a very nice lower octave effect, about as good as I have heard anywhere"}
{"source": " When using both outputs, it is possible to feed the original signal into a guitar amp and the lower octave signal into a bass amp"}
{"source": " This makes the guitar sound HUGE!The Harmonist effect is amusing, but it has limited uses"}
{"source": " It won't make you sound like Duane Allman and Dickey Betts playing in harmony"}
{"source": " However, it is handy for short solos"}
{"source": " I tried it in the key of G and got useful results"}
{"source": "The Trem Bar would work well in loud uses like metal"}
{"source": " The Flutter effect gives a nice Leslie effect sound"}
{"source": "Overall I think this device offers more value than many more expensive pedals"}
{"source": " I have seen several speak ill of it, but I'm not sure they took sufficient time to learn how to use the pedal"}
{"source": " There is quite a learning curve on this gadget, but fulling results are obtainable if one takes time to master the device"}
{"source": "One other observation: This is more of a studio effect than a road effect"}
{"source": " There are many individual adjustments that need to be made in order to calibrate each effect"}
{"source": " It would be difficult to do this with the box on the floor"}
{"source": " I had to place it on top of my rig in order to access the control knobs and make adjustments"}
{"source": " The only way it would work well as a floor pedal would be it the device were dedicated to only one effect (Detune, for example) while gigging"}
{"source": "In conclusion, I debated for months whether or not to purchase this effect"}
{"source": " I'm glad I finally decided to get it"}
{"source": " The great sounding Detune effect alone makes it worth the price"}
{"source": " The Octave effect from the Pitch Shifter is a nice bonus"}
{"source": " The other effects are icing on the cake"}
{"source": " Kudos to Behringer for building another reasonably priced effect for the home studio enthusiast and the weekend warrior!"}
{"source": "Well, just got one of this and been messin with it for a couple of hours"}
{"source": "It's exactly what you would expect from Behringer, it works"}
{"source": "it's not great but it get's the job done, i feel it takes quite a bit of brightness and definition but it's still pretty useful for less than $25I don't regret geting this because delays are so much fun but i wonder if i should have gone withDanelectro D-8 Fab 600Ms Delaywell, maybe next time"}
{"source": "I give it a 3 out of 5, it wasn't this time Behringer surprised me"}
{"source": "This delay pedal was so cheap that I could not pass it up"}
{"source": "  and let me tell you, it is easy and fun to use!  I stopped messign with the reverb in my amp and now only use this for a much nice sounds from my guitar"}
{"source": "  I actually bought it to try some experiments with my harmonica, but those were dismal failures"}
{"source": "  Big win for the guitar though!"}
{"source": "If you want to have an interesting echo and repeat, this is worth the minimal investment"}
{"source": "  I recommend buying the multi-plug power supply as it goes through batteries fairly quickly and you will likely be buying other pedals to compliment this one"}
{"source": "An old school delay that works very well"}
{"source": " Simple to use"}
{"source": " Adjustments for intensity and length"}
{"source": " Uses 9V batt or power adaptor"}
{"source": " Reasonably priced"}
{"source": "I replaced my delay foot pedal with the Behringer VD400 Analog Delay"}
{"source": " For the money it is a more than a competent addition to my pedal board "}
{"source": " It is doing exactly what I expected and much more"}
{"source": " The big name delay I replaced , in all honesty , wasn't as good"}
{"source": " I have more room and control with this pedal"}
{"source": " Also I can buy six of these pedals for what I paid for the last one "}
{"source": " You do the math!!!!"}
{"source": "This is an excellent choice if you're looking for a nice analog delay with a small footprint"}
{"source": "It looks great, it's easy to use, and it's a fantastic size for a delay pedal"}
{"source": "The analog delay is nice and warm -- much more satisfying than digital delay to my ears"}
{"source": " Also, the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays"}
{"source": "There is a internal adjustment that I don't think I will need to use for now anyway"}
{"source": "I highly recommend it !"}
{"source": "This is hands down the best delay pedal I have ever used"}
{"source": " I owned a Boss DD-3 for many years and I have tried various other brands, but this little beauty takes the cake"}
{"source": " The delay is pure analog so it produces a smooth and creamy sound"}
{"source": " It is very easy on the ears in both clean and distorted settings, and it adds exponentially to your tone"}
{"source": " When turned off it is true bypass, which means it does not color your guitar's natural tone in any way"}
{"source": " I recognized a notable difference when I unhooked my DD-3 and plugged in the Carbon Copy"}
{"source": "The pedal is slightly smaller than most pedals but it is built like a tank"}
{"source": " The price point is a little expensive but, in this instance, you get what you pay for"}
{"source": " If you're looking for a creamy, true bypass, analog pedal then look no further"}
{"source": " The Carbon Copy is the best there is!"}
{"source": "I have a LOT of pedals"}
{"source": " including many delays and echos"}
{"source": "The MXR is just little more organic and warm in tone and response then my Aqua Puss, EH Delux Memory Boy, Ibanez, Boss, and lets not even get into the Behringer stuff"}
{"source": "  :)I like the chorus-like mod button"}
{"source": "  Very lush and sweet to listen too"}
{"source": "  Not as feature rich as some of my other delays, but a tad more appealing to the ear then the others to me"}
{"source": "  Simple to use, compact and well built"}
{"source": "  I like using this clean"}
{"source": " but even it's ability to take some distortion is pretty good"}
{"source": "This is simliar to my favorite echo (the Morely ECV from the 70's) in that is has that real warm surrounding sound to it"}
{"source": "  Lush is the right word"}
{"source": "Hope this helps"}
{"source": "The reverb broke in my amp and I tried the Boss FRV-1 to replace it and didn't really like it too much"}
{"source": "  Then I read that a darker analog delay can sort of sound reverby"}
{"source": "  This is exactly what I wanted"}
{"source": "  It fills out the sound and yet doesn't add any artificial high end"}
{"source": "  Sounds gorgeous for what I do, which is playing alone in a basement"}
{"source": "  For most songs it's always on, and it really excels at vintagy-sounding stuff like Rockabilly and Surf"}
{"source": "  The mod button is a nice add-on but I haven't really bonded with it yet"}
{"source": "If I had to buy this over again I might consider the Aqua Puss because I don't use the high delay times all that much and the Aqua Puss has an easy access battery door"}
{"source": "While I've never been a big delay guy, I've always felt my pedal board was missing this particular effect"}
{"source": "  I'm definitely not a fan of digital delay, so I did a lot of R&D; on analog delays in hopes to find the right one for me"}
{"source": "There are basically three options out there for delays under $200: MXR Carbon Copy, EHX Memory Boy, and Malekko Ekko 616"}
{"source": "  I realize that there are other pedals out there, but according to my research these are the best three for the price"}
{"source": "The Memory Boy seemed good but my concern was it can do a lot of exaggerated modulation, something I was not interesting in"}
{"source": "  Crazy effects are an EHX trademark so if you're looking for that sort of thing the Memory Boy might be up your alley"}
{"source": "  I read nothing but good things about the Malekko Ekko and tossed back and forth between that and the Carbon Copy for a while and ultimately went with the Carbon Copy because I was able to find the most first-hand reviews of it"}
{"source": "I don't regret my decision, this pedal sounds great"}
{"source": "  The repeats are long and do not sound artificial"}
{"source": "  Some people complain the repeats are too dark but I don't think those people understand the difference between analog and digital delay"}
{"source": "  If you're looking to recreate The Edge sound, analog delay is not for you"}
{"source": "I'm able to create all types of sounds from this pedal from just thickening up a rhythm track, to slapstick, to dreamy repeats on solos"}
{"source": "  I love it"}
{"source": "  Sometimes I just leave the pedal on with the mix knob dialed down for subtle ambience in my tone"}
{"source": "One minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile, at least out-of-the-box"}
{"source": "  There are internal trimpots to make the effect more pronounced but I have yet to mess with them"}
{"source": "  I would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself"}
{"source": "Love this pedal"}
{"source": " The Mod button just makes it sound like tremolo to me and I have great classic Fender tremolo on the amp I use so I don't use that option much"}
{"source": " I just use it for when I want a little slap-back and it works great for that and provides a real nice analog tone"}
{"source": "This is a great effect"}
{"source": " I am very happy with it"}
{"source": " Awesome engineering as Jim Dunlop's MXR products has always presented"}
{"source": " The true bypass feature and the high-end quality materials make it very reliable and dependable"}
{"source": " This delay device is (on my humble opinion) probably the best delay out there"}
{"source": " It is very sensitive and delivers as it should, with a delay rate from 0 to 600 miliseconds"}
{"source": " Most units offer a max of around the 400 mark and are normally quite large in size and take a lot of space on the pedal boards"}
{"source": " This pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver"}
{"source": " I am actually sure this will exceed all your expectations"}
{"source": " Ships fast"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": "One of the great surprises in the last couple of years has been the MXR Carbon Copy delay pedal"}
{"source": " Designed by Way Huge founder Jeorge Tripps, is a great analog delay for under $175"}
{"source": "00"}
{"source": " Using bucket brigade circuitry, true bypass and a very simple 3 knob interface, the Carbon Copy is a very flexible unit"}
{"source": " Utilizing the \"modulation\" switch, you can achieve a slight chorusing sound (like the flutter from old tape echoes) which can be adjusted via the internal trim pot"}
{"source": "The unit has a small footprint (like most MXR pedals) so it is very pedal board friendly"}
{"source": "This is truly a great sounding delay so try one out"}
{"source": "What can I say? First it's MXR"}
{"source": "enough said"}
{"source": " This company (Dunlop) gets it right with the MXR line"}
{"source": " I was a Boss guy but was never really happy with the delay or chorus from them"}
{"source": " I don't hate Boss and use their Super-Overdrive in my chain"}
{"source": " I already own a MXR Dyna Comp & Phaser 90 pedal so I took the leap and bought this delay"}
{"source": " Wow! It's so much warmer than the Boss"}
{"source": " Side by side the MXR won hands down"}
{"source": "well at least for me"}
{"source": " It goes from slap-back to space shot very easily"}
{"source": " It's a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use"}
{"source": " I'm really happy with this and would replace it god forbid"}
{"source": "Warm analog delay very natural sound, not sterile at all very ez to use, no harsh digital BS, I like this way better than the BOSS"}
{"source": " Plus is is MXR and built like a tank to last a lifetime"}
{"source": "this pedal worked well, but I sent it back because thru my marshall itgenerated a lot more line noise than I like, other than that it was cool!!!!"}
{"source": "This unit produce a warm and vintage sound of a analog delay"}
{"source": " It's not so &#34;digital and bright&#34; delay like Boss DD3 or DD7"}
{"source": " Mod switch adds a perfect &#34;chorus&#34; effect for 80's Metal Ballads sound"}
{"source": "I had the Behringer DR 600 (Ultra Reverb), but was unhappy with its tone and limited selection of reverb sounds"}
{"source": " Although this unit is only $10 more, the difference in sound and tone may as well be $100 difference in quality of sound"}
{"source": " That is, this one really sounds super once you adjust it to your own preferences"}
{"source": " It may not have every reverb sound, but it has a nice selection, and they cover an impressive range, as well as giving you the option of &#34;wet&#34; (full) or &#34;dry&#34; (tinny) sounds and a &#34;trails&#34; that essentially adds some sustain"}
{"source": " There's also an &#34;echo&#34; setting, but it's not very pronounced, though it does add an &#34;echo-like&#34; sound"}
{"source": "So, my complaints are not with the quality of the machine or the range of effects or their qualities"}
{"source": "There are a couple of annoying inconveniences"}
{"source": " One is the BRIGHT blue light (indicating &#34;on&#34;)"}
{"source": " This has been commented on before"}
{"source": " I have an array of pedals and this one is as bright as all the others combined"}
{"source": " When it's on, you can't read the dials because of the glare in your eyes"}
{"source": " I did find a solution"}
{"source": " I put dark nail polish over the LED bulb"}
{"source": " I had to put it on and wait for it to dry and reapply several times to get the dimming I desired"}
{"source": "The second annoyance is that the name of the pedal is in black letters against a dark blue pedal color"}
{"source": " This is impossible to read in stage (or even dim room) lighting"}
{"source": " Of course, you can &#34;remember&#34; where it is or which one it is, but my other Behringer pedals all have white lettering, making them much easier to read"}
{"source": " Every B"}
{"source": " pedal has its own distinctive color, so that helps"}
{"source": " My solution to this little dilemma was to buy some 1/4&#34; white vinyl letters from Office Depot and put them over the words &#34;REVERB&#34; on the pedal"}
{"source": "It was annoying to have to make these cosmetic changes, but now I'm much happier with the pedal and can enjoy its sound instead of focusing on these minor irritations"}
{"source": "This inexpensive pedal kicks ass, provides everything from subtle spring reverb to VAST cathedral-like reverb"}
{"source": " The 'Space' setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note, providing a strange harmony"}
{"source": " Some people pick on Behreinger because they're stuff is (still) cheap"}
{"source": " I admit that two of their pedals (of the 10 that I have bought) underwhelmed me"}
{"source": " This one is a keeper!"}
{"source": "Works well, has many options of reverb and tweaks on all the options"}
{"source": "  I would recommend this pedal for an inexpensive reverb"}
{"source": "Some things are great values, others are cheap"}
{"source": " The Behringer is cheap"}
{"source": " The clips are cheap"}
{"source": " The clip that holds the 9V broke after the first change"}
{"source": " The clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic"}
{"source": " IF you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use"}
{"source": " It's also a noisy pedal"}
{"source": " Like noisier than my Dyna Comp and OD pedals combined"}
{"source": " Like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise"}
{"source": " If you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries"}
{"source": "All of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a Reverb pedal that has several usable features"}
{"source": " The 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good"}
{"source": " It also has a worth-the-price-alone \"space\" feature"}
{"source": " Also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument)"}
{"source": " Paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones"}
{"source": "The RV600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features"}
{"source": " If you gig or record and need a reverb"}
{"source": "well"}
{"source": "you aren't even looking at this pedal"}
{"source": " If you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option"}
{"source": "Up date from February 08 2011 Wow look at all of Them that did Not find My review helpful I should have up dated much sooner,Not that I care because I tell the truth and do good to please Myself Not a bunch of fools"}
{"source": " The first time I turned It on It was exactly the Sound I was looking for Shimmer and Space verb"}
{"source": "Okay I Am apologizing for ordering the last one I guess I take the easiest way of ordering but If It makes You feel better It put Me farther In financial problems but If You look on some search there are some still left"}
{"source": " Behringer needs to look at what The Customers Is buying and make more of them"}
{"source": " If Your buying this Reverb Machine then You must be wanting It for Its Ducking also called Shimmer and Space verb If Not then there are cheaper Reverbs as Danelectro as FAB Echo which Is a nice Sounding older type slap reverbs Sound and there Is the more expensive Line 6 Verbzilla, and Someone wrote Me and said Boss has or did have this effect there are Internet videos showing this effect"}
{"source": " My Digitech GSP 2101 quit working right It has Ducking Shimmer which Digitech calls String Swell which Is a Violin type Sound and They call Space verb Giga verb and I made the mistake of buying the Behringer Slow Motion 200 thinking String or Volume Swell was Shimmer then If found what I was looking for on Internet video I hope"}
{"source": " I had already Wrote some Songs using My Digitech GSP 2101 and started having dreams about having this Sound effect again and just had to have It"}
{"source": "How well this Behringer RV600 performs and Sounds I have Not received It yet to know but If possible I will do an up date but I have a Behringer EP2500 Power Amplifier that still works good which I even used as part of a Rife, Doug coil machine but the EP4000 would be better for that use Also the fan runs all the time"}
{"source": "Bought Verbzilla, Digitech RV-7, and the verbzilla's ripoff : Behringer RV600"}
{"source": "The types of reverb i get from Verbzilla is very insignificant to be used for my synths "}
{"source": " so for that many kind of modes, barely useful"}
{"source": " And I HATE the fact that line 6 always used the MIX knob instead of the separated level and reverb/fx level, cos you have to sacrifice your volume to get an extreme reverb, which is sucks"}
{"source": "Then i tried the digitech rv-7"}
{"source": " First thought was "}
{"source": " Wow, what a construction it's got there"}
{"source": " Fancy knobs, and additional stuffs like thick rubberized knobs cover, velcro, glow in the dark sticker"}
{"source": " And the fact that it has the lexicon soul in it"}
{"source": " I love this one better than the verbzilla, cos you don't have to sacrifice the volume to get a heavy reverb"}
{"source": " but the problem was "}
{"source": " there's no heavy reverb there"}
{"source": " I couldn't get a ridiculous amount of reverb out of this pedal"}
{"source": " But I love the gated reverb feature among all modes"}
{"source": " Every other modes are just nothing special really"}
{"source": " It was just a light reverb i get"}
{"source": "Aaaand finally i tried this blue thick plastic pedal "}
{"source": " skeptical at first, and i can see that it has also the mix knob like verbzilla has I was a little disappointed"}
{"source": " But I really can sense my juno 60 and my moog sings differently on each modes with this one"}
{"source": " And I'm very happy that the mix and the decay could go ridiculous without having volume loss as much as the verbzilla does"}
{"source": " It could be painful for guitar players, cos they cannot boost up your guitar volume without anything else if it's already full, but I could always gain the volume of my synth to balance it with the mix knob (since i never put the volume knob on the synth at full)"}
{"source": " I could sense the difference of each modes with this pedal and it's hell loads of them"}
{"source": "Let me tell you the ugly truth about those 3 pedals that i've tried"}
{"source": " they are ALL battery hogs! It was ridiculous "}
{"source": " i mean bad bad ridiculous that it was only lasted about 5-10 mins of nonstop use of battery before it's dried up"}
{"source": " So I suggest you to use the power adapter"}
{"source": " And the only thing i hate about RV600 is the way that we have to put back the battery cover to it's place cos we have to put the spring back to it's track while closing it slowly, and that black plastic latch on the side doesn't feel it could last longI don't care what ppl said about this pedal, but it's been very useful for me and my synthesizers, we don't need to get an expensive gears as long as we can make great sounds"}
{"source": " It's all comes back to our ability to make good music"}
{"source": " Good luck guys!"}
{"source": "I've been using and abusing pedal effects since the 1970's"}
{"source": "  ["}
{"source": "] , running all sorts of things through them, chaining them in all sorts of configurations, and have endured many 'wall wart' pedal meltdowns over the years"}
{"source": " I said all that b/c I don't want to come off as condescending"}
{"source": " I've learned that the single most effective way to power pedals properly is to have an infinite number of 9v batteries, or to be very careful to match pedal inputs with correct adaptor outputs"}
{"source": " Check the polarity of the tip - is the tip positive or negative? You'll fry a Boss pedal in a flash if you plug a hot positive tip into one"}
{"source": " Make sure the polarity matches (most pedals want negative tip adaptors, except Digitech which want 1/8\" plugs)"}
{"source": " Make sure the voltage matches"}
{"source": " A 3v adaptor into a 9v pedal won't power it"}
{"source": " Checking that these things are right will save you some $, and some of the Behringer pedals (I use about six of them on my board"}
{"source": "see product links) are \"polarity fragile\", and will break right away with the wrong adaptor"}

{"source": "Pros:I bought this pedal primarily in place of a volume pedal, or swell pedal, because it does that function fairly well, and a lot cheaper"}
{"source": " Aside from that, it also does nearly every other type of delay needed:*the tape/digital/analog switch slightly changes the sound of each delay*the trails feature can be useful for holding a sound (in swell mode with high repeats) when the pedal is &#34;off&#34; and then playing over it with notes or harmony*the time knob acts like an analog knob, pitch shifting when turned after playing a note*the repeats knob can go from a little more than one repeat to self oscillation (sometimes runaway) depending on the delay type*the mix knob can nearly cut out the dry signal*stereo input allows for multiple instruments to play into itWhile the pedal has small problems, it compensates by inexpensive fixesCons:The modulation is a kind of adjustable width/depth all in one knob, and isn't the best compared to a chorus pedal"}
{"source": " Just a general warbleThe blue led is VERY bright, to the point where you can't see the settings on the knobs, so I cover it with a sticker (it still shows through enough haha)*The casing is plastic, but it is thick and durable enough (maybe not for consistent gigging)*being a digital effect, the footswitch is not state dependent, in other words, if you turn off the pedal, unplug it, and plug it back in, the pedal will turn on*because it is buffered bypass, the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it, even when off*the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch, and then lift up*there is no noticeable &#34;click&#34; when you change delay type; however, the led flashesOther notes:almost half the weight of the pedal is the bottom metal plate"}
{"source": " The pedal without it feels shockingly lightweight, but with it has a good amount of heft"}
{"source": "For those that don't know, this pedal is a copy of the more expensive Line 6 Echo Park"}
{"source": " The two things that make it better than the real deal are the lower price and the (IMO) better tap tempo"}
{"source": " You have to do an odd sort of clicking sequence with the Echo Park, but with the Echo Machine you simply hold down the footswitch for 2 seconds, and then set your tap tempo"}
{"source": " When you're satisfied, just hold again to enter regular on/off mode"}
{"source": " Foolproof"}
{"source": "Some folks will point to superior construction with the Echo Park, and I won't totally deny that"}
{"source": " That said, the effects modules and the construction of the Behringer pedals are basically the same - plastic where you'd like metal, and surface mount construction (practical maintenance is really only possible by the manufacturer)"}
{"source": " But again, there is a switch in the tone dock that requires maintenance at some point - if it can't be cleaned up, the dock becomes a paperweight"}
{"source": "As best I can tell, all the other settings are the same between this copy and the original"}
{"source": " That makes sense, as it saves Behringer the costs of any R&D; - they just had to make it fit in the dimensions of their enclosures, and alter the tap tempo algorithm/access"}
{"source": " That's a win for the customer because it decreases the price"}
{"source": " For those who find a moral dilemma in buying a copy of something else, I'd submit that most of what is in your pedal collection has probably been either partly or wholly copied from something else"}
{"source": " Unless you want to restrict yourself to the known originals and the prices they fetch, this is oftentimes the standard option"}
{"source": " If there is a worthy improvement (IMO in a practical sense usually more than a sonic one), it would kind of behoove you to insist on the original"}
{"source": " The tap tempo on the EM600 earns its purchase, just like the lower noise floor of the Biyang Compress X earns it as a purchase over what it copies 1:1 - the venerable MXR Dyna Comp"}
{"source": "So why only 4 stars? Because it's a 2-way street - the cost cutting means that this pedal will potentially be something for the landfill in years to come"}
{"source": " There's no denying this, and to get 5 stars requires unsurpassed durability at any price point"}
{"source": " Despite what you may think, it can be done - the flipside is an ever so slightly higher cost"}
{"source": " Behringer probably decided they preferred the increased profit per unit instead, or didn't want to go above a certain price point and risk getting beat by direct competitors"}
{"source": "The other BIG reason to knock a star off is that with a little amp that you have to crank to get acceptable volumes from, there is quite a bit of audible hiss from this pedal"}
{"source": " If all I used were my bigger amps, I would have never noticed, and it wouldn't have been an issue at all"}
{"source": " But the 21st century is a time of lower playing volumes in live settings, which means the smaller amps are more popular"}
{"source": " So the hiss could absolutely be a deal breaker"}
{"source": " It might be slightly lower than the P"}
{"source": "A"}
{"source": " you're using, but I wouldn't be so sure"}
{"source": " I'd say you'd want a (true) 30 watt amp to ensure this isn't an issue, but that may be absolute overkill for the gigs you play"}
{"source": "But my aggravations are really small ones"}
{"source": " Overall, this pedal works fine through any amp I've tried it with, as some are kind of picky especially with delay pedals"}
{"source": " I've typically found digital delay to work better with drive/OD/distortion pedals as opposed to analog delay, and this pedal is no different - as much as I like my MXR Carbon Copy and BBE Two Timer, they aren't nearly as flexible"}
{"source": " This one IMO is on par with the flexibility of the old Boss DD-2/DD-3 or Danelectro Dan Echo"}
{"source": " But it surpasses them with all of the different types of delay effects"}
{"source": " Many of those are something I would never use, but I could imagine how others would absolutely love them"}
{"source": " Or - they could come in handy for something specific, or be great flexibility in the recording studio"}
{"source": "Also worth considering is that at the EM600's price, you could buy a backup or a 2nd one for different settings"}
{"source": "This pedal is amazing"}
{"source": " It has so many functions"}
{"source": " Unless your a caveman there is no need to worry about it being plastic"}
{"source": " I love this pedal and I would completely recommend it"}
{"source": "This is my second Makala gig bag"}

{"source": "S"}

{"source": " Single layer of fabric providing no protection"}
{"source": " After comparing that bag to the one for my Makala uke, I came straight to this page and ordered another Makala bag"}
{"source": "Why do I like this bag better? Its multiple layers provide some padding and protection for the uke inside"}

{"source": "  As good as a hard case?  Of course not"}
{"source": " But very good for a bag"}
{"source": "I also like the fact that there's no logo on the outside"}
{"source": " I can buy a decent bag and put whatever uke I want inside"}
{"source": " That was a disappointment for another reviewer, for me it's a plus"}
{"source": "What don't I like?  The dorky pad around the handle"}
{"source": "  Both my concert & tenor bags had the handle pad and the first project for both was to remove it"}
{"source": "  It's not as if the uke inside weighs so much you need a special pad for the handle!  And it just looks better without it"}

{"source": " Anyway it doesn't seem much more then a normal gig bag"}
{"source": " Yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not"}
{"source": " Not sure how well it holds a tenor since I don't have one"}
{"source": " Mine is black not the almost purple the image shows"}
{"source": "It cannot be denied that the BOSS DD-7 is a versatile effective product"}
{"source": "And it does EXACTLY what it claims to do, and does it well - but - I have a mixed relationship with this pedal"}
{"source": "On one hand it does so many things with REVERSE / MODULATE / ANALOG settings as well as a half dozen other delay related settings it's a versatile tool - in fact it does everything you could ask a delay pedal to do except one thing"}
{"source": " (one thing)In a live setting you have to set it and forget it (period)The four tiny fragile control knobs and the tiny black printed control panel are UN-USABLE (cannot be used) in a live dark stage environment"}
{"source": "so when I'm at home putzing around on my guitar the BOSS DD-7 sits on my pedal board and gets used, but when I have a gig, it get's pulled from the board and the MXR Carbon Copy gets plugged into the slot and gets the nod in the performance category"}
{"source": " The MXR Carbon Copy can be controlled by your foot and can be read from a standing position under any lighting conditions"}
{"source": " so it gets used up there when the pressure is onThe BOSS DD-7 is a great pedal in a well lit practice environment ONLY - if you go live with it - good luck"}
{"source": "HOLD feature allows you to \"record\" individual \"tracks\" and overlap them on one another on the go--live!  Dont get too ambitious though as the more \"tracks\" you add the more distorted the sound becomes"}
{"source": "  I haven't used expensive rack units etc"}
{"source": ", but this is great fun and versatility allows many different uses"}
{"source": "  Excellent value"}
{"source": "  Battery runs out fast so get an AC adaptor!"}
{"source": "I literally just took this pedal out of the box an hour and a half ago and it has already blown me away"}
{"source": " I've only begun to scratch the surface of what this pedal can do, and i've made funky/weird loops of sound, bizarre cricket noises, long delays that instead of fading out actually get LOUDER with time"}
{"source": " I dont know how else to say it, If you are looking for a delay pedal, you just found it"}
{"source": " This thing can do anything"}
{"source": "It feels like the iPhone of delay pedals to me so far"}
{"source": " like it can do all this crazy cool stuff"}
{"source": " but oh yeah, it can also just do an echo too"}
{"source": " (Wait, you can call people with an iPhone?)I could have waited a week or so to really learn everything this pedal can do and write a detailed review of it's performance, but i dont feel i have to"}
{"source": " It's the latest BOSS delay pedal"}
{"source": " what else is there to say?Also with the price range of 130-160 dollars its a huge bargin compared to other BOSS pedals that might pull off a similar effect such as the RC-2($180-200), or RC-20XL($240-300)"}
{"source": " Granted i know very little about the FULL capabilities of those pedals, but the DD-7 has up to 40 seconds worth of loop play in \"Hold\" mode"}
{"source": " And the hold mode is so much more sophisticated that what I am familiar with"}
{"source": " since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the DD-3"}
{"source": "Sorry if I'm rambling, but seriously I'm in love with this pedal"}
{"source": " Perhaps i will post a video demo of some of the weird junk you can do with it at some point"}
{"source": "This pedal is awesome"}
{"source": " Not only does the DD-7 offer standard dealy and echo it also has reverse delay, modulation, and loop functions"}
{"source": " It's capable of looping up to 40 seconds of play which is a wonderful tool for writing two and three part harmonies or working out timing"}
{"source": " This pedal is amazing and I highly recomend it for any guitar player"}
{"source": " Most of my pedals are Boss because they only build their equipment to industrial strength and standards"}
{"source": " This means their stuff is made to last"}
{"source": " No flimsy plastics, cheap rubber, or faulty components or parts will cut it in Boss's supieror product line"}
{"source": "These cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the USA"}
{"source": "  I had one just like this with the Neutrik connectors (gave away as gift) and now have two with the G&H; Show Saver connector option"}
{"source": "  This makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the price"}
{"source": "These cables are well-balanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass"}
{"source": "  They are well-shielded, look nice, and handle well"}
{"source": "You could pay more for gold plating for slightly better corrosion resistance or for woven coverings to make the wire look cute, if you want to"}
{"source": "I bought these to replace the cruddy cables that came with an all-in-one guitar/amplifier/etc"}
{"source": " kit that finally went bad"}
{"source": "Seriously, for the price, these can't be beat"}
{"source": " I'd even pay a lot more for them"}
{"source": " Don't let the off-brand name put you off"}
{"source": " Go ahead and get them - you'll be glad you did"}
{"source": "I'm using mine on a Strat straight into the amp, and also through effects pedals, and through both paths they work great: no added hiss or other noise, no pops or cracks, nothing"}
{"source": " Perfectly quiet cables that deliver the signal from the guitar at full strength without modification"}
{"source": "Get 'em"}
{"source": "I have a home studio and needed extra cables for my three guitars and keyboard"}
{"source": " I wanted to have them all plugged in and ready to go without having to switch cables all the time"}
{"source": " So, I tried this cable and it works perfectly"}
{"source": " Very heavy cord and top quality construction"}
{"source": " Can't beat the price either"}
{"source": " Will buy again"}
{"source": "Unhappy with it, actually I already replaced them"}
{"source": " The method of attachment is poorly designed, it doesn't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls, the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions"}
{"source": " Expensive locks too"}
{"source": "These are nice strap locks, but the screw is hand tightened and strap movement seems to make it come loose"}
{"source": " This can probably be solved by the use of a lock nut"}
{"source": " Otherwise these are a good value with easy on & off"}
{"source": "I had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so I experimented and replaced all the tubes"}
{"source": "  Issues not only continued but worsened"}
{"source": "  Hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes"}
{"source": "  I eventually put back the original El84s and that didn't help"}
{"source": "  Once I removed the Tung-Sol 12AX7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par"}
{"source": "  My experience with the Tung-Sol tubes was very, very negative"}
{"source": "  They caused me to go out and buy another amp"}
{"source": "  I had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast"}
{"source": "  I'll never buy this brand again"}
{"source": "PEOPLE!  YOU NEED TO BE STATING WHICH AMP AND SPEAKERS YOU USE OR YOUR REVIEW IS POINTLESS!That being said, the reason is because every amp will cause the tube to react and sound differently"}
{"source": "  Speakers will also create a very different sound with each tube choice"}
{"source": " Type of pickups in your guitar will also cause a different outcome"}
{"source": "Amp:  Vox ac30hw2Speakers: Celestion Alnico Blue 8 ohmPower Tubes: JJ EL84Pre Amp Tube: Tungsol 12ax7 in V1 and the stock Ruby tubes in the other 2 spotsHow I Set My Amp: Volume just before breakup and 12o'clock with bass and treble knobs (changes per guitar but stays close)Guitars Used: Fender Telecaster Deluxe 'Chris Shiflett' with stock pups, Gretsch Silver Falcon 2010 with stock Filtertrons, Gretsch Sparkle Jet Blue Pearl with stock Filtertrons, Fender Jazzmaster 65' American Reissue with stock p90's"}
{"source": "I also purchased a JJ12ax7 to see how that sounded so will compare the ruby, JJ and this Tongsol preamp tubes"}
{"source": "I found the Tongsol to give me the best tone over all"}
{"source": "  Less bright but still keeping all the chime in this amp"}
{"source": " It caused just enough high end roll off to give the warmth I've been looking for (to my ears)"}
{"source": " I found the JJ12ax7 to be much clearer but slightly harsher in the high end-maybe more Fenderish? I REALLY like the way the Tungsol makes my Jazzmaster sound"}
{"source": "  It's heaven!  It gives me the perfect breakup point and perfect roll off of highs"}
{"source": "My findings could and probably will be different from yours because of your guitar, cable quality, pick attack and style of playing"}
{"source": " My best advise is BUY MANY different brands and TRY THEM ALL in your amp"}
{"source": " they're not that expensive if you go with the cheaper ones"}
{"source": "  Most likely you will buy a different amp at some point so keep the tubes to maybe use in that one"}
{"source": "Not sure how to rate this tube? Replaced a Chinese preamp tube in my Champion 600 and couldnt tell any difference in tone"}
{"source": " Maybe it is built better? But thats yet to be seen"}
{"source": " I did put a EH6V6 in with the Chinese preamp tube and did notice an improvement but the EH6V6 only lasted five minutes and shorted out"}
{"source": " So i sent it back"}
{"source": " I ordered a TS 6V6 and am still waiting for it"}
{"source": " Maybe NOS is the way to go with the preamp tubes? Time will tell"}
{"source": "Well made tube with good amount of gain and highs"}
{"source": " Excellent for cleans and crunch due to increased clarity"}
{"source": " For high gain metal, however, I found that it's a bit too hairy"}
{"source": " For instance, as V1 position in my preamp, it had a little too much trebly sizzle versus other tubes"}
{"source": " For comparison, a Sovtek has less of this \"hair\" and is tighter sounding but also has more of an upper mid-range fizz which can get annoying"}
{"source": " In the end, I switched the Tung Sol with a Ruby AC7 which was formerly in the V2 (overdrive) position, and that got me better articulation with less fizz"}
{"source": " So Ruby AC7 in V1, Tung Sol in V2 - that's been my best combo so far"}
{"source": "There's nothing wrong with this stand, but for the life of me I cannot imagine how a manufacturer could manage to screw up an plain old straight mic stand"}
{"source": "Oh Man, My Guitars have a new home, love this stand, looks nice and works excellent, currently I have a Strat Style guitar a bass and a Epi Les Paul hanging on this baby, but even with just one guitar it holds up just fine, No unsteadiness, no wiggling, Big space saver, definitely a Good Pick, Great for home use or on the road, it folds up nicely, great padding on heads and body supports, 10 out of 10 on this one"}
{"source": "Don't buy this Chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand"}
{"source": " It is barely workable for two"}
{"source": "It is easy to set up, but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place"}
{"source": " And you absolutely  have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground"}
{"source": "The best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back"}
{"source": " For Les Paul and Strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new"}
{"source": " You can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible"}
{"source": " So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand"}
{"source": " If you just gotta buy something from On Stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced"}
{"source": " But really, you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang"}
{"source": "This is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for"}
{"source": "I use this stand for a smaller 50 watt Fender amp"}
{"source": "  I don't think I would recommend it for larger amplifiers, especially since it sits a little high, but for my amp, it's perfect"}
{"source": "  Nevertheless, I also don't really plan on packing it up or moving the stand around much, so I can't imagine it being ideal for portability"}
{"source": "  If you have a music studio and are doing more recording and/or rehearsing than playing gigs, this is a really nice stand"}
{"source": "This stand easily supports my 50 poundFender Frontman 212R 100-Watt 2x12-Inch Guitar Combo Ampat any height setting"}
{"source": " In fact, even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier"}
{"source": "I love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand"}
{"source": " It is essentially three parts: the base and two removable arms"}
{"source": " Granted that this is heavy, but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank"}
{"source": "In addition to being rock solid, the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances"}
{"source": " The support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement, and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions"}
{"source": " You merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position"}
{"source": " Once you line up the holes, release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place"}
{"source": "My only complaint - and it is more of a wish - is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle"}
{"source": " I would love it if I could adjust that too, but I am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand"}
{"source": " One final note: these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage"}
{"source": " Specifically, it increases the depth dimension by nearly 100% of my Frontman 212R, although the difference in length is nominal"}
{"source": " I mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages"}
{"source": "Overall, this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy-duty"}
{"source": " At the current price (at the time of this review) it's a bargain"}
{"source": "I gig a lot and since I am a grey haired musician I need to sit when it will be over an hour of playing"}
{"source": " This seat works great for me and folds up and can be disassembled with very little fuss"}
{"source": " The back rest support is nice, too"}
{"source": " For the price its well constructed and perfect for the solo musician doing gigs all over the country"}
{"source": "I use the chair for guitar, bass, keyboards,ukulele and even cooking breakfast"}
{"source": " Lightweight, slightly awkward, but provides good back support"}
{"source": "As a right-handed player I practice, both classical and jazz style, with the guitar on my left knee"}
{"source": " For the position I use in this chair it is necessary to use the On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest"}
{"source": " I do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck"}
{"source": " I can report that I have been very comfortable for long practice sessions"}
{"source": "As for the four out of five star review, the price does seem steep when you look at what you get for $85"}
{"source": " But it's a nice design and thank you to the designer"}
{"source": " I would recommend it to those who can afford it"}
{"source": "As for durability"}
{"source": " we shall see"}
{"source": " I have had it for three months now and it is still fine"}
{"source": "  I use it daily"}
{"source": "Firstly let me address the &#34;adjustable backrest&#34;"}
{"source": " There's nothing adjustable about the backrest"}
{"source": " The seat moves forward and backward about two inches which actually is a considerable difference in how it feels leaning back against the backrest but the backrest itself doesn't move, the seat does"}
{"source": " It also does not adjust up and down as you would think an &#34;adjustable&#34; backrest should"}
{"source": " The backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this"}
{"source": " But the seat does adjust slightly forward and back (presumably this is the purported backrest adjustment the description repeatedly asserts) and it does adjust up and down over quite a range so adjusting for height should not be a problem"}
{"source": " The footrest, however, is welded in place so if you plan to use the footrest you're again limited to where you can put the seat in height range"}
{"source": "All this aside I am still giving the stool high marks because it's a fair price, it does fold down with some extra dis-assembly for transport to venues and I find it works well for me"}
{"source": " But for how it works for me you should know: I wanted this initially to play sitting down without a strap"}
{"source": " I found that no matter how I adjusted the stool that I was just not comfortable with how the guitar rested and so I use it now exclusively with a strap"}
{"source": " In this way however it's actually really nice because I can use the footrest or not at will and I can also stand up, walk around and then sit back down at will"}
{"source": " Without the strap, though, my playing dexterity is compromised by slight balancing required to keep the guitar from smashing to the floor (at least in my mind's eye)"}
{"source": "If you want a stool that folds up and goes with you this is not that stool"}
{"source": " You do need to loosen the screws and take the seat post out and remove the backrest"}
{"source": " Then you're left with several pieces to schlep"}
{"source": " Not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day"}
{"source": "Overall though I am very happy with the way this stool feels"}
{"source": " No more couch and kitchen chairs for me"}
{"source": "I feared that this stand was not big enough for my guitarr&oacute;n which is at least as big as, but much thicker than, a cello"}
{"source": " But its design appeared amenable to some home-modification that might make it work, so at the price I took a chance and bought it"}
{"source": " Well, the back of my guitarr&oacute;n bulges out like a blowfish, so the neck could not lay back into the upper fork, but it turned out that when this stand is fully extended, my guitarr&oacute;n's body is very gently clamped between the upper and lower forks, like they were made for that"}
{"source": " No modifications needed, not even bending"}
{"source": "Some reviewers have said that the slightest bump will knock this stand over, but I suspect that none of those reviewers had all three legs COMPLETELY open and therefore extended to its widest base"}
{"source": " If you don't really LOOK closely as you open the legs, you'll think you've reached the stop before the legs are fully open"}
{"source": " I didn't have it fully open at first, and it was a just a bit too easy to push over, in my view, but still acceptable"}
{"source": " When I discovered that I still had to open all three legs a bit more, I retried it and it was much more steady"}
{"source": " That last 1/4\" (6"}
{"source": "3mm) of movement on each leg was worth 100% improvement"}
{"source": " The stand is fully as steady as I had hoped it possibly could be, especially given the price"}
{"source": " Amazing"}
{"source": "Anyway, I gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all"}
{"source": " I even like the way it appears to physically clamp down my guitarr&oacute;n since it seemed to discourage itchy fingers from trying to pick it up while I was on break"}
{"source": "Works like its supposed to"}
{"source": " No complaints at all for the price"}
{"source": " I will be buying more in the future"}
{"source": "Last week I ordered a Guardian Electric Guitar Stand (A-Shape, Black) Price: $10"}
{"source": "99 from Amazon based on an average 4-star review"}
{"source": "  I read the reviews first and placed the order, for a cheap, collapsible guitar stand for my electric guitars and bass"}
{"source": "  When I got the stand and opened it for the first time and tried to put my Fender Jazz bass on it - lol - no way"}
{"source": "  Worthless, and it's now holding my son's 3/4 size classical guitar (barely)"}
{"source": "Undaunted, I ordered this Musician's Gear stand"}
{"source": "  Less expensive than the Guardian, it holds my Gibson CS-356 Custom with no problem and I would trust it with any and all of my electric guitars or basses"}
{"source": "  The bottom piece that supports the body of the guitar rotates, and that's a little strange (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but with a little care you can put a guitar into it and remove it with little or no attention to placement"}
{"source": " For $8, you can't beat it"}
{"source": "JM Tepper"}
{"source": "this is a great product"}
{"source": " very light, very sturdy and at a low price"}
{"source": "  well worth the investment"}
{"source": "There isn't much to get excited about in a guitar stand, however, it does it's job and the price was right"}
{"source": " I purchased four and they were all delivered on time"}
{"source": " Each adjusted to, and held, its guitar securely"}
{"source": " I have found the stand to be very stable"}
{"source": " The welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job"}
{"source": " My music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much"}
{"source": " It's does not appear to be of better quality"}
{"source": "I now have two of these (really wish now I had ordered more at the time before the slight price increase -kicks self-) and all I can say - you simply can't beat it"}
{"source": "  I also have a Hercules Tri-stand (10x more expensive than this one), and between the two, gotta admit, the only major advantage my tri-stand has is saving space (which actually is a huge consideration for me)"}
{"source": "  I honestly don't know why other reviewers have had such a hard time with balance as the two Musician's Gear Tubular Guitar Stands I currently own never once have given me an issue (aside from bodily running INTO the thing), and they have held/do hold a variety: Guitars of various styles, Banjos (both open back and BG resonator), Mandolas, anything with a long neck"}
{"source": " All in all, unless there is some specialized stand need, I would first come to Musician's Gear"}
{"source": "This is a great item because it is small, lightweight and portable and it clips on anywhere (guitar, mic stand etc"}
{"source": ") At the same time, because it is so lightweight it is prone to breakage if you give it hard use and don't pack it carefully when traveling etc"}
{"source": "  The clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong"}
{"source": "  The clip that goes to the mic stand is also strong but if you leave it on the stand for months at a time it will weaken and start to slide if you put more than 1-2 sheets of paper on the clip board"}
{"source": " This doesn't happen tho if you remove the clip at the end of the gig, day etc"}
{"source": "  For this price it's a good buy in my opinion and with a little care, you will get more than your money's worth out of it"}
{"source": "i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal"}
{"source": "  the clipboard is small and wont hold more than a few sheets but is great for holding a set list and one or two sheets of lyrics or chord charts"}
{"source": "  i hang it down from the boom and it is inconspicuous and suits my needs just fine so far"}
{"source": "These a cheaply made with corrugated plastic, however they are surprisingly durable"}
{"source": " THESE ARE NOT 8"}
{"source": "5x11 (paper size)"}
{"source": " They are about half-sheet size"}
{"source": "Right product at the right price"}
{"source": "  I have 20-25 of these dang things layin around cause I never throw them out"}
{"source": "  but never fails I need one I don't have(to drive a zoom pedal to save on batteries), and here it was"}
{"source": "Nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesn't work"}
{"source": "  Well,"}
{"source": "that's not the case here"}
{"source": "  This power supply is well made (durable) and performs to the specs supplied"}
{"source": "  I guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configuration,"}
{"source": "but why go to all that trouble?  This product lives up to it's calling"}
{"source": "  Besides, who wants to keep changing batteries in the Stobe Tuner (Planet Waves) when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget"}
{"source": "  I gave it a 5-star rating because the price is fair, the product is well made and works, and it was shipped well within the promised time"}
{"source": "  By today's standards, that's as good as it gets"}
{"source": "DP"}
{"source": "From the moment I started using this, I noticed a radio signal overlay when used with my mini amp and headphones"}
{"source": "Someone snagged the first one, they must have wanted it more than I did"}
{"source": " The first one worked great and so does this one"}
{"source": " I would recommend this product to everybody"}
{"source": "This works well"}
{"source": "A few cons:1"}
{"source": " it is not variable speed"}
{"source": " on/off in either direction with full torque"}
{"source": " Not so bad"}
{"source": " but variable speed would have been nice"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " it is a little loud"}
{"source": "Other than that"}
{"source": " does what it should as expected"}
{"source": "Here's what you'll need to know about this product if you're interested in getting one"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": "  The 'head' accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due to the slot config"}
{"source": "  That's a good thing"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": "  The trigger is a rocker switch"}
{"source": " so you can wind and unwind,"}
{"source": "quickly"}
{"source": "  That's a good thing, for the most part"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": "  It is not variable speed"}
{"source": "  One speed"}
{"source": "  FAST RPM!  It takes some practice and patience"}
{"source": "  Nothing special, just the will to get used to it"}
{"source": "  Initially, and until you get used to it, you'll have the head jumping off the peg"}
{"source": "  Don't 'fret' (bad pun)"}
{"source": " a few minutes of rehearsal with it and you'll get to like it"}
{"source": "  I've opted to pull the trigger in short bursts so as to refrain from having a string change remind you of a NASCAR tire change in the pit"}
{"source": " and especially because when you get close to the desired tension you need to go slowly so as not to over-run it"}
{"source": "I would have much preferred a device that has a two-position switch"}
{"source": " 'slow' and 'fast' position on the trigger for more control"}
{"source": "  I've rated it 4-stars, not 5, not because there is anything 'wrong' with it or that it doesn't work"}
{"source": "  It does all that the advertisements say it will"}
{"source": "  It's the aspect of the device I had to find out the hard way that keeps me from giving it a 'perfect' score"}
{"source": "All in all, be patient and all will be well"}
{"source": "  Realistically, I don't need to change a set of strings in just a couple of minutes"}
{"source": " I've got hours if I chose to"}
{"source": "  I suspect most folks are in the same position"}
{"source": "  If you're a 'roadie' for a big group, I could see the need,"}
{"source": "the need for speed"}
{"source": " But, alas, I'm not"}
{"source": "  So, like some of the other things I've purchased along the way, I now have a new toy"}
{"source": "  I works"}
{"source": "  I'm satisfied"}
{"source": " for now"}
{"source": "DP"}
{"source": "I'm so glad Ernie Ball decided to put out this tool"}
{"source": " I've been using the manual kind for years and have been tempted in the past to get an attachment for my cordless drill"}
{"source": " The reason I never did was that I was worried it would be too powerful for that purpose"}
{"source": " This is made for string changing with just enough power and speed for the job and the right head to fit all kinds of tuners"}
{"source": " I love it!"}
{"source": "Earnie Ball's guitar strap locks are great"}
{"source": " in my opinion, the best there way over other brands like Dunlop, Schaller and many others"}
{"source": " I have them installed on my Les Paul Axcess and my Jackson Dinky and they are very secure both when rehearsing and gigging"}
{"source": " You can definetely trust them to do their job"}
{"source": " They also look great"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": "I had looked around for strap locks for my Dean Dime Razorback, and was not happy to see that most locking mechanisms were designed with a button on top to release them"}
{"source": "  My guitar straps attach on the rear and underside of the guitar which would be easy to accidentally press when the guitar hits my waist causing unknown horrible damage"}
{"source": "Then I saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation"}
{"source": "  I installed them last night and could not be happier"}
{"source": "  They are very solid and the lock is 'positive' so you can feel the click when it is set"}
{"source": "  I am sure they will work well if your guitar straps mount in the traditional spots as well"}
{"source": "  This is a great product at a good price"}
{"source": "Note:  If you are installing on a Dean Razorback or ML, the stock front strap mount screw goes through the plate, body into the neck"}
{"source": "DO NOT USE this to mount, or pull the old strap mount off and return the screw"}
{"source": "it is too long and will likely split your neck"}
{"source": "  Just drill a hole right next to it and install the locking mount right next to it (it can touch it even and still function properly)"}

{"source": "I got this Duet2 instead of the single-light version as most Kindle users do"}
{"source": "  So far I really like it, cuz it really brightens up the screen and makes it easier to read, even better than day light"}
{"source": "  The only trick is to arrange the two lights on the sides of the screen to not having to see the reflection"}
{"source": "The AC adapter is a great money saver, as I usually read 5-6 hours at night, and burning up 3 AAA batteries each night is not really a solution :)If you have a Kindle DX, I would strongly recommend this Duet2 instead of the single light version, cuz there's almost twice as much screen to cover"}
{"source": "Of course, I also use this on on my music stand beside reading on the Kindle"}
{"source": "  It's a versatile light source, and I really like it a lot"}
{"source": "Have not used the light as much as I thought I might, but it works okay"}
{"source": " Each light has multiple, independent settings"}
{"source": " The beams are narrow, but you get two of them"}
{"source": "The major downside is that they sometimes turn on if they are carried with other things in your bag"}
{"source": " Something in the bag will trigger the switch, and the light may be on for hours without you knowing it"}
{"source": " There is no good way to prevent this other than to take the batteries out of the light during transport"}
{"source": "Also, you cannot really tell from the product picture, but the clip is best used for narrow or thin objects"}
{"source": " It does not work well (or at all) with object more than 1/4 inch thick"}
{"source": "Not as bright as I would like them; however, very nice"}
{"source": "  I can practice without lighting up the whole house"}
{"source": "  I'm glad that I bought it"}
{"source": "This light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely"}
{"source": "  The light from the LEDs has a blue tint to it"}
{"source": " I'd prefer something more 'white'"}
{"source": " Each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting"}
{"source": " I gave 4 starts because it doesn't get quite as bright as I'd like but it does the job"}
{"source": "  It seems well-made and will operate off battery power as well as an AC adapter which is included"}
{"source": "I already own aMighty Bright LED Book Light with one lighting head, but I bought this light as a semi-permanent fixture on myDocument/Book Holder, which is mounted on anarticulating arm(took a little DIY'ing)"}
{"source": "This music light has one drawback; it doesn't have a master switch"}
{"source": " To turn on both lights, you would have to independently turn on the switch atop each light head (two switch presses)"}
{"source": " To turn off both lights, you would have to independently double-click each light head (four switch presses) -- the first press brings the light to a lower level and the second press turns it off (each light head has two light levels: bright and medium-bright -- for a total 4 illumination combinations)"}
{"source": "I use this light for music sheets, documents, and books"}
{"source": " The &#34;mighty bright&#34; label is no misnomer to be sure; these lights ARE mighty bright"}
{"source": " They provide more than enough illumination to make even smaller texts readable in low ambient light conditions"}
{"source": " Each light head provides very even illumination for a letter size sheet (the light starts to get dimmer just beyond the fringes of the sheet), so two light heads will provide sufficient illumination for a good-sized area"}
{"source": " It will simultaneously illuminate the verso and recto of even the largest books"}
{"source": " The flexible goose necks of the music light allows you to easily position the lights to reduce glare (which is inevitable on glossy or semi-glossy pages)"}
{"source": "This music light is a mighty sweet deal because:(1) it comes with anAC Adapter(which doesn't come with the book light with a single lighting head and has to be purchased separately)"}
{"source": " The adapter works on both this music light and the book light with a single lighting head"}
{"source": "(2) contrary to the product description, this music light DOES come with 3 AAA batteries (at least mine did)"}
{"source": "Important Note: If you switch from using batteries to using the AC Adapter, the 3 AAA batteries will first have to be removed from the battery housing or the light(s) won't power on"}
{"source": "I picked this music light over theMighty Bright Orchestra Lightbecause:(1) I've had my single head book light for many years and I trust this book light to offer the same durability (both lights are indistinguishable save for the single/dual light heads)(2) two goose necks offer more lighting flexibility(3) this music light is about half the price of the orchestra light"}
{"source": "---The Bottom Line: The lack of a master switch on this music light makes turning on/off the lights somewhat of a hassle (an unfortunate but tolerable drawback)"}
{"source": " All the same, this music light is very functional, and as far as durability is concerned, I'm quite confident that it will last me for many years to come (it has the same build quality as my Mighty Bright single-head book light, which I've had for many years)"}
{"source": " Recommended!"}
{"source": "This is a fairly compact &#34;must have&#34; accessory when working in pit or dim light situations"}
{"source": " This music light will easily cover two pages of  music and at a stretch, three pages"}
{"source": "The LEDs provide bright , white even coverage making it possible to see the pages of music"}
{"source": " The heads are easily adjusted with the flexible mounting arms and the two stage light intensity switch is a good feature when a lesser intensity light is desired"}
{"source": "The small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling"}
{"source": "I love this light"}
{"source": " It runs on electric so no need for batteries"}
{"source": " The goosenecks are metal and well made and the LED lights have switches that can turn on single or double LEDs on each side"}
{"source": " It will clip on anything you want to hold it"}
{"source": " It's simple, well made and works great"}
{"source": "My home practice area is in a rather dark corner with limited room, and I have this clipped onto my music stand"}
{"source": " Illuminates the music far better than the previous ones I had used, including one that used a full sized bulb (rather too much light and not very portable)"}
{"source": " Have no trouble that others have mentioned, just it loses a star because the included ac adapter cord is *short*, making it for all intents and purposes useless to me without having to string along an extension cord to my music stand (ugh, more cords)"}
{"source": "I use this microphone mainly to record music"}
{"source": " Occasionally I use it for voice chat where it supposedly excels in quality compared to desktop USB microphones"}
{"source": " I think the best way to describe this microphone is that it is &#34;above average&#34; but does not outperform any higher-end non-USB microphones that I have played with in the past"}
{"source": " While it is not an &#34;outstanding&#34; microphone, it's still a great entry-level product for those on a budget"}
{"source": "The microphone is relatively easy to use (just plug in the USB cable) but it needs some accessories to be efficient"}
{"source": " For instance, the stand that comes with the microphone cannot hold the microphone upright"}
{"source": " It seems like it will tip over if you breathe on it the wrong way"}
{"source": " Remember to buy a solid desk (or floor) stand for the microphone, as well as a shock mount and a pop filter"}
{"source": "I am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment"}
{"source": " Paired up with a nice pop filter, this mic is able to produce some amazing vocal recordings"}
{"source": " You'd be surprised to find out how many famous youtube musicians or podcast creators use this mic"}
{"source": " It took me some time to get the hang of miking amps, positions and vocal distance, but I am truly getting more than my money's worth for what it's putting out"}
{"source": " Check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing"}
{"source": " I am very glad I made this purchase"}
{"source": "I've owned this mic for 2 years if you're curious about durability"}
{"source": "I was looking for a better quality Mic but not willing to pay a high price to sing on the Internet"}
{"source": "  This was a low price and high quality solution"}
{"source": "  Nothing to load and I was singing right out of the box"}
{"source": "It does pick up noise around me since this is a condenser mic but, that just means you pick a quiet place to record"}
{"source": " LOL"}
{"source": "This is the best USB Condenser mic I've ever used"}
{"source": "  I needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be XLR"}
{"source": "  I bought the AT2020 XLR version, simply due to the fantastic results I've achieved with this one"}
{"source": "I only use this microphone for podcasting"}
{"source": "  I do not record music with it, but I haven't tried yet"}
{"source": "  If you're curious as to the sound quality, listen to my podcast \"Rock Crushes Paper\" on iTunes and Zune Marketplace"}

{"source": "  The only knock I have on this is the little tripod stand"}
{"source": "  Yes, it's a tripod stand, but I can't imagine actually being in a spot where I'd rather use that then the On-Stage desktop mic stand"}
{"source": "Anyways, great mic"}
{"source": "  Can't recommend it enough"}
{"source": "  It's made me check out other Audio-Technica products"}
{"source": "Great sound and sensitivity"}
{"source": " Very well made"}
{"source": " These should last a lifetime barring any physical damage"}
{"source": " Made in the USA to boot! These may not be the cheapest but they are worth every penny!"}
{"source": "these wires definatly change the sound of the snare, drasticly improving sound, as well as looks"}

{"source": " This is totally different, it's the real thing"}
{"source": " Made of wood, very good looking and powerfull sound"}

{"source": "I have not tested other micro amps, this does for what I bought it for, to practice at home or anywhere without disturbing and easy transport, it's very portable to take with you"}
{"source": " I really like the overdrive sound, the tuner works really well, I dont like much the clean channel it breaks up fast to a not so clean channel, but overall its a great product, so if you need a good tone, and a very portable micro amp you can give this one a try, it's great"}
{"source": "I've been a musician for most of my life, playing primarily keyboards recently in the studio and with bands, saxophone and a little bass guitar"}
{"source": " I've owned a six string guitar for 20+ years that has seen very little use"}
{"source": " I had this misconception that my hands &#34;just weren't designed to play guitar&#34;"}
{"source": " But recently my life changed a little bit"}
{"source": " I have a young boy that's now master of my universe, a lot less room to leave musical gadgets lying about, and I now live in an apartment building where making a lot of noise tends to be frowned upon"}
{"source": "I picked up this Micro Crush because I was originally looking for a micro Marshall and I saw this pop up"}
{"source": " I knew I already liked the sound of Orange amps (better than Marshall given my druthers of musical taste) and for $69 it seemed like not much of a reach to try it out for myself"}
{"source": "Shortly after a small package of value came to me with this charmingly tiny amp in it"}
{"source": " My son's mom thought it was a toy &#34;it's so small!&#34; Yes you might think so until you plug it in"}
{"source": " The idea here is to sound loud without being loud"}
{"source": " This amp is perfect for that"}
{"source": "Most of the time I have this thing turned up to about 1, 1 1/2, rarely up to 2 or beyond"}
{"source": " I've got a simple effect chain going in: EH Soul Preacher (compressor/sustainer) -&#62; MX Analog delay -&#62; Cheap (but pleasant) Chinese Phaser -&#62; EH Holy Grail -&#62; Amp"}
{"source": " I use this as my &#34;clean&#34; sound without the overdrive"}
{"source": " It is beautiful"}
{"source": " A little Dick Dale-ish"}
{"source": " Then when I want a little edge I turn off the phaser and delay and turn on the overdrive"}
{"source": " Maybe nudge down the volume a little more and I can rock AC/DC licks at midnight without raising complaints from the neighbors"}

{"source": " So I play while I'm watching football or baseball"}
{"source": " I play while I'm watching the news"}
{"source": " I play while I'm playing Crazy 8's with my son"}
{"source": " I play morning, noon and night"}
{"source": " Not only that but I'm actually getting to be not-that-bad at playing either"}
{"source": " Lots of playing/practice seems to inevitably make on better (hint: do those finger exercises too, they work)"}
{"source": "So I am not exaggerating when I reiterate my headline: this little amp changed my life (for the better)"}
{"source": "Best buy for under $100 I've made since I bought my son his Strider balance bike"}
{"source": " Which is orange too!"}
{"source": "I'm very satisfied with the performance of the CM-2"}
{"source": "  With a few tweaking, I could emulate the sound I get from my Fulltone OCD"}
{"source": "  I'd say it's very versatile because there are two seperate controls for low & high frequencies unlike most pedals with just the \"Tone\" control"}
{"source": "  A toggle switch lets you choose between \"classic\" & \"modified\" setting"}
{"source": "  A tweaker's delight!  The \"level\" knob has a lot of juice"}
{"source": "  If you set it at 10 or 11 o'clock, it's plenty loud enough"}
{"source": "  Although you can't use it as a clean boost because it gives off a little gain even if you set the \"gain\" knob to zero"}
{"source": "  If you have a single coil, it may sound like your tube amp is just breaking up, not so for humbuckers (too much gain)"}
{"source": "  You can also stack the CM-2 with other pedals"}
{"source": "  I dusted my old Boss DS-1 and run it along with the CM-2 and was able to get some good tones"}
{"source": "  The DS-1 usually hurts my ears but with the CM-2 behind it, sweet!  The Hardwire CM-2 may not be exotic as the boutique offerings from Klon, Zvex or LovePedal, but it will get the job done at a significantly lower cost"}
{"source": "  It's well built, will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to"}
{"source": "  There may be others better but they cost more than twice the price but not twice as good"}
{"source": "  Try it, you can't go wrong!UPDATE:  Did a full comparison between the CM-2, Fulltone OCD & Joyo Crunch Distortion"}
{"source": "GAIN:  Joyo obviously has the most gain followed closely by the CM-2 and OCD, 3rd"}
{"source": "MIX:  The CM-2 has the most amount of control with separate high & low controls, followed by the OCD with just a tone control and the Joyo Crunch more or less sounds the same no matter what position you put the tone control"}
{"source": "  Since the CM-2 has the widest tone range, I can make it behave like a Treble Booster!NUANCE:  The OCD cleans up well when you roll down the volume control on your guitar and is very dynamic"}
{"source": "  The CM-2 is a close second and the Joyo Crunch, being strictly a distortion pedal is far behind"}
{"source": "If you're anything like me, then I know what you're thinking: Digitech= Digital, fake-sounding junk"}
{"source": " Not anymore"}
{"source": " The Digitech HardWire CM-2 finishes what Digitech began with the Bad Monkey, which is a great overdrive pedal in its own right"}
{"source": " But the CM-2 offers tone quality that compares to the best on the market (and as a pedal maniac, I've owned wayyyy too many overdrive and distortion pedals, so in all humility, I know what I'm talking about) and flexibility that is rivaled by none in the market for anything close to the price"}
{"source": "What makes the CM-2 so great is that, like several other reviews have mentioned, it's not just another tube-screamer clone"}
{"source": " There is no distinct mid-range hump and slightly rolled off bass that tubescreamers (particularly the TS-9) are known to have"}
{"source": " There is a lot of range to all the knobs; the level can add some serious boost, bass and treble knobs allow you to significantly change your tone if that's what you're after, or you can dial it to be more (but never completely) transparent"}
{"source": " Also, the CM-2 has more gain on tap than most overdrive pedals; you can go from basically a clean boost to adding a surprising amount of saturation to your tone"}
{"source": " Lastly, the classic vs"}
{"source": " modified switch gives you the option of adding some gain and bass by switching from classic to modified"}
{"source": "I've tested the CM-2 as both an overdrive to a clean channel Fender Hotrod Deville, and as a front-end boost to my Bugera 1990 (basically a Marshall JCM 900)"}
{"source": " The CM-2 sounds great in both applications"}
{"source": " Over the clean channel of the Fender, it sounds very full and smooth"}
{"source": " Even turned all the way up, the overdrive never sounded very \"grainy\" or fuzzy; it maintained warmed, organic, and tube-like"}
{"source": " \"Boutique-esque\" is how I would characterize it"}
{"source": " Great for blues playing, and I'm sure that playing with the tone knobs you could dial in some good country tones as well"}
{"source": "However, I use it more as a front-end boost to my already-overdriven Bugera amp"}
{"source": " In front of the lead channel, CM-2 serves to take my tone from hard-rock crunch territory to a more metal tone, with chunky bass and roaring highs that make palm-muted riffs sound as at home as if they were coming through a Peavey 6505"}
{"source": "As a conclusion, I'm really pleased with the quality of the Digitech CM-2"}
{"source": " Both the sound and build quality are top-notch, and for a price similar to or less than most quality overdrive pedals on the market, I highly recommend checking out the CM-2"}
{"source": "This is the one pedal I can't do without"}
{"source": " You can sculpt your guitar tone before it hits your amp, and that's the key to getting a tight rhythm tone at high gain"}
{"source": " So if I encounter an amp that isn't tight enough, or the high gain distortion doesn't sound good by itself, I just turn down the gain or use a lower gain channel, and then hit it hard with this pedal"}
{"source": " Sounds so much better than the internal high gain distortion"}
{"source": "Alright, so here are some things you might want to know before you buy:* The gain knob when turned to zero still produces overdrive"}
{"source": " So you can't use this as a *clean* boost pedal"}
{"source": " With high output humbuckers, you still get some mild tube-like overdrive at zero gain"}
{"source": " But this isn't advertised as a clean boost pedal"}
{"source": "* So how much gain / distortion does this pedal have if you're going into a clean channel of an amp?  Plenty for classic rock and blues"}
{"source": " Not enough for metal, though if you crank the gain and high knob all the way you can just barely get a prog style metal tone"}
{"source": " But it's not a distortion pedal, it's just an overdrive"}
{"source": "* This thing uses tiny SMC components in the circuitry and therefore isn't really moddable"}
{"source": "* Unlike the Bad Monkey, this doesn't have an additional mixer / cabinet emulated output"}
{"source": "* Like a tube screamer, it boosts the mids and reduces the bass so that going into a mushy sounding tube channel you get a tighter distorted sound"}
{"source": " Anyone who has a nice warm amp and gets this pedal thinking they'll get more of the same, may be disappointed"}
{"source": " What they need instead is a transparent clean boost pedal that keeps their guitar the same tone just louder volume"}
{"source": "* The classic/modified switch is pretty cool"}
{"source": " I have two guitars, one is kind of bassy and scooped sounding, the other is bright and middy"}
{"source": " Well, using the switch, I can make one come out more equivalent to the other when needed"}
{"source": " This keeps me from adjusting my amp each time I switch guitars"}
{"source": " Classic is a slightly lower gain, more mid-boosted sound"}
{"source": " Quite tight"}
{"source": " Think Peavey 6505 EQ structure"}
{"source": " Modified is more scooped, saturated"}
{"source": " Think Mesa EQ structure"}
{"source": " So this switch is a useful little bonus"}
{"source": "*  It eats batteries, sucking in around 150 mA at 9V, so my 300 mAH rechargeable lasts 1"}
{"source": "5-2 hrs"}
{"source": " I swear if that blue LED weren't so bright it would probably get an extra hour"}
{"source": " Instead of getting an adapter, I got an 8-battery AA clip, 9V battery clip, 12V DC plug, and 8 Sanyo Eneloop batteries"}
{"source": " Hooked it up with negative tip, positive sleeve and now I have a 16,000 mAH monster = about 100 hours play time"}
{"source": "This pedal is perfect"}
{"source": " You get what it's advertised to do"}
{"source": " It's rugged, looks good"}
{"source": " I haven't found it to be noisy at all, unless there was something wrong with my guitar (strings not grounded through the bridge, etc"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": " Someone mentioned the silver tops of the dials falling off as if they were decals, but I looked and the knobs seem like all one solid piece to me"}
{"source": "Another thing I found is that instead of using an overdrive plugin in my DAW, if I use this real overdrive pedal in front of my interface, that magically makes all hum / noise from my pickups go away"}
{"source": "Overall, yes I highly recommend this, and would suggest people check out the Hardwire Metal Distortion if they want something as a standalone rather than an overdrive into a crunchy amp"}
{"source": " Like others, though, I can't stop playing through this"}
{"source": " Great purchase, especially if bought used"}
{"source": "The CM-2 is magnificent: [1] It produces beautiful overdrive (one that doesn't destroy your guitar's tone)"}
{"source": " [2] It has independent \"High\" and \"Low\" tone controls, and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes--thus allowing for great versatility in tone-manipulation"}
{"source": " [3] It features a switch that allows you to pick between \"classic\" overdrive and an extra blast of distortion (\"modified\")"}
{"source": " [4] The case is made of metal"}
{"source": " [5] It comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal"}
{"source": " This pedal will not give you \"metal\" distortion; for that consider Digitech's TL-2"}
{"source": " Instead, it produces a warm, old-time overdriven tone"}
{"source": " I love this thing!"}
{"source": "Most of the other reviews have pretty much covered just about everything I would say however I still want to say I love this tool"}
{"source": " Not being someone who has had a lot of theory under my belt, it's been useful to help me learn the letters of keys"}
{"source": " Slowly I am making progress at memorizing key signatures so that I know where I am on the fretboard & where I can go from there"}
{"source": " I use it by putting it on my music stand, dialing in the key I want, turn on the drum machine & simply play the chords in that key to the beat"}
{"source": " Then when I want to practice the relevant scales of the key, I simply look at the letters and count the fingering for the corresponding note"}
{"source": " It's that easy"}
{"source": "I will say that I do agree that the instructions are a wee bit too thin for my taste but music notation & theory is not a subject that the average player is adept with"}
{"source": " Most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned"}
{"source": " To really grasp it, one simply has to plod along actually performing the exercises repeatedly"}
{"source": " But with rote repetition, eventually comes that \"Eureka!\" moment from time to time & more falls into place"}
{"source": "Unlike some others, I'm not one to lug something this around in my gig bag"}
{"source": " Who really is going to set & study material like this prior to a gig? That's what you do at home and it's called 'Practice' for a reason"}
{"source": "I give this 5 out of 5 stars because it really is a fantastic learning tool & is relatively simple to use as long as you have some inkling of music theory"}
{"source": " If not, you may want to take some lessons & then use this as a study guide along with your regular lessons"}
{"source": "Yeah I kind of bought it on a whim, it's confusing as hell first of all"}
{"source": " I don't really understand it but it was shipped and explained perfectly as described"}
{"source": " :)"}
{"source": "This is a very useful and quite educational musician's piece"}
{"source": " I especially like the way it is presented and how easy it is to use"}
{"source": " It easily helps remember all possible scales and shows many tricks for your musical compositions"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": " Cheers!"}
{"source": "I love this little device!I'm an amateur musician so I'm on and off on playing"}
{"source": " I play enough I need to know theory, but not so often I don't forget the specifics"}
{"source": "This gizmo lets me refresh all of those pesky details with the slide of a tab"}
{"source": "I don't believe this is a tool to teach people music theory, but it is a wonderful reference once you know what you're looking for"}
{"source": "For example, I'm playing with the harmonica now"}
{"source": " Simple little instrument right? Well that simple little instrument has you thinking about major, minor, major pentatonic, minor pentatonic, and blues scales in 12 different keys! One section of this wheel lists all of these different scales"}
{"source": " Rotate the dial to the key you're interested in and the individual notes for each of these scales in the key you've selected appears"}
{"source": " Nice"}
{"source": "Although I play guitar, I find the other side of the wheel less helpful"}
{"source": " Yes it does show you how to play diatonic chords (MmmMMmD)but they are barre chords based upon the \"E\" chord"}
{"source": " If you understand the formation of an E barre chord and its family (E, Em, E7, Esus, Esus4, etc), this may not be so helpful"}
{"source": " I really don't use E barre chords much beyond the 7 fret as I usually switch to the \"A\" type barre chord based off of the 5th string so my hand has much less distance to travel"}
{"source": " I've not found anything to support these \"A\" type barre chords nor the others: D, G, C"}
{"source": "I find the music theory side of the wheel worth the price and the disillusionment with the guitar side my be due to my ignorance"}
{"source": "Tons of useful information on this wheel"}
{"source": " My only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written"}
{"source": " Seems like reasonably durable construction"}
{"source": " Compact enough to stow it in a guitar case"}
{"source": "The only complaint that I have is the instructions they are kind of shallow, if you have musical theory background you should not have much trouble, I'm no expert I have a some knowledge beyond basic, and it's really helpfull to take some reference learning new things, visualize quickly chords, scales, mayor and minor scales, you can view there relationship it's a great tool to learn, if you have deep knowledge maybe you dont need it"}
{"source": " For complete begginers it might be difficult to start without reading and taking time to study"}
{"source": " This is a great complement to study theory"}
{"source": "This is a fantastic product that is well made"}
{"source": " The plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use"}
{"source": " This ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition"}
{"source": "The tool is extremely useful"}
{"source": " I have just started playing with a band, and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in"}
{"source": " With the wheel, I immediately know what chords to choose from"}
{"source": " I also know what notes are in each chord"}
{"source": " In addition, it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing"}
{"source": "The wheel is also invaluable for switching keys"}
{"source": " For example, say you're playing the I, IV, and V chords in the key of C"}
{"source": ", but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in Bb"}
{"source": " All you need to do is dial the wheel to Bb, find out the new I, IV, and V chords, and start playing"}
{"source": " The wheel makes chord transposition a breeze"}
{"source": "I feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair"}
{"source": " This is a very useful product at a fair price"}
{"source": "No, I am not affiliated with the company at all"}
{"source": " I'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool"}
{"source": "In my opinion, this is a five star product"}
{"source": "I'm a songwriter who is always looking for compatible chords"}
{"source": " This wheel has made if fun to find chords that work well together, its quick and easy to use"}
{"source": "This educational device is truly an asset to all musicians, especially guitar players"}
{"source": "  Because it gives complete scales, and notations at a moments glance I find it extremely helpful when my hands are busy, but my mind is wandering"}
{"source": "I am confused by this hellish portal of confusion"}
{"source": " Looking at it makes me ill - I feel like it's laughing at me, with its indecipherable scribbles"}
{"source": "I am self taught, and this pup is essential for tune writing, finding quickie relative minors and such"}
{"source": "If you want to understand any theory, start here after learning basic chords"}
{"source": "This is how basic chords relate to each other"}
{"source": "Yeah, Baby"}
{"source": " If you're boss, you need the Info"}
{"source": "-Austin Powers?"}
{"source": "Let me start of by saying this tuner is great"}
{"source": "My previous tuner was a Korg CA-40 and frankly, that tuner is terrible"}
{"source": "The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not"}
{"source": "CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not"}
{"source": "SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto"}
{"source": "SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": " 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves"}
{"source": "SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not"}
{"source": "What made me get a new tuner is how finicky the CA-40 when using the build-in mic"}
{"source": " The needle on the graph just jumps all over the place from the harmonics of the guitar and that has nothing to do the sensitivity or accuracy of the tuner"}
{"source": " Yes, it is accurate but so are many of the tuners out there that do not have such a poor usability"}
{"source": " Another issue with the CA-40 is the poor screen"}
{"source": " The screen is so dark and only viewable head on"}
{"source": "The CA-40 does not have any of the flaws of the CA-40 and is even more accurate"}
{"source": "What this tuner has: accuracy, usability, durability, versatility"}
{"source": " What more can you ask from a tuner of this price?"}
{"source": "Over the years, I've literally owned dozens of electronic tuners"}
{"source": "generally five or six at a time in various locations"}
{"source": "ranging from a $12 Musiciansfriend promotional item to a $200 rack mount"}
{"source": " Most have been in the $30 range from Sabine, Yamaha, Korg, and Seiko"}
{"source": " The Seiko SAT800E is my all time favorite because, like Mama Bear in the fairy tale, it affordably splits the difference between \"too small\" and \"too big\""}
{"source": " It stays put on the floor when I run it inline between my guitar/bass/uke and my amp and its LCD display is large enough to be legible when I'm standing"}
{"source": " At the same time, it neatly fits in my ukulele case"}
{"source": " Beyond that, it simply does what good electronic tuners do, accurately and without fanfare"}
{"source": " Bravo"}
{"source": "I teach class guitar in a community college and bought the SAT800 to loan to students during class"}
{"source": " I selected it for the rubber bumpers and beefy build, expecting anything in this day and age to nail pitch quickly and accurately"}
{"source": " And, indeed, it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching"}
{"source": " Oddly, in one year of use, nobody has dropped it so the bumpers also provide a sure grip in hand and on music stand"}
{"source": " My prior smooth plastic Seiko cost four times as much as the SAT800 but managed to hit the deck several times a week"}
{"source": " Amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students"}
{"source": " However, the display was larger and sported colored note names, so it was more intuitive for beginner use"}
{"source": "The built-in mic works fine in a quiet room but is useless in a classroom full of guitars (as are all built-in tuner mics)"}
{"source": " You need to use a tuner pickup and all is well (I use a Korg tuner pickup)"}
{"source": " If I were to nick pick I'd have to say the letter name of the pitch is way too small on the LCD"}
{"source": " It's tucked in the far right corner in 12 point type and positioned just after the octave number"}
{"source": " A lot of students can't read or notice such small type"}
{"source": " Also the octave number immediately in front of the letter confuses many beginners as they assume it is the string number (doesn't matter how many times I explain that it isn't)"}
{"source": " Finally, it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch"}
{"source": " Nearly every week somebody inadvertently sets it to A435 or whatever and causes a bunch of other students to be out of tune"}
{"source": " A lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade"}
{"source": " Most of these nick picks don't apply to pros or advanced players but are something to consider if you're a novice"}
{"source": "Add a calibrate safety feature and double the pitch name size and this would be a 5 star product"}
{"source": " Right now it's a mere 4"}
{"source": "5!"}
{"source": "This is my first guitar tuner, I don't have expiriance to determine: do this tuner is better then other tuners"}
{"source": " Is working very good, 100% satisfaction"}
{"source": "Rugged, good looking, efficient"}
{"source": "sorta like me"}
{"source": " Have several tuners of different names and quality"}
{"source": " But this Seiko is certainly the quickest"}
{"source": " The rubber housing is an excellent idea"}
{"source": " Would buy another"}
{"source": "It's a pop filter"}
{"source": " In case one wasn't good enough, they double it up! Works great"}
{"source": " No complaints whatsoever"}
{"source": " No need for a fancy pansy $50 metal mesh screen"}
{"source": " This works just as good"}
{"source": "Pop filters already work great to block out wind and other unwanted noises from a microphone"}
{"source": " And this with that extra filter on it, it blocks even more"}
{"source": " It's simply amazing"}
{"source": " Worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter"}
{"source": " If I want I can blow directly into the filters and it'll block all wind from the microphone and will only pick up soundwaves"}
{"source": "They are not designed with a switch to have all lights on at the same time"}
{"source": " So if you need that sort of control on your lights this will not do it"}
{"source": " They are fairly bright and the lightweight metal body is nice"}
{"source": "I own the older Color Bank with the bulbs and it works better that this one"}
{"source": " I love the size, weight and LED bulbs on this one though"}
{"source": " It has a nice color throw too"}
{"source": " It also has speed control and audio control just like the older model but"}
{"source": "this new LED version is built with less quality"}
{"source": " When you turn both speed controls all the way down to the lowest settings, the bulbs still keep flashing to the next one, about every second"}
{"source": " They do not stop flashing when it's plugged in since it don't have an on/off switch"}
{"source": " If you are using this on a switcher, then it wouldn't be a problem"}
{"source": "I'd prefer the light to stop when the music stops, but it don't"}
{"source": " When you try to adjust the audio flashing, it is so sensitive to sound that the lights just keep flashing very fast in rotation"}
{"source": "Also the circuit board inside is held to the metal panel by 4 plastic pegs sticking through the back"}
{"source": " They will stick your hand and eventually get pushed inside and the small circuit board will move around"}
{"source": " Within 1 hour of getting it, I had to take it apart, push the plastic pegs back through the holes and melt them with a hot knife so they would stay in place"}
{"source": "I love the light but it's not as useful to me since it's \"always\" flashing"}
{"source": " It's possible I have a defective one, not sure"}
{"source": "The cool bright LED bulbs are the best part of this light"}
{"source": "***UPDATE,  I played with one of these in the store and it actually worked better"}
{"source": " When you turn it all the down, the lights stopped flashing until the music started again"}
{"source": " The one I have never stops flashing, even when the music stops"}
{"source": " I guess I got a bad one"}
{"source": "I bought this to go with my Super Champ X2 combo"}
{"source": "  It works"}
{"source": "  It also came with a cord"}
{"source": "I was not happy the Super Champ X2 didn't come with it"}
{"source": "  Both my Hot Rod Deluxe and Blues DeVille came with foot switches"}
{"source": "  And you really need the foot switch to use the X2's various voicings and effects"}
{"source": " Now the X2 is my main amp"}
{"source": "You need this to get the most out of your Super-Champ XD amp"}
{"source": " The only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic"}
{"source": " No telling how long the switches will last? Fender tends to make good products"}
{"source": " Price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp IMO"}
{"source": "I'm a guitar, piano and bass player, as well a private music teacher"}
{"source": "  I also received formal training in guitar-building and have been commissioned to build instruments for amateur and professional musicians"}
{"source": "I ordered this ukelele on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon, and I was pleased with this instrument when it arrived"}
{"source": "  I was really surprised at how loud this particular instrument is for its size"}
{"source": "  It's only about 19\" long (approximately) with nylon strings, but it really puts out a strong volume and really nice tone"}
{"source": "  It has geared tuners, not peg-style tuners that seem to go out of tune easily"}
{"source": "Although I've never played ukelele, I was able to play songs like Brown Eyed Girl, Old MacDonald Had a Farm, and Do You Wanna Dance in about a 1/2 hour using the chord book that comes with the book"}
{"source": "  I did this drawing on my guitar-playing knowledge"}
{"source": "Also, my daughter, who is a piano player and 11 years old,  picked up the ukelele"}
{"source": "  In about 15 minutes was able to play Row Row Row Your Boat, which is in the instruction booklet which comes with the uke"}
{"source": "  I see this as a good buy for beginners and a good starter instrument for young children who might like to move over to guitar eventually"}
{"source": "Two concerns though -- mine came with a couple small dents in the back of the ukelele -- nothing major, but I could see them -- looks like someone hit it on something"}
{"source": "  Also, most stringed instruments go out of tune for a short while after you put new strings on them"}
{"source": "  This one wouldn't stay in tune for more than one song when I started playing with it"}
{"source": "  I yanked on the strings to stretch them, kept retuning it and playing it, and it would still go out of tune"}
{"source": "  This is improving, and I'm trusting the reviews here that say it goes out of tune \"at first\""}
{"source": "  I'm expecting the tuning problem to disappear as the strings get stretched and the windings around the tuners tighten out any slack"}
{"source": "[note:  Two days later, after about 8 hours of playing the instrument is staying in tune better and better; I expect the problem to correct itself as the string get stretched]The little 5-page booklet has basic chords and songs--  Row Row Row Your Boat, Are You Sleeping, He's Got the Whole World in His Hands, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Amazing Grace, and When Irish Eyes are Smiling"}
{"source": "  There was also a blurb about a famous ukelele player who authored the pamphlet on how to play the Ukelele and is the founding member of Louisville Ukelele Association Unlimited (LUAU!)-- a ukelele band"}
{"source": "Overall, I'm happy with this ukelele, and fully expect the tuning problem to go away with use"}
{"source": "This was an impulse buy"}
{"source": "  After playing the guitar for many years I thought a ukulele would be a fun addition, and I was right"}
{"source": "  This one proved that you don't have to spend big bucks for a nice instrument"}
{"source": "  It has a great sound, appears to be good quality and well made, all for a very reasonable price"}
{"source": " At first it didn't seem to stay in tune for more than a day, I decided that it was likely due to new strings as it seemed to improve after a few months"}
{"source": "  If your a beginner and am looking for good quality without spending a lot, this is a nice instrument"}
{"source": "Great ukulele! Very light which is nice"}
{"source": " Intonation is spot on looks beautiful too"}
{"source": "A perfect soprano ukulele for a beginner or an experienced player looking for a nicelooking affordable ukulele!"}
{"source": "I play a few stringed instruments, and ukulele isn't one of them"}
{"source": " But after seeing so many great uke players lately- Jake Shimaukuro, Joe Brown- I had a hankering to try some ukulele playing myself"}
{"source": " I wanted a playable instrument, and I didn't feel like spending a lot of money"}
{"source": " I've tried $30-40 ukes in stores that were big disappointments- bad intonation, no tone, etc"}
{"source": " After reading reviews here and elsewhere I decided to risk a purchase"}
{"source": "Result? This is a surprisingly good instrument for less than fifty bucks"}
{"source": " Sure, it doesn't have the volume or the rich tone of a soprano with a solid top, but it delivers good tone, excellent intonation, and good playability at a very good price"}
{"source": " It may not be a 5-star intrument- but it's a 5-star value"}
{"source": "If you're thinking about trying ukulele, but you're not sure you want to buy an expensive instrument right away, I would strongly recommend an LU-21"}
{"source": " Even after you buy a better uke, this is a great one to keep on hand to shove into the hands of unsuspecting guests, so that you can play ukulele duets!"}
{"source": "There seems to be a trend in using a Ukulele in modern music these days"}
{"source": " A guitar player for 20 years now I decided to give it a try"}
{"source": " This was a low risk (cost) way for me to get my feet wet without committing"}
{"source": " It takes a little getting used to with such a small instrument, little neck and only 4 strings but it sure is a blast to play"}
{"source": " I wont be making an upgrade any time soon but the sound and build quality is reasonable for the price and for the few songs I use if for it will serve me fine"}
{"source": " Highly recommend"}
{"source": "I don't have experience with toy instruments, but have lots of experience with better quality ones including professional and semi professional ones"}
{"source": " I'm not a ukulele player, and this one is for my daughter, whose high school ukulele club features players with a variety of instruments for me to compare this one to"}
{"source": "I found this one to be made well enough that it plays well"}
{"source": " The frets are properly aligned, and the instrument stays in tune"}
{"source": " Notes played on alternate frets are in tune as well as I would expect relative to each other"}
{"source": " The tuning issues others have mentioned relative to break in periods are no different from what you would expect on violins or guitars, and are perfectly normal"}
{"source": "Although this plays well, I was disappointed with the workmanship"}
{"source": " Since I did not see similar comments from others, perhaps mine is not representative"}
{"source": " But the workmanship is somewhere closer to the level of lower quality instruments I've seen of other types"}
{"source": "The finishing quality is not out of line for the price range, but does not approach what other reviewers have led me to believe"}
{"source": " The wood is not properly finished where the neck meets the body, and there are clear sanding marks in the wrong direction"}
{"source": " It looks as if it had been finished in a hurry by somebody who had no intention of doing a quality job"}
{"source": "A less important issue has to do with the grain"}
{"source": " Normally, instrument makers will try to line up the grain with the direction of the body"}
{"source": " On mine, the grain is at a slant, giving the impression that the neck is slightly bent"}
{"source": " It's an optical illusion, but not a sign of higher quality instrument making"}
{"source": "The workmanship issues are cosmetic, and I'm still quite satisfied with the way the instrument plays"}
{"source": " The finishing issues will not be visible when being played, and the tonal quality is about what I'd expect from an instrument with such a small resonating chamber"}
{"source": " Perhaps there are better sounding soprano models out there, but at this price point it's what I expect"}
{"source": " If you are disappointed and want something better, expect to pay at least double"}
{"source": "I ordered this pedal for my casio keyboard and it works great"}
{"source": " It has a realistic feel to a piano and appears to be made of quality matterial"}
{"source": " this pedal works great and make my keyboard sound great"}
{"source": "I have used this pedal on both myRoland RD-300NX Digital Pianoand myRoland V-Combo VR-700and it's one hundred percent compatible with both"}
{"source": " One nice feature that ensures compatibility is the polarity switch that enables it to work with just about any brand and model keyboard"}
{"source": "It's well constructed and I have not encountered any issues with the two-piece bottom"}
{"source": " In fact, after over a year of use on carpet issues reported by another have not surfaced"}
{"source": " If anything this pedal is as good as new"}
{"source": "The feel is superb"}
{"source": " There is positive resistance as you depress the pedal and the spring tensions it in such a manner that you can control exactly the rate of depression or release"}
{"source": " It is not so tight as to fatigue, but the response is positive"}
{"source": "Another feature I love is the six foot cord length - it gives you room to place the pedal when you have tiered keyboards and multiple pedals on the floor"}
{"source": " The cable itself and the plug look to be high quality and have withstood over a year of constant use with no problems"}
{"source": "If you are looking for an inexpensive, but not cheaply made, pedal that will work with just about any keyboard this one is worth considering"}
{"source": " I am sold on it and would replace it with an identical pedal if something happens to this one"}
{"source": "I was a little concerned after reader some of the reviews here, but the warranty, Blue's reputation, and Amazon customer service convinced me to give it a try"}
{"source": " And in general, I'm pretty satisfied with it"}
{"source": " Using it with one of my Oktava MK-301 microphones I get excellent sound, no hum, and so far, excellent reliability"}
{"source": " I'm using it with Audacity and a few other programs, none of which have any difficulty recognizing it"}
{"source": " There were some issues setting it up initially, and I'm a bit leery about the plastic construction, but for what I paid I think it's a good value"}
{"source": " For those thinking of using it in field recording- stick it inside a carrying bag, and tape the cable to it to prevent stressing the USB connector"}
{"source": " You shouldn't have any problems"}
{"source": "I have little doubt that the Blue Icicle will get the job done with a Shure SM-58, or similar \"dynamic\" microphone"}
{"source": "  But its claim that it will convert any \"condenser\" mic, even one that normally requires XLR connection and phantom power, into a \"plug 'n play\" USB mic should not be taken at face value"}
{"source": "  I say this because I have an acquaintance with the original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic who had intermittent and marginal success when he tried such a conversion"}
{"source": "  In the long run, he would have been ahead (in terms of both the conversion and saving a few bucks) by purchasing the AT2020 USB mic"}
{"source": "  As it is, the Blue Icicle is probably the best such converter on the market (the comparably priced LightSnake cable will not convert condenser mics, despite what you may have read)"}
{"source": "  So, if necessary, give it a try--and more than one"}
{"source": "  But make sure there are return privileges"}
{"source": "I got this for one of my guitar students whose mom just wanted a cheap case for her acoustic guitar"}
{"source": "  Now, let's be clear - this is easily worth $16, but it is a very bare-bones gig bag"}
{"source": "  It will protect your instrument to a degree - it only has minimal padding - and is probably good enough for any beginner instrument"}
{"source": "  ONe of my students has one of those Esteban infomercial guitars, which is pretty low quality (but not terrible and not unplayable), and the gig bag for that instrument has no padding whatsoever"}
{"source": "I only give 3 stars because for a little more money it's possible to get something which I feel is noticably better"}
{"source": "  I have a Musician's Friend acoustic gig bag that I paid ~$20 for a few years ago, and it's well made and probably has twice the padding of this thing"}
{"source": "So, this isn't bad, it's worth the price, it's put together just fine, but it only just barely serves its purpose of protecting your instrument, and I'd never trust this with an instrument of any value"}
{"source": "  Gig bags can be a good alternative to a hard case if space or weight are a concern"}
{"source": "  This isnt' a bad choice, but just be aware of what you're getting"}
{"source": "I will just say that in my opinion, if you are looking for something to take your Taylor to a gig in, you are better served with an SKB"}
{"source": " In a sense, the case should mirror the guitar it will hold"}
{"source": " However, all that being said, this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars"}
{"source": " It is well crafted and cheap"}
{"source": " I use it for my Ibanez Exotic Acoustic Electric"}
{"source": " A nice guitar, but not one that i would cry about if it got a scratch or two"}
{"source": " Anyway, i also store some extra picks, my strap, and a couple cords in the bag (along with a fretboard cloth, a set of strings, a tuner, and an allen wrench for the truss rod)"}
{"source": " All in all, great value for a good item"}
{"source": "The case is very nice and sturdy"}
{"source": " It has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come"}
{"source": " The inside is very nice and soft with a big pocket to put things in it like picks, tuners, capos"}
{"source": " It also has a lock on the case in case one might need it"}
{"source": " This is a very good price for a case of this good of quality and I highly recommend it"}
{"source": "This is a great case that came TWO WEEKS earlier than the arrival date"}
{"source": " In came in good packaging and I found no flaws when inspecting it"}
{"source": " My Jasmine fits snugly inside of it, no bumping whenever I carry the case"}
{"source": " The only problem I have is it smells terrible! But that's fine; I just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable"}
{"source": " Other than that, this was a great investment!"}
{"source": "This is a great capo from shubb"}
{"source": " The finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel"}
{"source": " I like how it works"}
{"source": " It adjusts to fit different guitar necks, and just sort of snaps in place"}
{"source": " It doesn't require great force or a lot of hand strength to use this capo"}
{"source": " The rubber parts are replaceable and with a name like shubb you know you're getting a good product"}
{"source": " I recommend this capo to anyone"}
{"source": "Thought about buying the (expensive) G7th capo, but I'm very glad I didn't"}
{"source": "  The tried and true Shubb works great at a great price"}
{"source": "  I don't use it much but it's nice to know that when I do I won't have to mess around with or detune to make it sound right"}
{"source": "  The difference between this one and 'clamp on style' is night and day"}
{"source": "This is a great capo!  I had been using Kyser Quik-Change capos for a good portion of my ten years of playing but they had their limits"}
{"source": "  For one, intonation wasn't always right and my guitar (especially my electric) would go out of tune frequently"}
{"source": "  After trying others, I settled on the Shubb and it outguns the Kyser in every aspect"}
{"source": "  Its features surprised me"}
{"source": "  It is small and incredibly light weight, you almost can't tell that it's there"}
{"source": " The adjustable knob is great and allows you to dial the capo to the right pressure so that you don't get any annoying buzz"}
{"source": "  Also my tone has greatly improved (which is an awesome bonus) making my acoustic sound much clearer and much more defined as opposed to the Kyser which I noticed muddied up the sound"}
{"source": "  Even though you have to make some adjustments this capo is still easy to use and is one of the best investments I have ever made!"}
{"source": "This capo isn't quite wide enough for my regular steel string acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " If I position it just so it will work as long as I don't bump it or a string will pop out of one side"}
{"source": "This capo works very well!It applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design"}
{"source": "  The rubber seems to hold well - it's a bit thin and seems like it could wear over an extended period of time, but I've had no issues as of yet"}
{"source": "My guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capo's design"}
{"source": "  I also have a quick-change Keyser and I can say I prefer this one for practice sessions, but the Keyser for performing"}
{"source": "  This one is too slow for the stage"}
{"source": "Quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any Ernie Ball products,great, very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces, not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces"}
{"source": " I have them on several bass cabinets, they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use"}
{"source": "I chose this because I wanted an easier way to clean my guitar strings"}
{"source": " So far it has worked beautifully"}
{"source": "This is a very useful little device"}
{"source": " I use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar"}
{"source": " It removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately"}
{"source": " This will increase the life of your strings"}
{"source": " Don't expect miracles, but this helps quite a bit"}
{"source": " I have bought this for me and several guitar-playing friends that have found this much useful"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": " Cheers!"}
{"source": "This is great idea to clean guitar strings"}
{"source": " I've always wiped down the necks of my guitars but this allows you to clean the underside of the strings as well as the top"}
{"source": "Simple to use, small to fit inside a case or gig bag and not expensive"}
{"source": "Using this will help lengthen the life of your strings and pay for itself in no time"}
{"source": "I had neglected my guitar for awhile but just got back into the swing of things"}
{"source": " Needless to say the strings were at least 5 years old and I was about to replace them with new ones but thought I would give this a try"}
{"source": " I am amazed at how good the strings feel now"}
{"source": " They really are like a new set of strings"}
{"source": " Saved me 20 bucks in having it restrung too soon so they already paid for themselves"}
{"source": " My only reason for knocking off 1 star is because the darn thing is harder to open then it should be"}
{"source": " They could rethink the clasp a bit more but it does get the job done"}
{"source": "I was not to thrill about this product, I really don't have anything super negative to say but nothing super positive either,"}
{"source": "I'm on the fence with this product"}
{"source": " It does its job so no real complaints there, however once applied I feel it may be damaging my frets"}
{"source": " I havent seen wear or visible damage but as you run it up the neck of the guitar you hear it hit all the frets"}
{"source": " If you apply pressure to keep it from hitting it then pulls the top cleaning pad off, away from the strings causing it not to clean the top"}
{"source": " Much more convenient then using a string cleaning cloth though so I'm sticking with this"}
{"source": "Nifty little item that does what it's designed to do"}
{"source": "Realistically,it's not worth $10"}
{"source": "00"}
{"source": "$5"}
{"source": "00? yes"}
{"source": "Save your money"}
{"source": "I regret this purchase for what I paid for it"}
{"source": "Pretty cool gadget"}
{"source": " a whole lot less trouble than opening and closing bottles, cans, or sprays, and does on a set of old strings"}
{"source": "I bought this since I am a new guitar player"}
{"source": "It does hit the frets but doesn't seem to do any damage"}
{"source": "Pretty easy to use"}
{"source": "The only oddity I have is that the box was kind of open already when I bougt it new"}
{"source": "Does the job"}
{"source": "It sorta cleans strings but not fully, i dont even really use it anymore, i feel like i wasted my money on this item"}
{"source": "I've been playing guitar for over 30 years both teaching & performing and never used a pedalboard"}
{"source": " I used to carry the FX's in a briefcase and setup the ones I needed"}
{"source": " I'm old school when it comes to these boxes"}
{"source": " I run compression, wah, overdrive, super-overdrive, delay & reverb pretty much in that order"}
{"source": " Sometime I use a phaser or a tremolo"}
{"source": " I also have a few distortion pedals laying around as well but don't use them much"}
{"source": " I currently have 8 pedals setup on this board"}
{"source": " I have room for one maybe two more"}
{"source": " The board itself is built like a tank and travels well"}
{"source": " The bag that comes with it is road worthy for local gigs but I wouldn't take it on tour without a metal case"}
{"source": " I did go ahead and Velcro down all the pedals that I always use leaving a little room for add ins"}
{"source": " Be sure you want to Velcro down the FX chain because to get the best, most secure, it won't fall off the board when you pick it up off the floor"}
{"source": "I found that I had to remove all the rubber feet from each pedal"}
{"source": " The Velcro is very strong and may test the durability of some of your cheaper pedals"}
{"source": " Use great care when removing them from the board as you can easily rip the backs off of some of them"}
{"source": " Low end wah pedals and boxes made out of plastic be warned"}
{"source": "Boss, MXR, Mod Tone and other high end, well made pedals work best once set on the board"}
{"source": " You can run any number of power sources to it"}
{"source": " There is plenty of room for all my needed connections"}
{"source": "I leave the choice of that to you the reader"}
{"source": "At the end of the day it's easier for me to move my FX pedals around and setup on the gig is in minutes"}
{"source": " Plus it looks much cleaner and gives me a little more room on tiny stages and less chance of tripping over a cable"}
{"source": " I'm very happy with this product and would replace it should anything happen to it"}
{"source": "This pedal board replaced a bcb6 boss case because I have a lot of non-Boss pedals and wanted to start using them for gigs"}
{"source": "The PT2 footprint is large enough to accommodate a lot of pedals but not too big for a smaller gig, except some of the smallest \"stages\" (room corners) that do require a smaller rig"}
{"source": "Without going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case"}
{"source": "  I wrote the company, described the problem"}
{"source": "  Lizzie wrote back and said she'd take care of it"}
{"source": " You just don't get better service than this company provides"}
{"source": "  Combine that with the great product design and I'm a happy customer"}
{"source": "The larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath"}
{"source": "  This is one of its best features"}
{"source": "  Truly plug and play"}
{"source": "  Yes, I spent more than I ever have on a pedal board before"}
{"source": "  Portability"}
{"source": "  Reliability"}
{"source": "  Flexibility"}
{"source": "  If I was ever going to use my best pedals for gigs, this was it"}
{"source": "I have tried SKB and Furman and they have some nice features, if you like a lot of plastic"}
{"source": "  I still like the PT2 much better"}
{"source": "Once you place the pedals on it, it's kinda heavy"}
{"source": "but it won't hurt your back"}
{"source": " I arranged 11 pedals on the frame and they fit perfectly"}
{"source": "No brainer, built to last and the carrying case it's outstanding"}
{"source": "Cheers!!!!"}
{"source": "My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply"}
{"source": " I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus"}
{"source": "The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply"}
{"source": " However, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise"}
{"source": "First of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board"}
{"source": " The fitment to the power supply is there"}
{"source": " sort of"}
{"source": " There's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together"}
{"source": " I wasn't worried about this, since I doubt I'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet"}
{"source": "The second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter"}
{"source": " Once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out"}
{"source": " You'll probably have to break them"}
{"source": " It's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive"}
{"source": "The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this"}
{"source": " Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board"}
{"source": " You can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to"}
{"source": "I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, I wish I could return this board - except I can't, because it now has holes drilled in it"}
{"source": " (You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it"}
{"source": ")Basically, I paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro"}
{"source": " Needless to say, I'm not very pleased"}
{"source": "Tried several of pedaltrain in the past (pt-3 too bulky, and pt-jr a little to small), this one holds my pedals perfectly"}
{"source": " Simple & light"}
{"source": " I love it!"}
{"source": "I am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product"}
{"source": " I have been playing professionaly for more than 35 years and in that time have gone through many amps, guitars and and dozens of effects of all sorts"}
{"source": " The great ones I have kept over the years (Ibanez TS9 and TS 10, MXR Compressor etc"}
{"source": ") and have put them in a small pedal rack that doesn't take up much stage room"}
{"source": " The one item that I didn't have in a pedal form was a good reverb"}
{"source": " I have had great success with other Behringer rack products (Digital Reverb/echo, EQ's, patch panels and other home studio stuff)"}
{"source": " The DR600 was my first Behringer pedal"}
{"source": " I think it works great"}
{"source": " I have had it for about 6 months and have used it almost every weekend since I got it to play jobs with my band (often several nights a week)"}
{"source": " It has given me no problem"}
{"source": " I can't speak to the battery issue since my pedal board is powered by a \"One Spot\" multi AC adapter"}
{"source": "I ordered this pedal based on the previous 2 reviews, but to me it sounds very tinnie and cheap, plus the control knobs were a bit tight and hard to adjust"}
{"source": " I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price, but this one I won't be keeping"}
{"source": " To me, it wasn't even close to as good as the Fender amp reverbs"}
{"source": "Behringer usually makes good stuff and this Reverb Is No different but what It does best Is reverse reverb and moderate depth reverb Nothing else"}
{"source": " I wanted this for Singing and I have the Danelectro FAB Echo which gives a short distance echo but I wanted something without the slap back and this does what I want It for but Not quite as much depth as I wanted but with The Music I do Not think Anyone can tell"}
{"source": " If You want a good Reverb that Is above average with much depth then get the Behringer RV600 Not this"}
{"source": " The power supply I use Is Danelectro which Is great, I also have a godlyke that I use"}
{"source": "Yes, it's cheap plastic"}
{"source": "  Yes, the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours"}
{"source": "  Yes, the battery is difficult to replace"}
{"source": "  However, this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet"}
{"source": "  I solved the battery problem by using a 1-Spot 8-outlet pedal power supply"}
{"source": "  It doesn't sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest"}
{"source": "  Everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here, and it all sounds great"}
{"source": "  It even has a \"modulated\" reverb, which is a reverb with a slight flange/chorus affecting the reverb signal only (not the dry signal) which is their version of the Holy Grail's \"Flerb\" setting"}
{"source": "  This is about 1/3 the cost of the Holy Grail, and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use (unless of course, you are an elephant)"}
{"source": "  For all the complaining I hear about this and other pedals with \"cheap plastic cases\", I have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it"}
{"source": "  Behringer pedals are hit and miss, but this one is certainly a hit"}
{"source": "Bought two of these inexpensive adapters and am very satisfied"}
{"source": " I am not having any problems fastening to a stand or cam corder, and I am able to clamp the swivel lock very securely"}
{"source": " I am only using for light-weight applications"}
{"source": " Certainly worth the $7"}
{"source": "I usually use fender "}
{"source": "73 picks but they seemed to fall out of my fingers while I was playing and it was very irratating"}
{"source": " So I picked these up"}
{"source": " I no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand"}
{"source": " The star in the middle allows your fingers to connect in the star and you are able to get a good and stable grip on it"}
{"source": " Hands down the best pick I've used"}
{"source": "I guess I have tried about every type of pick around"}
{"source": " Thick ridged things with thin strumming edges, great big triangles oh do you remember cork circles on one side? Look this is just easy, the star hole means I grip it and it doesn't move until I let go"}
{"source": " Never had one break and the gauge being marked is so much nicer than digging through the \"pick pen\" on the counter of the local music store trying to find 3 that feel right"}
{"source": " Yup 3 'cause they were three for $1"}
{"source": "00"}
{"source": "Very good and very useful device"}
{"source": " Very solidly built and it does what it was designed to do, very very well"}
{"source": "Definitely holds the guitar well "}
{"source": " a little pricey but probably worth it"}
{"source": " I'm a fan of Dunlop in general but think they got it right with this one"}
{"source": "I was impressed by the sturdiness and size of this neck cradle"}
{"source": " Combined with the OP/TECH work mat that I purchased I can now turn almost any table or bench into a handy guitar workstation"}
{"source": " In my experience Jim Dunlop always makes good products and this one continues that tradition"}
{"source": "Moen pedals are great"}
{"source": "  Nice quality at an unbelievable price point"}
{"source": " This pedal is no exception"}
{"source": "  It is a great sounding vibe with the bonus of a nice chorus which can be engaged by the toggle switch"}
{"source": "  to be fair I have not tried many other vibes"}
{"source": "  Hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal"}
{"source": "  That being said I am absolutely pleased with the sound of this pedal and have had no need to look elswhere"}
{"source": "  vibe is very Trower like"}
{"source": " Think bridge of signs"}
{"source": "  Chorus is on the mellower side"}
{"source": " Very analog sounding not digital"}
{"source": "  Replaced my BBE mind bender and fits the bill so much better"}
{"source": "  Solid well built and should last"}
{"source": "  I would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues"}
{"source": "My only issue was that after a year or so the pedal seemed a bit less strong in its effect"}
{"source": "  I read online that a bit of electrical tape around the internal led's would fix the problem and indeed it did"}
{"source": "  It's been fine since"}
{"source": "  Despite this needed fix I would buy this pedal again with no hesitation if I needed to"}
{"source": "look this pedal doesnt cost a arm and leg, but as far as other vibes and chorus pedals this pedal falls short"}
{"source": " but I wasnt looking at sending alot so it gets the job done"}
{"source": "COMPARISONS: I have compared, side by side, the following pedals:Fulltone mini deja vibe ($200), Dunlop Univibe (discontinued stainless steel model)($220), Dunlop Roto-vibe ($180), Voodoo Labs Micro Vibe ($150), BBE Soul Bender ($129) as well as comparing to some \"different beasts\" in the modulation family - an MXR phase 90, MXR EVH flanger, Boss chorus, Behringer Vibrato, and Behringer Time Machine"}
{"source": "SUMMARY - just the factsA great pedal and my favorite uni-vibe of all"}
{"source": " Doesn't take a lot of space up, standard power supply, good visibility on control knob settings"}
{"source": " Does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise"}
{"source": " This is the only pedal in the univibe group I can say that about and it's why it's almost certainly going to be the one I keep"}
{"source": " Might have slightly less ability to produce as thick of a univibe effect as some of the others -- still need to play with it a little more"}
{"source": " Overall I LOVE this pedal at under 60 bucks"}
{"source": " Only downsides I see are the LED does not flash the speed rate, and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to \"toe tweak\" with my right foot"}
{"source": " Quality seems ok, but time will tell on durability"}
{"source": "PROS- Smallish form factor, although slightly larger than a \"boss\" pedal, doesn't take much more room than a standard pedal"}
{"source": "- Standard power supply (9v Center negative), and jack on top back for easy access - not in the way for patch cables on sides"}
{"source": "- Switchable between chorus(univibe) and vibrato"}
{"source": "- Controls spaced well for handling and use knobs with high visibility marking - easy to see"}
{"source": "- Best PRO is that it does not boost or cut volume and does not boost or cut bass, mids, or lows"}
{"source": " It just applies the uni-vibe type effect as dialed in and retains the character of the guitar tone"}
{"source": " This is the only pedal I tested that I can say that about -- and most of the others cost 2-4 times what this one cost"}
{"source": "- LED is red, visible and NOT a weird bright laser to my retina- The PRICE at about 60 bucks - is a great deal- Quality of construction -- metal case, decent knobs, pots and switches - no complaints so far"}
{"source": "CONS- LED does not flash speed rate- Speed control would be better placed Top right or bottom right for \"toe\" tweaking- I have just had this a day so can't tell but might be limited in getting the deepest most lush univibe sound - not sure about that and I will update this review as I get time to test further"}
{"source": " But it sounds great to me"}
{"source": "OVERALL - highly recommended if you want a univibe and don't want to do a lot of comparison shopping"}
{"source": " I have done it for you"}
{"source": " Some users report quality issues here -- I guess time will tell on that"}
{"source": " Mine works fine so far, and for $60 you could buy 2 and still save money over most other options available"}
{"source": "--------------------------------------NOTES ON ***OTHER*** PEDALS I COMPARED---------------------------------------- Fulltone Mini Deja vibe -- highest quality construction (as expected at $200)"}
{"source": " The large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking -- very useful on a vibe pedal"}
{"source": " My complaint is that this vibe colors my tone - it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass"}
{"source": " This probably helps the sound stand out in a mix, however, I'd rather that my vibe not provide EQ because when I switch it on or off, I don't want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back \"my sound\""}
{"source": " I was able to match exactly an authentic original Uni-vibe sound with some adjusting"}
{"source": " It seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also"}
{"source": " I have a love-hate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it"}
{"source": " Some days I hate it"}
{"source": "but I like the build quality and the speed control"}
{"source": " I originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didn't strip the treble off my tone -- until I realized the mids were boosted, the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked"}
{"source": " Mixed bag, and at $200 shouldn't be"}
{"source": "- MXR/Dunlop M68 (new in 2014)"}
{"source": " At about $140, The new M68 Uni-Vibe is a very good vibe pedal with much to like"}
{"source": " It is second place on my list"}
{"source": " On pure sound I might even like it slightly better than the Jimi, and that's saying something! It's the perfect form factor (shape/size) with no significant coloration of the tone, other than perhaps a tiny boost of treble in one mode"}
{"source": " The M68 gives the Jimi a good run"}
{"source": "and if you are extremely tight on board space, it might be a better choice for you"}
{"source": " They sound very similar"}
{"source": " The M68 has a wider range of adjustment on speed/depth than the Jimi, but I'm not sure the extra range is useful"}
{"source": " MXR/Jim Dunlop/MXR have GREAT factory customer service if you ever have an issue"}
{"source": " They fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty"}
{"source": " I really do wish MXR would move their power supply jack to the rear vertical surface instead of the right side vertical surface"}
{"source": " It is often in the way of right angle plugs on all my other MXR's"}
{"source": " Use of the small top left push button for switching from chorus to vibe on this pedal was the main negative issue as I'd have to leave it with the mini switch engaged, and the red LED burning all the time, looking like it is on when I was not actually engaging the circuit with the main switch"}
{"source": " It was also a tight fit"}
{"source": " This pedal has a level knob which I'm usually a fan of but I don't see the need for it on this effect"}
{"source": " I didn't care for the white \"main\" LED much, and of course the power supply location"}
{"source": " The LED on this does pulse the speed, but was annoying due to the white LED"}
{"source": " That's a subjective thing I suppose"}
{"source": " All said this is a great sounding option with that perfect MXR size, so a good choice"}
{"source": " But still 2X the cost of the Jimi"}
{"source": " I stuck with the Jimi on form, function, sound, and value"}
{"source": "- Dunlop Uni-vibe UV1 -- Cool stainless steel construction"}
{"source": " Knobs were hard to see settings"}
{"source": " placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best"}
{"source": " Non standard 18V power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick"}
{"source": " Sound was very good but did also color my EQ sound by boosting the bass, and muffling the mids and highs slightly"}
{"source": " On the one hand, this sound matched a lot of recorded uni-vibe sounds I've heard"}
{"source": " On the other hand, once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix"}
{"source": " The seller had a 3 day return policy (3 days??!!) so I returned it and they lost the sale"}
{"source": " Othewise, I would still be thinking about this one"}
{"source": " I was on the fence about whether it was my winner"}
{"source": " I was able to match a true uni-vibe sample, but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me"}
{"source": " At $220 I'd have to love it to keep it"}
{"source": "- Voodoo Labs Micro Vibe - Liked the form factor, the simple controls, high visibility knobs, ability to toe tweak controls, standard 9V power supply, and placement of all jacks"}
{"source": " Can get a very lush, even excessive univibe sound except the bass is very boosted, and mids/highs are cut"}
{"source": " The EQ effect just kills the pedal for me"}
{"source": " Its going back"}
{"source": " Not my pick at $150"}
{"source": "- BBE Soul Bender - My least favorite Vibe"}
{"source": " It had extreme muffling of mids and highs, heavy boost of bass"}
{"source": " In a band mix, I'm pretty sure it would get totally lost"}
{"source": " At home, might sound ok"}
{"source": " form factor was good, controls were simple, I think it pulsed the speed"}
{"source": " My recollection is it had an overly bright blue LED"}
{"source": " It was the first vibe I bought, and I only compared to Fulltone and Dunlop before returning it"}
{"source": " Had some useable sounds, but with the intensity above 50% had an annoying \"womp womp womp\" of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar -- a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion"}
{"source": " With intensity below 50% it was usable"}
{"source": "kind of"}
{"source": " But a tone muffler"}
{"source": " I returned this one early"}
{"source": "- Dunlop ROTO-Vibe : A good choice (perhaps the only choice) if you MUST have expression pedal controlled speed adjustment"}
{"source": " Didn't color the tone much - and that was a problem on most other uni-vibes tested"}
{"source": " Limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me"}
{"source": " Intensity range seemed less than other pedals too"}
{"source": " Large footprint if mounted on board, but also offers the ability to take NO space on the board by not mounting it"}
{"source": " I didn't like that when you switch the effect on, you are automatically at high speed due to the mechanical nature of the design"}
{"source": " Some awkwardness in the placement of controls and power plug vs guitar cables when plugged in"}
{"source": " Std power supply a plus"}
{"source": " LED indicators good and flash the speed"}
{"source": " Durable construction although the mechanical nature means in time something will need lubricating and you may need to replace internal gears or pots"}
{"source": " Overpriced 1"}
{"source": "5 to 2X in my opinion"}
{"source": "- Other general modulation effects"}
{"source": " Univibes are effectively a phase effect - without the swooshy space-age edge on the sound"}
{"source": " You can probably modify a modern phaser pedal to get the univibe sound which is like a vibrato plus analog chorus combined"}
{"source": " A modern phaser is close, a modern flanger is much too space-age sounding"}
{"source": " Vibrato pedals can capture the vibrato aspect of a uni-vibe and I'd recommend the behringer vibrato at $25 if you like vibrato sounds"}
{"source": " uni-vibes are normally used for their \"chorus\" setting, not the vibrato setting"}
{"source": " Didn't care for the Behringer time machine"}

{"source": "A NOTE ON VENDOR SELECTIONI had a very bad experience with the vendor I bought my MXR/Dunlop M68 from, and while it does not weigh at all on my review of that product, I provided a separate star rating on the vendor feedback page"}
{"source": " I recommend if you choose to purchase that pedal (or anything else) you be careful to avoid the Amazon Marketplace vendor called MixDSPnet in San Jose, CA"}
{"source": " In addition to charging a 15% restocking fee if you want to return the pedal (in original condition with all materials and packaging), getting them to even acknowledge the return request at all was a problem and took over a week and finally opening a claim with Amazon to get any meaningful response"}
{"source": " Once they did communicate, they were very unprofessional"}
{"source": " Further, when the product was shipped back signature required (as recommended by amazon), they were \"not available\" or refused to sign for it so after several weeks of attempting to return the product, it remains **unrefunded** despite their confirmation that I could return the item for an 85% refund"}
{"source": " I expect I'll need to work further with Amazon in the end to get this resolved"}
{"source": " A google earth view of their addressed explained it all"}
{"source": " MixDSPnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex"}
{"source": " Most Amazon marketplace sellers are just fine but this one is really not, at least when it comes to returns"}
{"source": " Also, while they sell a few Dunlop/MXR guitar pedals, looking at their site reveals it's not their primary business - they seem to sell a bunch of other non-musical widgets"}
{"source": " My recommendation is that you find a vendor who is in the musical instrument business and who will provide the typical no cost refunds for 30 to 45 days as most large musical instrument retailers do, should you need it"}
{"source": " They have a few hundred positive transactions, so maybe can be OK but I can only comment on my experience and this was the worst online transaction I've ever had shopping on amazon"}
{"source": "Rugged pedal by a little known company"}
{"source": " Took a shot in the dark, hit a bullseye! Great univibeish/old chorus device"}
{"source": " Would like to see stereo output options in future models"}
{"source": " Solid"}
{"source": " If you have a Strat, have studied Jimi, then it will suit you well if you've got the right physical approach to the guitar itself"}

{"source": "decent, holds 2 stands and maybe a few extra poles"}
{"source": "  the bag's shape from side view is a rectangle -- compare to other stand bags that's more of a square"}
{"source": " Zipper seems to be very good quality, the bag is NOT padded at all, and the material used is very thin, there is however a water resistant coating on the interior of the bag"}
{"source": "I think I should have spend $10 extra and got the on-stage padded stand bag"}

{"source": " The side pocket is good for incidentals like XLR to 1/4 inch adapters, patch cables and the like"}
{"source": "Bottom line: this case is for occasional use only, and even then for lighter stands"}
{"source": " I awarded it five stars because it does exactly what I need and is not touted to be anything but a light weight case"}
{"source": "Just needed a simple canvas bag to hold speaker stands on top of my pile of PA equipment on a cart"}
{"source": " Aside from the two speaker stands, I can fit two mic stands and the bottom of a music stand"}
{"source": " Very simple, sturdy canvas construction, thick zipper, two sturdy handles"}
{"source": " I don't expect to carry equipment around in it much more than to get on and off my cart, so I'm assuming the stitching is more than sufficient"}
{"source": " At $20, this bag looks like a great value"}

{"source": " The Marshall has a ton of tweaks that are hard to get exactly right"}
{"source": "The volume level on the different voices is nowhere near matched"}
{"source": " Some voices are incredibly loud, others are really quiet"}
{"source": " Switching voices means moving that volume knob a lot"}
{"source": " Sadly, the volume only goes to 10"}
{"source": "Once the voice is selected, there are 5 effects settings possible with two or three level for each (Vibratone, Delay, Reverb, Chorus, and Tremolo)"}
{"source": " The F/X level knob adjusts the amount of the effect applied (set to 1, the effect isn't used at all)"}
{"source": " This is probably the least useful part of the amp"}
{"source": " There is no pedal selection, so once the effect is selected and volume dialed in, you're kind of stuck with that until you fiddle with the amp again"}
{"source": " There's no easy way to change the effect in the middle of a song"}
{"source": "There is a gain knob"}
{"source": "I like the speaker on this amp"}
{"source": " It is nicely detailed with a good warm sound"}
{"source": " The internal speaker is connected with a 1/4 inch jack, so it is possible to connect the amp up to another cabinet with a simple 1/4 inch speaker cable"}
{"source": " Very nicely done Fender, most cheaper amps are hard wired to the speaker"}
{"source": " The back panel also has a 1/4 inch jack Line Out"}
{"source": "This is a great small gig or practice amp"}
{"source": " The sound is outstanding"}
{"source": " The amp is used with a 1983 Gibson Lucille and a 2008 Les Paul Standard Plus"}
{"source": "Small"}
{"source": " Light weight"}
{"source": " Stunning Fender Blackface looks"}
{"source": " Warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive"}
{"source": " The digital voicing is direct and easy to set up"}
{"source": " The fact that Fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me"}
{"source": " It is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio"}
{"source": " The direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recorder/mixer and still give you the amp's skeaker as a monitor for yourself"}
{"source": " What could be easier? And it mikes well too, by the way"}
{"source": " The choice is yours there"}
{"source": "With no LED display (cost increase if one was there) and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive, it's so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun, and practicle too"}
{"source": " The voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates"}
{"source": " The Tweed, Blackface, and Marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little amp"}
{"source": "Love the reverb in the FX section"}
{"source": " The spring reverb is so well done that I bumped the amp once and was looking for the \"spring chrash\" known from amps with the real spring reverb"}
{"source": " It's that good"}
{"source": " Once again, the controls are easy and direct"}
{"source": " Never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort"}
{"source": " Who cares if it doen't have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection? You want that, go waste your money on a Line 6 or something"}
{"source": " This Champ is made for one thing"}
{"source": " To give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort"}
{"source": " I believe it has accomplished that well"}
{"source": "Again, a shame that Fender has dropped this model from the line up of products"}
{"source": " The super model is a step up in power and speaker size, but also the cost is higher as well"}
{"source": " I'm just glad that I got one of these from Amazon"}
{"source": " com when I did and will not part with the amp"}
{"source": " Been playing for five decades now and I know when I have a good instrument or gear and when I don't"}
{"source": " This model is a keeper to be sure"}
{"source": " And I don't even like digital! How's that for an endorsement? It's that good for what it does"}
{"source": "My Instant Order Update notice shows that I purchased this in December 3, 2010, and during the time I've owned this cable it has been heavily used and is still noise-free and perfect in all respects"}
{"source": "  For context I purchased it to connect a mic tube pre-amp to a mixer, so it has been set up and torn down many times in the past two and a half years"}
{"source": "Key points that earn the five stars is the heavy duty strain reliefs, which keep the inside conductors from bending and stressing"}
{"source": " I am guessing those are why this patch continues to be noise free and provide a strong signal"}
{"source": "  Also, the XLR connectors are of the highest quality"}
{"source": " In the past I have cut corners only to find that small details like connectors do not always mate well"}
{"source": " Not so with these"}
{"source": " They engage and disengage without binding or looseness"}
{"source": " Bear in mind that they have been in frequent use - inserted and removed hundreds of times"}
{"source": "The outer jacket is fairly thick, which to me is an indication that the manufacturer did not cut corners when this cable was constructed"}
{"source": "Overall I am pleased because this patch has withstood a lot of use and has held up perfectly"}
{"source": " I would not hesitate to purchase more of this brand and model if I need additional ones"}
{"source": "This is a great xlr cable and does the job for what I need it to, which is attach my dslr shoe to an external shotgun mic"}
{"source": "  It has low noise, clean sound/good transmission"}
{"source": "  The only issue is that this particular cable, more-so than any of my other ones, is hard to get a locking click on anything it attaches to on either end"}
{"source": "  Once it's attached it's fine, but then it's the same coming off, I have to pull much harder than with my other cables and it makes me worried I'll damage a microphone"}
{"source": "  With expensive equipment, I'd use a different cable as the tight grip on both the male and female sides worries me"}
{"source": "I bought this guitar nearly a year ago"}
{"source": " It was my first guitar"}
{"source": " I never cared much for the sound"}
{"source": " It always sounded out of tune, even when it was in tune"}
{"source": " I eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this Squier"}
{"source": " My skills are slowly improving but I wanted another electric so I sprang for a Epiphone Les Paul"}
{"source": " Yes, it's 3x more expensive than the Squier BulletStrat - but it sounds 10x better"}
{"source": "If you buy a Squier, I think you need to be prepared to make this a \"project\" guitar"}
{"source": " You'll probably want to replace the tuners, pickups, bridge, etc"}
{"source": "Or just buy a better guitar to begin with"}
{"source": " At this price point you probably won't find much better but you probably want to spend a little more for a much better guitar"}
{"source": "Had it for about two weeks and I'm about to return it now"}
{"source": "Things that I like(d):1"}
{"source": " It's a classic Fender and I was looking for something of good quality with great price"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " Sounds clear and crystal good, unplugged"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " This can be subjective but I think this BulletStrat is more comfortable than a Les Paul simply because it's wider and thinner"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " All the previous four ratings here on Amazon and even higher ratings on Musician's friend"}
{"source": "Things I don't like much:1"}
{"source": " 15th fret of lower E string is dead, and like always I take quality control into my rating account"}
{"source": "(I don't want to bother go to a local shop for a fix, never mention that's $20 in addition)2"}
{"source": " I couldn't figure out why the tune nob never changed the sound (like not a bit)? (I'm new to electric but my Les Paul does change tunes"}
{"source": " in a much much more obvious way)3"}
{"source": " Talking about plugged sound, it's no where close to unplugged"}
{"source": " Notes are pretty mixed up and not separated/clear, very loud though"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " I don't know if it's universal, I ordered new and get it with dirty plastic cover with scratches"}
{"source": " What's worse is, they place this nasty cover in between of the panel and the components upon it which makes it impossible to remove"}
{"source": " (I', not even sure if I can call it a protective cover because it's pretty weak and thin"}
{"source": ")This is overall an OK guitar, consider its price it can be made at least slightly better"}
{"source": " For beginners on budget with less than $200, I would recommend go for the better ones with a little more price"}
{"source": " For example, me, I got a SX Deimos ($175) Les Paul which I'm in love with now"}
{"source": " Simply everything about it is better, and I finally get the feelings of an electric"}
{"source": " I'm glad I don't need to stuck with this anymore"}
{"source": "According to Amazon,3 Stars - It's OK4 Stars - I like it5 Stars - I love it3 Stars Checked, it really IS just an OKAY guitar to me"}
{"source": "Thanks for reading, and hope people find their beloved guitars!"}
{"source": "My first Elec Guitar, I'm 60 years old, and this Guitar is PERFECT"}
{"source": "If theirs better ones out there, then I can't wait to get one"}
{"source": "I've got this one on a small 15 watt Amp, that's not a name brandAmp, and it sounds very good"}
{"source": "So, needless to say I'm verrrrrrry happy, and love the blues and Jazz sounds I'm getting"}
{"source": "B T W "}
{"source": "Who said learning the guitar was difficult"}
{"source": "Piece of Cake, if u practice"}
{"source": "Buy this Guitar, u won't be sorry you did"}
{"source": "EnjoyJawbone"}
{"source": "The Squier Bullet that I have is actually the model without the tremolo, however, everything else is just about the same as the model you see above"}
{"source": " It's a nice guitar for the money"}
{"source": " Nice size, action, and finish"}
{"source": " It's not a high-end guitar so don't expect it to sound like one, but for a beginner, it's pretty sweet"}
{"source": " I bought a more expensive blues guitar and had planned on trading this one in or selling it, however, I like it so much, that I plan on keeping it as a back up"}
{"source": " Parts are pretty easy to come by (with slight modifications, but that's to be expected) and fairly cheap too"}
{"source": "Great for a beginner electric"}
{"source": "Needed new strings but everything else was smooth"}
{"source": "Pick up a set of slinky strings and all is well"}
{"source": "Ok for the price"}
{"source": "  Tuners old style not sealed"}
{"source": "  PUP plate mal-adjusted and off quite a bit"}
{"source": "  I'd suggest adding locking tuners or at least modern day versions"}
{"source": "On the positive, action and intonation good"}
{"source": "  Better than expected"}
{"source": "  Much better than most Chinese guitars at the same price level"}
{"source": "  However, I've purchased others that have higher quality hardware for the same or less"}
{"source": "  That said, you'll probably do OK"}
{"source": "Epiphone setup and overall quality better than the Squier"}
{"source": "Many years ago I had a Fender Stratocaster and I had to get rid of it, so now I have the closest that I will ever get to that guitar again"}
{"source": " This one sounds great and looks good, and the price is great as well"}
{"source": "I initially wanted a Yamaha Pacifica 012DLX - Guitar Center in Eugene claimed to have stock in website - but when I reached there - there wasn't any"}
{"source": " So I tested an Affinity and a Bullet HSS instead - and thought the Bullet was pretty ok - but they did not have the color I wanted"}
{"source": " So I ordered through Amazon - but I bought a microcube from Guitar Center as I'm greatful for the opportunity to test guitars"}
{"source": "I waited for 2 weeks before I make this review so that it would be accurate and not based on initial impression"}
{"source": "I received the guitar in perfect condition - it came in a brown box shipping with no pictures or nice colors"}
{"source": " Just a few words SQUIER by Fender"}
{"source": " New strings and scratch free"}
{"source": " Made in China it says"}
{"source": " However - it did not have sharp frets like I experience with some 100 bucks guitarsThe action came very high and I had intended to return it - but the guitar was perfect and I couldn't find any fault to return"}
{"source": " So I proceed to setup the guitar through 3 long and painful steps: 1)Straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod"}
{"source": " 2)Then measured the string action height and set it from 1"}
{"source": "5mm for the first 3 strings and 2mm for the last 3 strings"}
{"source": " 3)Setup the intonation using a tuner"}
{"source": " You really need a tuner for this step"}
{"source": "After that, the guitar was splendid"}
{"source": " It did go out of tune in 2 or 3 days but stabilized after that"}
{"source": " I do not use the trem bar for fear of losing the tuning"}
{"source": "After 2 weeks, I'm still loving the guitar"}
{"source": " Beginners be warned - you may like the action or may need to do setup like I did"}
{"source": " In fact I'm so impressed with Squier that I'm thinking of getting the Squier Standard Strat next - pretty curious of the Alnico pups"}
{"source": "Latest review:Downgraded from 5 to 3 stars"}
{"source": "I bought a Washburn RX40 with Duncan USM"}
{"source": "The bullet is nice but I outgrew it"}
{"source": "The tuners are hard to tune as they are not sensitive"}
{"source": "The bullet has little sustain unless you want to experiment with it by changing strings, Tusq nut, locking the trem down"}
{"source": " etc"}
{"source": "I'd recommend to save some money and buy something above $200"}
{"source": " Guitars at that price may be twice the cost,"}
{"source": " but is more than twice better"}
{"source": "The 2 important things are not in Bullet: the sustain and the sound"}
{"source": "Latest review:The product is back at 5 stars!I got the sustain to improve by increasing the action"}
{"source": "Fret buzz causes the the sustain to be cut short"}
{"source": "There some sounds that a Strat can do that humbuckers type guitar fall short"}
{"source": "like attack finger plucking"}
{"source": "These cables work perfect for connecting my mixer to my amp"}
{"source": "  Not too long, not too short"}
{"source": "  Just what I needed"}
{"source": "What makes a good cable?  One that works"}
{"source": "  I've had these XLR cables fail because the pins get loose, so I hope this doesn't happen to this one"}
{"source": "I needed a cable to go from my mic to the floor, just to plug in a delay effect (our PA doesn't have an effects loop)"}
{"source": "This is just what the doctor ordered"}
{"source": "I just toss it in my gig bag with my vocal effects pedal and run the regular XLR from the pedal to the PA and I'm in business"}
{"source": "["}
{"source": "]"}
{"source": "Not much to say about a XLR cable"}
{"source": "It works"}
{"source": "Average quality"}
{"source": "does the job"}
{"source": " No problems"}
{"source": " Good price, came quickly through PRIME"}
{"source": "It's working ok, not for hard useI just use it on my PC table for karaoke online"}
{"source": "with phantom mic it's well done"}
{"source": "I originally bought several of these cables to use between our DMX light fixtures"}
{"source": " The day they arrived I happened to need a six foot cord on my live mic stand so I tried one of these"}
{"source": " The cable is soft and flexible and I could not tell any difference in sound from the custom cable I had been using (that's a good thing, my other cable was very expensive)"}
{"source": "The connectors are not gold plated but it's an inexpensive cable, it's not pretending to be anything other than a decent low-cost XLR two-conductor shielded cable"}
{"source": " It's working for me, I'll be buying more for our studio"}
{"source": "Often, we get what we pay for"}
{"source": " After researching various pieces of sound equipment for weeks and weeks, I chose solid items for reasonable prices"}
{"source": "I should've known better to skimp on what is a critical piece of the puzzle - the quality of the cable"}
{"source": " This item simply didn't ever work - it arrived with a bent pen on one end, and even when we attempted to straighten it, it didn't connect well onto the mixer board"}
{"source": " The microphone end was a VERY shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic"}
{"source": "Don't buy this item - spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand"}
{"source": "I tried this at the store"}
{"source": "  It looks like it would protect a guitar, but the latches are kind of large and clumsy"}
{"source": "  The interior was nothing special either"}
{"source": "  I passed"}
{"source": "I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars, a Fender American Standard Strat and a Fender American Standard Telecaster"}
{"source": " One was in the SKB Fender case ($99"}
{"source": "95 on Amazon), the other in a Gator case purchased locally"}
{"source": "  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case"}
{"source": " Both ended up in checked luggage"}
{"source": "  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section of the Gator case gave up"}
{"source": "  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case"}
{"source": "  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but with the padding loose, the Gator case is going to require some repair before it can be used again"}
{"source": " Other than a couple of scuff marks on the SKB Fender case, it's as good as new"}
{"source": "  I just ordered another SKB Fender case"}
{"source": "  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips with cheaper guitars"}
{"source": "  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on"}

{"source": "This arm fit my Mexican Strat perfectly"}
{"source": "  I then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price"}
{"source": "  I firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return"}
{"source": "  The only problems is that I'm not sure I can afford to pay the capital gains tax for all the profit that I made on my guitar investment"}
{"source": "  I might have to sell one of my Lexuses"}
{"source": " Lexi"}
{"source": " what the hell is the plural of Lexus?"}
{"source": "Background:I'm a gear-head, with an affection for pedals and always looking for amps that take them well"}
{"source": "  Before my current set-up, I played a Fender Strat run through my effects into a Vox AC15"}
{"source": "  The Vox sounded great but I had two problems: 1 - The all tube amp made me worry that my amp could crap out in the middle of a gig"}
{"source": " 2 - At 15 watts, even though it was loud, I'd often have to crank my amp to keep up with the rest of the band, and as the tube amp increased, so did it's natural gain"}
{"source": "  That would normally be sweet, but it would color my effects with a different tone, and often times leave me having feedback issues"}
{"source": "Enter the Fender Frontman 212R!This thing has TONS of clean headroom, and it seems like it was built for pedals"}
{"source": "  I can crank the amp or keep it quiet, and there is no tone changes done to my effects"}
{"source": "  This is a benefit of a solid state amp with high wattage and lots of clean headroom"}
{"source": "  It makes it easy to dial in your sound every time, no matter what volume you play at"}
{"source": "Secondly, it's Fender reliable (with a 5 year warranty)"}
{"source": "  No tubes means no tube issues"}
{"source": "  Yes, it doesn't sound as good as the Vox by itself, but that's why I have pedals"}
{"source": "Other things worth mentioning:It's not as heavy as my Vox (all tube) amp"}
{"source": "  I can carry this in with one hand and my guitar case with another"}
{"source": "It's got 2x12inch speakers"}
{"source": "  They push some serious sound, and they have some low punch too"}
{"source": "  My Vox had a better speaker, but the 12 inch by itself would often get stressed at high volumes"}
{"source": "  This amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down!My Vox may be a better recording amp, but this is a better gigging amp every day of the year"}
{"source": "I had two of these and wound up selling one because I never used it"}
{"source": " The one I kept is currently serving as a keyboard amp for two keyboards (simultaneously): aRoland RD-300NX Digital Stage Pianoand aRoland V-combo 76 Key Stage Keyboard"}
{"source": " I was able to do this because there are two inputs on the front of the amp"}
{"source": " Input 1 is designed for normal sensitivity and Input 2 is designed for guitars with active pickups"}
{"source": " Thus far I have had no problems with both boards connected at the same time, and it does not seem to matter which board is connected to which input"}
{"source": "The sound is impressive"}
{"source": " Exceptionally clean, and the amp provides controls to allow you to contour your sound, which helps significantly when running keyboards through it"}
{"source": "  Moreover, the amp is loud if you choose to make it so, and even at high-gain settings it has ample headroom"}
{"source": "If you want distortion, this is probably not the amp for you"}
{"source": " You can switch it from clean to drive to more drive, but it is essentially still a clean sounding amp"}
{"source": " I find this to be a plus, but I have met my share of guitarists who think otherwise"}
{"source": "Another great feature is you can daisychain these amps using the Pre-Out on the master to the Pwr-In on the aux amp(s)"}
{"source": " You can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop"}
{"source": " I personally have no use for those features, but I can see how they could be useful"}
{"source": "Overall, I love the amp and wish Fender made a single 12\" model because it is pretty heavy and bulky"}
{"source": " Those are hardly significant complaints since I sometimes regret selling my second one because if something happens to the one I still have I would replace it immediately"}
{"source": "First I bought a FM212DSP on the recommendation of a sales guy in a store"}
{"source": " That was my mistake"}
{"source": " I was looking for that \"Clean Fender Sound\" without paying the big bucks"}
{"source": "Well, here it is friends, in all it's glory"}
{"source": " Tons of headroom, so clean it can squeak if you want"}
{"source": " Tele players should fall all over this thing as a practice amp"}
{"source": "  Young players who are not heavy metal will absolutely love this for the price"}
{"source": " It's LOUD, it's clean, and there is a fair amount of distortion in it, although you have to coax the distortion out of it"}
{"source": "  Add a Danelectro Distortion pedal of some sort off Amazon for distortion and you're home"}
{"source": " I own nine amps, including Fender, Crate, and Peavey tube models, and this is cleaner"}
{"source": " If you play C&W;, look no further"}
{"source": " If you fingerpick, this is your amp"}
{"source": " Electrified banjo, mandolin or violin?  This is the amp!But, if you follow the darker side, keep looking"}

{"source": "  Reverb sounds great as well"}
{"source": "  A little overdrive sounds good too unless you use too much, gets quite noisy and loses its clarity"}

{"source": "  If high gain is what your after, then stay away"}
{"source": "  If you are into ANY other kind of music, then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price"}
{"source": "  Also, unless your playing with a drumset, this amp is overkill as far as volume goes"}
{"source": "  100 watts is not at all necessary for the bedroom guitarist"}
{"source": " If you are into ANY other kind of music, then this amp is fantastic and quite good for the price"}
{"source": "  All in all this amp was a good buy and I recommend it to anyone in the market for a solid state amp in this price range"}
{"source": "But this wouldn't be a very good review without having some cons"}
{"source": "  So here are mine"}
{"source": "  These are by no means deal breakers but I find them quite annoying"}
{"source": "POWER SWITCH IS ON THE BACK?-I find it annoying to have to reach around the back of the amp and feel for the power switch every time I turn it on"}
{"source": "  It is especially annoying if you are like me and have limited space and stack your amps on top of each other"}
{"source": "  With another amp sitting on top of my Frontman 212r, the power switch is even harder to get to"}
{"source": "EFFECTS LOOP IS ON THE FRONT?-The last thing I want to see on or around my rig is messy wires everywhere"}
{"source": "  When using the effects loop, one has to deal with looking at two more wires hanging down over the front of your amp when they could be hidden in the back"}
{"source": "  Not the end of the world but I just don't understand why"}
{"source": "  Why Fender why?FOOT-SWITCH JACK IS ON THE FRONT?-This one is not so bad, but just adds more messy wires to the picture"}
{"source": "REVERB IS NOT FOOT-SWITCHABLE"}
{"source": "-Foot-switch includes \"Channel\" and \"Boost\" buttons"}
{"source": "  A third button for \"Reverb\" would have been AMAZING"}
{"source": "CAB IS MADE OF SUPER CHEAP PARTICLE BOARD"}
{"source": "-Not that I expected anything different in this price range, but the \"wood\" used is so soft, that you CANNOT pick it up by the back"}
{"source": "  I could easily break a piece off with my bare hand if I wanted to, no exaggeration"}
{"source": "  I know because when I first got this amp I went to pick it up and I immediately stopped myself because I could feel it about to break"}
{"source": "---BOTTOM LINE---BUY if"}
{"source": "-This is the best amp you can afford-This matches the sound your after-You need the 100 Watts to be loud enough for a drumset-You want the Fender name and sound without the huge price-tag"}
{"source": "DONT BUY if"}
{"source": "-You play metal/hard rock-This is your first amp-You only plan on playing at bedroom levels-You can afford a tube amp"}
{"source": "I was doing research on a new guitar rig and I kept seeing this amp mentioned"}
{"source": " Almost all of the reviews I read were positive"}
{"source": " I decided to order it for a home practice amp when I don't want to dig out my main rig"}
{"source": "The build quality is solid - it feels like a much more expensive amp"}
{"source": " Many amps in this price range seem cheap and poorly constructed"}
{"source": " I was really impressed with the packaging, the documentation and the build of the amp"}
{"source": " This is my first Fender amp and probably not my last"}
{"source": "The sound quality is amazing"}
{"source": " Being a heavier rock/metal player, I would never have chosen a Fender amp even for home practice"}
{"source": " The first channel has a wonderful clean tone and the second channel has several modeled amps"}
{"source": " The tone ranges from clean to jazz to high gain"}
{"source": " There is even an acoustic model, and it sounds pretty good too"}
{"source": " There are a ton of Youtube videos of people demoing the sounds of this amp so I won't go much further into this"}
{"source": "The included effects are simple but pretty cool as well, and can be switched on and off via the optional foot switch"}
{"source": "Overall I'd say that this is a great amp for the price, and like many others, I highly recommend it"}
{"source": "That's not to brag but to illustrate my experience with AMPS"}
{"source": " Everything you can imagine"}
{"source": " This AMP ranks up there with the best of them"}
{"source": " I'm surprised as I've hated (with a passion) every DSP solid state amp I've ever played"}
{"source": " This hybrid is incredible"}
{"source": " The effects are excellent"}
{"source": " The built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording"}
{"source": " It has many onboard effects but I have racks and pedals that outdo those, so I don't use them for recording"}
{"source": "It's not a band amp unless you're an acoustic band or your drummer has electronic drums"}
{"source": " It's 15 Watts, but it's loud"}
{"source": " it's just not quite loud enough to get those cleans over the drums, though you might be fine for overdrive -- depending on the venue and situation"}
{"source": "It's not going to emulate certain amps like a VOX very well, but it does excellent with a Fender Black face (excluding the tube reverb)"}
{"source": " It does a Bassman ok, but doesn't quite capture that chime and nuisances tone of the original '59 Bassman"}
{"source": " Doesn't cost $11,000 dollars other"}
{"source": " It does a Marshall pretty well"}
{"source": " Marshall's based on '59 Bassman without the delicate touch, so there's no wonder"}
{"source": " The acoustic gives a very clean sound and makes that clean sound more full, yet doesn't sound like a filter"}
{"source": " 0, 6, 7, 9 and 12 are amazing voices"}
{"source": " You can bypass that and use  it without effects or voicing and it sounds a lot like the original Super Champ"}
{"source": "I also have a 2x12 Vintage 30 box I connect it to for even more of a wonderful fully dynamic and full rich sound"}
{"source": " When I'm just playing around the house or need a quick recording and don't wanna have to dial in sounds with my Vox AC30 or Fender Deluxe Reverb then this my amp of choice"}
{"source": " It is miles ahead of a Fender Blues Deluxe"}
{"source": "Yes, this is indeed the best amp you will find for the price and the most versatile amp I've played outside of a $2000 mesa boogie"}
{"source": "Buy it"}
{"source": " In fact, buy two"}
{"source": " This is a future classic"}
{"source": "If you are looking for really authentic vintage tones with tube warmth, this is a fantastic amp for you"}
{"source": "Fender has done an amazing job with this amp"}
{"source": "IN this AMP, you have:All of the benefits of tubes, warmth at all dynamic levels, as well as a lot of touch sensitivity to your playing"}
{"source": "The CHAMP Circuit"}
{"source": "  Forget the fact that you have Digital amp models built in too, you also have a 15w Champ tube amp with a 10 inch speaker"}
{"source": "  It's not exactly a '57 champ reissue, but it is the same circuit with all of the character and spanky tone as any Champ out there"}
{"source": "  (People who like a great Champ tone, would pay more than $299 for a great 15w Champ amp"}
{"source": ")Add to this, 16 Digital Presets"}
{"source": "  Fender gives you Digital models through a Tube Circuit of Tweed Amps, Blackface Amps, Hot Rod Amps, as well as Metal Amps, A Jazz amp and an Acoustic sounding Model"}
{"source": "Add to that some preset digital effects including Reverb, Delay, Vibe, Trem and Chorus"}
{"source": "  (Each one has several choices as well as a knob to increase or decrease the presence of the effect"}
{"source": ")Everyone who reviews this amp raves about the how authentic and interesting the Digital Models are"}
{"source": " and they are absolutely right"}
{"source": "But this amp breaks new ground with the simple fact that you can switch directly from playing a song with a Tweed or Hot Rod tone directly to an authentic Champ amp"}
{"source": "  Not a model of a Champ Amp, the real deal!The implications of this amp are really huge"}
{"source": "  I'd love to see Fender do the same thing with a Pro Jr"}
{"source": " or even a Blues Jr"}
{"source": " Amp"}
{"source": "  Perhaps they might go that direction in the future depending on the success of this amp"}
{"source": "  who knows"}
{"source": "  But what I do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character"}
{"source": "The Digital PresetsFor me, the highlights are the authenticity of the Tweed, Blackface and Hot Rod tones"}
{"source": "  I really feel like channel 10 sounds like a clean blues jr coming through the 10 inch speaker"}
{"source": "  The tweed tones are syruppy and awesome"}
{"source": "  The Blackface clean sounds like a Princeton, and I even think they were trying to emulate a Deluxe Reverb on channel 5"}
{"source": "As Far as Volume"}
{"source": "People ask, is it loud enough to gig with?  Sure"}
{"source": "  It can get loud enough over drums etc"}
{"source": "  But, I'd mic it anyway"}
{"source": "  I get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume"}
{"source": "  Mic it and you can play it anywhere"}
{"source": "The Only downsides"}
{"source": "As much as Fender tries to throw a bone to metal heads, this amp really doesn't give Metalheads that much to work with"}
{"source": "  It would be a great practice amp for any guitarist, Blues, Metal, Jazz or Country"}
{"source": "But the Metal tones are not going to be as big and rectified as you would want them if you want to chug through some metallica riffs"}
{"source": "Lack of a Mid Control"}
{"source": "  I'm not sure that I understand why you'd have an EQ with Treble and Bass with no Mid control"}
{"source": "  Personally, it's the EQ knob that I would use the most, but if you are switching between Digital Presets you have to work with the Treble and Bass to find the sweet spot for your mids"}
{"source": "  To my ears, it's not in the same spot on all presets"}
{"source": "  That one knob would make this amp a lot quicker and easier to use for someone like me who likes to bounce between presets"}
{"source": "This amp is cool and unique"}
{"source": " Which is why it will be the first digital modeling amp that is still worth something when Fender releases the next big new thing"}
{"source": "  Line 6 and Vox tube/digital combos have really fallen quite flat and have no resale value after the next generation comes out"}
{"source": "  Fender has found a sweet spot of value, quality and usability"}
{"source": "  This is going to be a rare technological achievement that people will still hang on to and be happy with 10 years later"}
{"source": "Truly a unique and versatile creation"}
{"source": "Well I love da Fender products, always have always will"}
{"source": " I recently built me a nice custom strat, and had been testing out a few of the various mini-tube amps out on the market lately, (which is where I would categorize this amp) even though it has better tubes and more watts"}
{"source": " These are my comparison testing amps, (I own both of the 2 amps below and have also tried a number of others in the music store down the road):Blackheart Killer Ant (12\" Blackheart cabinet)Vox AC4TV8 4-Watt 8\" Compact All-Tube Practice Amp with Celestion VX10 Speaker (also speakered out to the 12\" Blackheart cabinet)I've also tested all my amps in various ways by re-tubing them with a number of my collected tubes:Groove TubesJJ TubesSovtek TubesSvetlana TubesTung-Sol Tubes (gold)and straight out of the box, this thing beat them all of in sound quality, even with what a lot of people are calling a cheap Fender speaker version"}
{"source": " I also plugged \"The Champ\" into my 12\" Blackheart speaker cabinet and it sounded even better using my strat (but I will do more speaker testing later)"}
{"source": " Fender amps have always leaned to sounding better with fender guitars, where as Gibson, Epiphone, type guitars really sound pretty good on the Vox and Blackheart models"}
{"source": "Now when this amp came out, it was way overpriced but as always that price has fallin into a reasonable range"}
{"source": " I mean the price of all of these mini-tube amps are minimal in comparison to the nicer ones, but again this thing is loaded with better guts, so maybe that why it screams better"}
{"source": " ya-hoo, me likey! Better guts, better performance, plus Fender has added an extra range of effects and amp sounds"}
{"source": " Its small in size, light in weight, loud and easy to carry with you for jam sessions"}
{"source": "I swapped out the pickguard on my American Standard to a black one so I figured I'd change the back plate as well"}
{"source": " While nobody really sees the back, it drives me nuts when the front and back don't match"}
{"source": " Because I didn't want to go without a back plate, as some people like to do, I picked this one up"}
{"source": " The holes lined up perfectly and it literally takes less than a minute to install"}
{"source": " You can't go wrong with genuine Fender parts"}
{"source": "Promptly received, nicely packaged with protective film on it"}
{"source": "  Little bit of fiddling with it to get the holes lined up, but overall a very nice part"}
{"source": "  Compliments my B/W/B pickgaurd nicely"}
{"source": " Open slot in the back much more convenient than the series of holes, normally found"}
{"source": "The screw holes are just a shade off for my guitar, and you would think they would want to standardize so they didn't have to carry so many parts"}
{"source": "  Nope, doesn't fit a Squire Affinity, just FYI"}
{"source": "Fit my MIM strat perfectly, not much else to say"}
{"source": "  Always buy Fender parts for Fender guitars, dont be cheap and order china copies on ebay, they wont fit"}
{"source": "I needed a single button switch for my little Mustang I that I practice on"}
{"source": " I've never owned the Fender model switch but I know what it is"}
{"source": " It will do the job but it's lightweight and won't sit flat on the floor if the cord isn't laying exactly right"}
{"source": " I searched a little further and ran across this switch on Amazon by scrolling down a bit"}
{"source": " \"Marshall Footswitch, One Button With LED by AmplifiedParts"}
{"source": "\" Folks, this thing is built like a tank"}
{"source": " The casing is made of heavy duty (I don't know what gauge) solid steel"}
{"source": " There's nothing rinky dink about it"}
{"source": " I plugged it in to the FTSW jack, clicked the button, the LED lit up and the amp switched to the other tagged preset"}
{"source": " Again, light went out and back to the original"}
{"source": " It felt solid under my foot and I don't think one can tear the casing up unless they have a 3 or 4 lb"}
{"source": " sledge hammer"}
{"source": " I don't know how well the electronics will hold up (I just got it today) but the switch, again, feels solid like it's supposed to"}
{"source": " It cost me $20"}
{"source": "90 with shipping"}
{"source": " It takes a couple of days longer to arrive than what we're use to with Amazon but it ships directly from AmplifiedParts, I believe"}
{"source": " I'm a Fender fan but this beats their single switch"}
{"source": " Thanks for reading guys"}
{"source": " Lane H"}
{"source": "Mr Miyagi couldn't have said it any better"}
{"source": "Robust, compact unit which I use with a Fender Rumble 75"}
{"source": " Plenty of lead so I can position it where I need it, and thank heavens for duct tape"}
{"source": "Switches channels on my Mustang II like a charm"}
{"source": " Would have received a 5-star rating had it been in a metal enclosure"}
{"source": " It is plastic, but it suits my needs"}
{"source": "gives a nice little boost on my blues jr, however this is not a replacement for an overdrive pedal in my opinion, just more of a boost"}
{"source": " wish it had a grippy bottom made from rubber vs a smooth bottom made from plastic"}
{"source": "I bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar"}
{"source": " It showed up on amazon when I was doing a search for \"Bass Guitar amps\", other regular guitar amps were not showing up so I was curious about it"}
{"source": " After a bit of searching online to see if a guitar amp would work for practice situations, I thought I would give it a try because some people say yes, others said no"}
{"source": " I wanted to test for myself"}
{"source": " While I did get sound and was able to practice, it didn't have anywhere close to the tone I was hoping for"}
{"source": " So I ended up returning it the next day"}
{"source": " I'm not upset about the amp itself, just that it shows up as a bass amp off the search, which is the only reason I gave it a shot"}
{"source": " For a regular guitar, this would be fine but not bass"}
{"source": " I which they would take bass out of the key words or whatever was in there to trigger this to show up"}
{"source": " I was in the market for a practice amp for under $100 and was hopeful, but what I ended up doing was buying a used Acoustic B20 1X12 Bass Combo Amp for the same price as this new practice amp and I am a lot more satisfied"}
{"source": " Again, this review is strictly on the aspect of a bass guitar, not regular guitar"}
{"source": "If you're a metalhead, STAY AWAY!! I tried this on multiple metal pedals and the peavey Rogue G10 blows it out of the water"}
{"source": " This thing sounds like CRAP with anything distortion"}
{"source": " It's GREAT for jazzy blues and an ultra clean tone though or that classic fender crunch"}
{"source": " But if you demand metal, get far away!"}
{"source": "Should have paid the extra $40 and bought the Mustang - oh well"}
{"source": " The amp has light sound and not much control"}
{"source": " Good for my small space though"}
{"source": "This is a cool little amp for practicing in a small room or playing to a small group of people"}
{"source": "It produces some nice warm tones and can get loud enough for jamming with but is good if you don't want to be too loud"}
{"source": " It has a headphone jack also"}
{"source": " I like this so much I might experiment with miking it for gigs, never thought I would say that about a 10 watt"}
{"source": "Fender choose quality over bells and whistles with this one"}
{"source": " There is an overdrive on/off button with adjustable gain, volume control and a simple treble/bass equalizer"}
{"source": " Other then that it is all rock"}
{"source": " Physically it is built strong too"}
{"source": "This Fender amp is the perfect size to practice or take along"}
{"source": " It sounds great and I like the headphone and MP3 player hookups"}
{"source": " Good value"}
{"source": "I bought one of these a couple of years ago"}
{"source": " I used it to connect my Behringer BCR2000 (in MIDI mode, naturally!) to my computer for mixing duties in REAPER"}
{"source": " It worked with no issues and I had zero complaints"}
{"source": "A few weeks ago it stopped working (I had bent the USB connector and so I thought that was the culprit) so I bought another"}
{"source": "The replacement arrived and installed with no issues, but I'm still having trouble getting it to send MIDI data into the computer"}
{"source": " MIDI out of the computer to the Behringer is fine"}
{"source": " I'm not sure if this is due to the adapter or some funky Windows update that's happened lately, but it's certainly not ideal! :(In my haste, having seen it install OK but without trying to actually use it, I discarded the packaging"}
{"source": " Unfortunately the replacement is displaying the same symptoms as the first unit, so now it looks like I'm stuck with two possibly-broken USB / MIDI interfaces"}
{"source": " I have reinstalled Windows, tried both with another computer, uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers, all kinds of good stuff and I still can't get either of them to send MIDI data into the computer"}
{"source": " I was v-e-r-y close to throwing my Behringer unit away as I thought it was broken too!Thankfully I tried an old Yamaha interface and it is OK"}
{"source": " This means I just need to get and buy some MIDI cables and I'll be back in business"}
{"source": "So, I'd say buy one of these, and make sure it works before you throw your packaging away! When they work they're absolutely great and they're SO cheap! If you receive a lemon, return it and order another"}
{"source": " It's worth it if you're not in a hurry"}
{"source": " If you *are* in  a hurry then order a few of them, or just get something else"}
{"source": "I'd also like to advise people that reports of MIDI latency with these devices is quite probably a misnomer"}
{"source": " I strongly suspect that the speed of transferring MIDI data into your computer through this device is much faster than you think, and the actual latency you're experiencing is that of converting your MIDI data into audio"}
{"source": " This happens inside your computer and has **nothing** to do with this device's performance; it's purely down to your hardware and software configurations"}
{"source": " All this talk of ASIO is only really going to help you on the audio side of things"}
{"source": " If you're using this device to record MIDI data then you should have no issues at all"}
{"source": " as long as you get one that works! :-)Cheers"}
{"source": "Doesn't wotk with V-Amp 3"}
{"source": "  Doubt it works at all"}
{"source": "  Red light always stays on and I've never seen the green light"}
{"source": "We went to the local GC to try out different guitars, mostly blind to the price, just looking to see what we liked best"}
{"source": "  After a couple of hours, we found ourselves repeatedly coming back to the Cordoba C5"}
{"source": "  It has a nice resonant sound, good playability, and very attractive finish"}
{"source": "  The room we were in at GC had classical guitars up to $1200 and we really didn't find a guitar we liked better"}
{"source": "  We had a $50 coupon, so we bought it from GC, but afterwards took it to our local music shop to have their tech look it over for us"}
{"source": "  He was also very impressed, especially with the fact that unlike most classicals, this one has a truss rod adjustment"}
{"source": "  It required only some minor adjustments and not a complete setup"}
{"source": "These picks come in a large range of sizes, but most of them are way too thick to play any guitar with"}
{"source": "There is a really funny smell to these when you first use them that gets on your fingers, but it goes away after a bit"}
{"source": "They seem to be decent quality"}
{"source": " The thin picks have not torn on me yet and the medium gauge picks dont wear down too quickly"}
{"source": "These are ok to have around the house to play with but I would not recommend them for live performance"}
{"source": "very smart & handy design that my acoustic guitar doesn't have to be drilled a hole for"}
{"source": "  it's very easy to buckle the guitar strap on the neck & its botton button of the guitar, that is!"}
{"source": "I have a Martin D35 acoustic and strapping it with the string knot around the neck is honestly a bit annoying to do - so i figure what's a $10 investment going to do for me?make things easier and CLEANER LOOKING - that's what!i like it because it really just makes puting the strap on the guitar that much easier and removing it again an easy task"}
{"source": "I bought the martin strap to match the color"}
{"source": "Martin 18AMS2 Martin Leather Guitar Strap - Brownjust being a martin brand nut i suppose!"}
{"source": "The connection strap is a great enhancement for my D18 and fits wonderfully"}
{"source": " Just one caution"}
{"source": "I noticed a couple of scratches on the neck near the Headstock and finally determined that the \"Button\" was pressing on the neck when in the case"}
{"source": "(I have occasion to pack and unpack several times per month)  It's easy to connect and disconnect so that's the \"Prevention Mode\" I now have in place"}
{"source": " Wonderful set-up and I highly recommend it to to ALL Martin Owners!"}
{"source": "This audio adapter works perfectly"}
{"source": "  Why spend any more than you have to to get rich sounding audio"}
{"source": "  I'm able to use headphones and listen to a song while a different song is playing through the main speakers"}
{"source": "The audio jack on my laptop was failing"}
{"source": "  I had to wiggle and twist the headphone plug until I could hear both channels"}
{"source": "  By that time half the youtube video was over"}
{"source": "  What a hassle!  I'm trying to imagine how can I crack the case, get in there with my soldering gun to replace the audio jack when I ran across this great idea"}
{"source": "  A plug-and-play USB device with both input and output audio jacks"}
{"source": "  Took about one minute to install on my Dell Inspiron, which recognized it immediately"}
{"source": "  Problem solved quickly and elegantly"}
{"source": "Shipping was free and prompt from the Amazon partner"}
{"source": "  Good job, Platinum Micro, Inc"}
{"source": "I understand the input jack is mono so don't try to use this as a quasi recording studio"}
{"source": "  And consider the availability and accessibility of your USB ports"}
{"source": "  Then, order this great little solution to a big problem"}
{"source": "I've owned just about every muff"}
{"source": "  No Triangle or Civil War"}
{"source": "  But this is my favorite muff thus far"}
{"source": "  Way more versatile than any other muff"}
{"source": "  The switches involment in the the circuit really isn't too elaborate, but then again all bypasses aren't"}
{"source": "  I love wicker on and tone off"}
{"source": "  Cuts like a buffalo"}
{"source": "  I hate to have a bunch of fuzz's and distortions in my chain, but its there right next to a Keeley Fuzz Head, a Analogman Peppermint Fuzz, and a TS-9 modded to an 808 w/ Brown that I modded myself"}
{"source": "  I love this Muff!  I can't wait to see what they do next"}
{"source": "  Plus"}
{"source": "  These new EHX pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass"}
{"source": "  If you like muffs, you'll really like this one"}
{"source": "  If you didn't like muffs before, you'll probably like the wicker feature, it makes it far more clear and pronounced and less of a glob a goo and more distortion/ fuzz friendly"}
{"source": "  I give it four stars, because the five is only meant meant for devices that you just freak out and half to have, for me the Keeley Fuzz Head is a five, I love that thing"}
{"source": "This pedal is awesome"}
{"source": " I use it the most of all my pedals, because it's pretty much perfect"}
{"source": " I can get 4 completely different sounds out of it"}
{"source": " It's also true-bypass, so it will not effect your tone when it is off"}
{"source": " It's much smaller than the big muff pi, which is good because it takes less room on your pedalboard"}
{"source": " Just to let you all know, this is NOT an overdrive or distortion pedal"}
{"source": " It is a fuzz pedal"}
{"source": " So don't buy it expecting overdrive"}
{"source": " Also, when it's turned on you will hear a hum, but the web says that it has to do with flourescent lights, and muff pedals hum alot"}
{"source": " None of that makes me dislike the pedal"}
{"source": " It's one of the hest fuzz pedals ever"}
{"source": " I use it in front of a wah, and that's all I'll ever need to use pedal-wise"}
{"source": " Get this pedal!!!!!!!"}
{"source": "As a disclaimer, I am not a Big Muff connoisseur"}
{"source": "  I've never owned one before this"}
{"source": "  I also tend not to like fuzz as an effect"}
{"source": "  I'd characterize this box as a cross between distortion and fuzz, maintaining enough definition for chord work"}
{"source": "  If you're reading the reviews, you've probably already done your research on the features, but I'll cover them anyway"}
{"source": "Three simple controls, Volume - Tone - Sustain, with the Sustain control being more or less a Gain control"}
{"source": "  The enclosure is a smaller, pedalboard-friendly size"}
{"source": "  The pedal incorporates two of the (supposedly) most popular Big Muff mods with switches, Tone and Wicker"}
{"source": "  When Tone is switched off, the Tone control and its tone-shaping circuitry are completely disconnected"}
{"source": "  In this mode, the distortion applies to the entire tonal spectrum evenly, and it also produces a significant volume boost"}
{"source": "  The Tone knob does nothing"}
{"source": "When Wicker is switched on, it removes three high-frequency rolloff filters that were added to the original Big Muff circuit to smooth out the sound"}
{"source": "  Disconnecting these makes the sound a bit raspier and rougher, with a high-end frequency boost"}
{"source": "I use this pedal running into a mild overdrive, the Catalinbread Dirty Little Secret, which \"conditions\" the signal"}
{"source": "  I play with the Tone off and Wicker on, and even with the Volume and Sustain controls set fairly low, this combination results in a wonderfully thick, massive distorted tone that is still pretty smooth"}
{"source": "If you're looking to get a Big Muff, and you're not a snob about which version, the switchable mods on this one are really great for experimenting to find your own sound"}
{"source": "  Not to mention that, at this price point, it will be much cheaper than some vintage Muffs"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended"}
{"source": "First things first, this is a fuzz pedal (and on the heavy side) which mean it provides thick ground shaking distortion and sustain"}
{"source": "  This is very different from normal distortion so noise is to be expected whether you are playing or not"}
{"source": "Second, a true bypass switch (like in the Big Muff)is a mechanical switch as opposed to Boss type pedals that have buffers which color your sound even when they are off"}
{"source": "  Mechanical switches make noise are are louder the more durable they are"}
{"source": "Ok so now to the actual sound which is amazing"}
{"source": "  This pedal has a tone of versatility because not only do you have a lot of options on the pedal itself but it reacts dynamically to the knobs on your guitar"}
{"source": "  Since I play a Les Paul with 57 classics I will often turn the volume down to 8 when using this otherwise the bass can be overwhelming (but awesome)"}
{"source": " Strat and Tele players probably wont have the same issue with single coils"}
{"source": "  In addition the Wicker and Tone features all for more sounds that just the original Big Muff or you can just turn them off to get the original sound"}
{"source": "Great for: Black Keys (they use a big muff), Weezer (think My Name is Jonas), certain Greenday songs, and basically anything where you need thick and deep fuzz with the option to tone it down if need be"}
{"source": "It works! This guitar support couldn't be simpler"}
{"source": " The neck rest is a molded plastic cup with that soft spongy material inside the neck support"}
{"source": " The mat is a thick light weight foam mat (a bit like a yoga mat) with a hole cut in it"}
{"source": " The neck support cup goes through that hole"}
{"source": " That's it for set up"}
{"source": " The mat protects the guitar body"}
{"source": " The support cup holds the guitar at exactly the right angle to work on it, change strings, adjust the truss rod, work on the pickups, or clean the guitar"}
{"source": " The guitar can be placed in strings up or down"}
{"source": "This wouldn't be a difficult DIY project, but I'd be missing out on that cool Fender logo if I made this out of wood and a yoga mat"}
{"source": " Honestly, this looks really sharp put together"}
{"source": "The whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube"}
{"source": " That tube is an excellent storage tube"}
{"source": "The description says it all but I was still wondering if I made the right choice because I was comparing the \"Fender Accessories 099-0502-000 Guitar Tools\" -what the heck kind of name is that anyway?!- with NO reviews to theJim Dunlop NC65  Formula 65 Neck Cradle Maintenance Stationthat had some pretty good reviews"}
{"source": "Well, I cannot speak for the Dunlop but I can say that this kit is light weight, self-contained, has storage space in it, and it works if the guitar is face-up or face down"}
{"source": "It also has pad to keep your guitar from sliding - and the pad keeps the neck rest in place so it does not topple over!  I do not see anything like that mentioned in the Dunlop NC65"}
{"source": "On top of it, I think the neck rest & pad inGuitar Setup & Maintenance - Instructional Guitar DVD With Denny Rauenis this one turned over so the \"Fender\" logo is not showing"}
{"source": "Yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows"}
{"source": " But this tool is very well designed"}
{"source": " It keeps the guitar from sliding and positions it at a nice angle for maintenance"}
{"source": " In storage mode, the mat rolls up into the clear plastic tube and takes up very little space"}
{"source": " The bottom cover doubles as a storage compartment for your hex wrenches, string winder, and feeler guages"}
{"source": "But the real reason I give this product five stars is because it allows me to work on my guitars while keeping them in perfect condition"}
{"source": " That increases their resale value, so the tool pays for itself"}
{"source": " And it gives me a lot of pleasure to have the right tools for the job"}
{"source": " With the right tools, I enjoy working on my guitars almost as much as playing them"}
{"source": " While I hear what those complaining of the high cost are saying, I am used to paying higher prices for good tools and I think this qualifies as a good tool"}
{"source": " I used it to put new pickups in and setup my Squier Stratocaster last night without damaging my guitar"}
{"source": " Without this tool, I don't think I would have been so lucky"}
{"source": "This is a must have! Really! It is pack very well, and I use it everyday!Please get one of these if you are tried of paying someone to do your guitar setup"}
{"source": "Long wait for overpriced item"}
{"source": "  Arrived on time but there was a 3 week wait"}
{"source": " Overpriced but was expected as Fender name on product"}
{"source": "Not much to day, it's a polishing cloth, it cleans your guitar, and it does it right"}
{"source": " Good price too, nothing to complain about"}
{"source": "Yup, it's O"}
{"source": "K"}
{"source": "  Nothing special"}
{"source": "  I don't know if it's the best one out there but it does the job"}
{"source": "This Fender Treated Polish Cloth; a soft ecru colored cloth with a cut scalloped edge all around is asimple product"}
{"source": " The classic Fender logo is in the left upper quadrant of the cloth"}
{"source": " The resealableplastic bag this cloth came in had a label that read, 'FENPC1' and states it's size as being, 12 inchesby 15 inches"}
{"source": "Well, its size, as I measured it, is actually 12 inches by 14-5/8 inches"}
{"source": " Just wanted to mention itbecause I have seen some people get mighty upset about things like this"}
{"source": " Me, no problem"}
{"source": " The missing3/8 of an inch is a minor detail"}
{"source": " Go to a lumber yard some time and look for 2x4s"}
{"source": " Now, you won'tactually find any actual '2x4's"}
{"source": " They've been shrinking for over 50 years"}
{"source": "I am not sure what this cloth is *treated* with but it does not feel any different than the UN-treatedGibson polishing cloths I have purchased"}
{"source": " I also gave it the nose test"}
{"source": " I thought there  might be a hintof, or a whiff of, some polish or something"}
{"source": " Nope"}
{"source": " No scent"}

{"source": "  Back to the review"}
{"source": "The Fender cloth is just as soft and just a little bit bigger than the Gibson cloths but not much differencebetween the two"}
{"source": " Well, the Gibson cloth does have a whip-stitch edging around it"}
{"source": " Other than THAT, notmuch difference"}
{"source": "When I use the Fender cloth on my Fender guitar there were no marks left and no smudges left"}
{"source": " I  like tokeep the neck especially clean and polished on a regular basis and it seemed to do a good job at that"}
{"source": " Idon't use it on the body that much because it is not as exposed to my dirty oily hands as much as theneck"}
{"source": "So, based on the fact that Fender made a cloth that does not scratch or smudge my guitar I will give thisamazingly boring and uninteresting ecru colored cloth 4 stars"}
{"source": " It appears to do  what it supposed to do,and that is polish your guitar without harming it"}
{"source": "It gets one less star because of the California Prop 65 warning"}
{"source": " I suppose I need to take this a somewhatseriously so I docked it one star"}
{"source": " I will definitely be washing my hand right after using it"}
{"source": "So far no harm has been done to any guitars in the writing of this review"}
{"source": " For the future I am not so sureabout me"}
{"source": " Thank you, and say, 'Goodnight', Gracie"}
{"source": "Note About Vendor: GO-DPS responded admirably when my cloth did not show up on time"}
{"source": " It was 4 dayspast the delivery date"}
{"source": " I e-mailed them"}
{"source": " They responded quickly and then put another cloth in the mail tome that came in an appropriate amount of time"}
{"source": " For such an inexpensive item they went the distance incustomer service"}
{"source": " I will use them again in the future"}
{"source": "Nic epiece of cloth to wipe my strings and it looks cool with fender on it"}
{"source": " happy buyer Thank you very much"}
{"source": "Nothing exciting about these things, but they do the job well"}
{"source": " I polished my 1991 Gibson Les Paul with this recently and I'd forgotten how shiny and beautiful that guitar was"}
{"source": " Does a great job"}
{"source": "They have no grip at all they brake and ware out in a hour or so of hard playing there just junk for newbie that don`t know any beter but hey what do you expect they are made by D Addario get some real picks like Dunlop Tortex"}
{"source": "Always looking for reasonable pricing"}
{"source": "  The picks were as good as advertised online, it met our expectations and pricing was good"}
{"source": "10 picks medium which came in a clearly marked pack from the company"}
{"source": " Cheaper than going into town and mailed directly to me"}
{"source": " Good deal"}
{"source": " Will order again!"}
{"source": "These work fine; no cracking, they come in a nice assortment of colors, and they're easy to see when they get dropped"}
{"source": "I have played guitar for about 12 years and these picks are now my favorite picks ever"}
{"source": " I can't really explain why, they just feel right"}
{"source": " Sometimes they break, but what pick light pick doesn't unless it's nylon?"}
{"source": "I like the Jim Dunlop "}
{"source": "60mm pitch black guitar picks best"}

{"source": "  Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg"}
{"source": "Love the colors and the price can't be beat"}
{"source": " Wished maybe they came in yellow? Other than that, great picks"}
{"source": "I'm new to the guitar and I'm just discovering how to use picks and what picks work best (for me) with different guitars and different effects"}
{"source": " I like these for my acoustic Ibanez dreadnaught"}
{"source": " The pick seems to help me get that deep bluesy sound from the D'addario strings"}
{"source": " They are comfortable and I like the feel in my hand"}
{"source": " The mediums suit me"}
{"source": " Maybe it is all personal taste but I think they are worth buying"}
{"source": " Amazon pricing is great"}
{"source": " The picks feel great and I'm having a good time"}
{"source": "Great picks!  Nice flexibility and easy playing no matter what your style"}
{"source": "I would recommend these for any guitar player!"}
{"source": "Good picks but not a replacement for jazz 3 that I still prefer over this one, nice backup in case you run out"}
{"source": "I'm really happy with the Black Ice Heavy picks (1"}
{"source": "10 mm), which I bought after being badly disappointed with my last order of Dunlop Jazz IIIs"}
{"source": "I would call the Black Ice picks medium sized"}
{"source": "  They are roughly the same size and shape as Fender 551 picks, but a little bigger than the Jazz IIIs"}
{"source": "  They are stiffer than the 551s and perhaps a touch less stiff than the IIIs (and thinner than the IIIs too)"}
{"source": "One thing that may account for the nice way the Black Ice perform is that the edges are beveled and smoothly finished in a way which differs from the 551s (which I still like) and from the Jazz IIIs"}
{"source": "In terms of playability, they are about the same to me as any other pick of this shape and stiffness"}
{"source": "But the most important thing to me is the hardest thing to communicate to you:  The tone"}
{"source": "  I love the tone I get with these picks, and the best I can do for you is to say that I was looking for a pick that would generate a solid, mellow jazz tone with an archtop - a tone that reminds me of say, Barney Kessel (but without Barney's chops of coursse)"}
{"source": "  This is what the Black Ice delivers"}
{"source": "They are comfortable to use"}
{"source": "  The Planet Wave logo gives me a nice grip on the pick; and I like heavy picks, so the \"heavy\" option fits my preference"}
{"source": "  I've got a gig tomorrow night, so we'll see how they work then"}
{"source": "Like many say, they do slip out easy so you need to keep that in mind, otherwise for the price and overall quality they are good cables"}
{"source": "Well made, sturdy, and adequate for use on a pedal board or just to connect various pedals via the traditional way"}
{"source": "What can I say, these are great patch cables"}
{"source": "Solid connection, not too to stiff and no harmonics that I could detect"}
{"source": "  And I've had crappy cables that buzzed when you looked at them cross-eyed - these don't do that"}
{"source": "  No gold connectors and if you need the best of the best maybe you should be looking elsewhere"}
{"source": "  For the rest of us, who are looking for good stuff at a good price, these are the ticket"}
{"source": "Highly recommended"}
{"source": "These cords seem to be a hair longer than the conventional pedal-to-pedal cords, which is nice"}
{"source": "  They also seem to be quality without bulky"}
{"source": "  Some \"quality\" cords I've purchased in the past were stiff and bulky, when I needed more flexibility"}
{"source": "  These cords strike that balance perfectly"}
{"source": "Quality and value, so you can't go wrong"}
{"source": "UPDATE:I've lowered my 4 star rating down to 3"}
{"source": "  Over time, about half of these cords have developed a problem of coming unplugged from the pedal they plugged into, and this seems to be a unique problem with just these cords"}
{"source": "  About half have worked great, the other half have this odd little issue"}
{"source": "Right size, well made, and these do the job"}
{"source": " I prefer them at 90 degrees, so these are just right"}
{"source": "I bought a bunch of these when I started building my pedal board"}
{"source": "They're very inexpensive, but seemingly quite high quality"}
{"source": "Tons of bang for your buck"}
{"source": "Seemingly no tone loss, no added noise, and no coloration"}
{"source": "The right angle ends are a little big and bulky, they may not do so well on a tight and jam packed board"}
{"source": "But for average boards they work great!I gig and record with these"}
{"source": " Great product!Only negative check b/c the ends are too bulky"}
{"source": "I have been playing for 17 years and have seen alot of patch cables"}
{"source": " These are great quality and for the price you cant go wrong"}
{"source": " These are currently the only cables I use on my pedalboard"}
{"source": " Short of monster or mogami, these are the best you can get for the money"}
{"source": "Worked perfectly for my needs"}
{"source": " I don't have a ton of pedals and just needed a few patch cables to connect them all"}
{"source": " When it comes to quality of cables, I'm really not to picky about it"}
{"source": " I know there's a bunch of gear snobs that turn their noses at anything they consider &#34;inferior&#34; in quality, which usually, from my observation, has to do with cheap affordable prices equaling bad quality and higher end merchandise is always super expensive"}
{"source": " If you need some patch cables for your rig, these will do just fine"}
{"source": "These cables are excellent quality cables, however, if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup, these cables are rather bulky and stiff"}
{"source": "The large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer, especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as Hosa"}
{"source": "Bought it after read reviews"}
{"source": " I had signal loss using these cables"}
{"source": " it's like having a loose connection inside the cable"}
{"source": " My connections were on and off, I thought I had a dead pedal"}
{"source": " I have to wiggle and hold to get signal"}
{"source": " It's too flexible almost like Twizzlers (no kidding!)"}
{"source": " If you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables, go get the one from Pro Co, I bought it very cheap from Sweetwater on Ebay, surprisingly very good quality and looks durable!"}
{"source": "I've been buying these strings for a while now"}
{"source": " They sound clean and crisp"}
{"source": " The best part is the price"}
{"source": "Nice light set of strings allows easy fingering allowing for longer play/practice periods and less finger fatigue"}
{"source": " I would recommend these for anyone who likes the light and lively sound of an acoustic"}
{"source": " especially good for beginners"}
{"source": "Good grippy picks for some types of playing"}
{"source": " I go back and forth between these and the Jazz IIIs when I'm in a Jazz pick kind of mood (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ": when I'm not using ginormous Gypsy Jazz picks or Fender heavies"}
{"source": " I especially dig Davas (all models) for acoustic playing and strumming"}
{"source": " Nice tone as well"}
{"source": " Have tried pretty much every Dava and each has its pluses for specific kinds of playing"}
{"source": "One thing about Davas is that once in a while the pick will slightly move in my grip, and I'll pick the string with the rubber"}
{"source": " Hand angle can also play a part in this"}
{"source": " Probably just me"}
{"source": "I've been trying out different picks for a few weeks now looking for the perfect one for hybrid picking"}
{"source": " So far this is the one and I think my search is actually over"}
{"source": " I've tried theJim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz Iii Ply Pkand that was close but this is the one"}
{"source": " These Davas have a great feel in my bigger fingers, doesn't slip around at all and is very sharp and fast on alternate and hybrid picking"}
{"source": " Pick noise has also been reduced because there is much less friction than with most others; the notes ring out very clearly even on fast runs"}
{"source": "I've used Dunlop Jazz III's for years but always had a problem when it came to a song that required a lot of strumming"}
{"source": " The DAVA changes that for me"}
{"source": " Not only does it allow for accurate picking, but it also allows you to strum when needed - just roll your thumb back a little (works great)"}
{"source": " I've been using this pick for about 2 months now and have not gone back to any of my other picks"}
{"source": " A definite 5 star for being my favorite new pick!!! You won't be dissapointed!!!"}
{"source": "Have been a user of Jazz III picks lately (Max Grip version:Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks - 6 Pack) but was having some difficulty with those picks during rhythmic sections that required lots of strumming"}
{"source": "Was recommended to these picks by other users so I gave them a shot"}
{"source": " A few of my notes:- This pick is very slightly bigger than the Jazz iiis i linked above"}
{"source": " I like this a lot"}
{"source": " The tip is almost exactly the same size, but the top grip area is ever so slightly bigger"}
{"source": " Still, these picks are significantly smaller than your \"average\" size pick"}
{"source": "- The rubber grip area is a joy to hold"}
{"source": " Very comfortable, very stable, lots of grip- If you didn't know, Dava picks dont come in varying thickness"}
{"source": " They are instead \"control\" picks"}
{"source": " Meaning depending on where you grip the pick it will become more or less rigid"}
{"source": " Look at the picture --- see those three horizontal lines in the middle of the pick? Those are reference markers --- choke up on the pick (lowest line near the tip) for leads and pull back for more flexible strumming"}
{"source": " This will take me some time to get used to but it is pretty nice in theory"}
{"source": " However, even choking up on the pick, it is not as rigid as the jazz iiis and sometimes for fast work I was wishing I was still holding the jazz iii"}
{"source": "- These Dava Jazz come in three colors: Red (Delrin material), Yellow (Nylon material), Orange (Gel)"}
{"source": " Different materials produce different sounds/feels"}
{"source": " Also, in my opinion, the gel is a little harder than the other two"}
{"source": "Hope this review helped"}
{"source": "Title says it all I guess, it gives you the small pick feeling without the thickness (that I'm not crazy about in Dunlops), and the traction is certainly better in my oversweating hands"}
{"source": " Bought these 3 months ago and I've got to say they're very durable too, certainly more so than the small-pick alternatives I tried"}
{"source": "While I have heard that these devices can be great for recording concerts and have heard some great recordings to back that claim up my review will be focusing on my main use which is podcasting"}
{"source": "  After using the Zoom H4N for a few weeks I've found it to be a very versatile tool that should be in any podcaster's arsenal of gear"}
{"source": "I mainly use the H4N to record my podcasts using a Allen & Heath ZED14 mixing board"}
{"source": "  I usually do a two person podcast where I am in one location and the other person is brought in via Skype"}
{"source": "  Using the Aux sends of the board and the 4 track mode of the H4N I can record myself in one channel, the other person in another channel and all of the sound effects and music supplied by my iPad into its own stereo channel"}
{"source": "  This makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track"}
{"source": "The sound quality of the H4N is excellent and it is very easy to hook up external microphones to the unit"}
{"source": "  You can hook up either two XLR microphones or two 1/4&#34; jack sources (or a combination) to the bottom of the unit and there is one 1/8&#34; input on the back of the unit that will accept a stereo microphone or any line level stereo source"}
{"source": "  It's the combination of these that lets me record the podcast onto the 4 separate tracks"}
{"source": "The H4N will also let you record using two attached microphones and the internal microphones at the same time as well, which could be useful if you're looking to capture some background noise if you are recording something on location or say to mix the crowd reaction to a soundboard feed"}
{"source": "Overall this is a great device for podcasters both in the studio and out in the field, letting you produce high quality recordings in both environments"}
{"source": "  Five stars without a doubt"}
{"source": "I purchased the H4n after being unhappy with the H2's performance most significant where I couldn't record a good sounding signal that wasn't distorted with the Line In jack"}
{"source": "  Only to find that the H4n has the same problem but not as bad"}
{"source": "  If I try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the H4n's 1/4 inch jacks, it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal"}
{"source": "  It appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp, adjusting the gain doesn't correct it"}
{"source": "  I contacted Zoom's tech support about the H2 and was told that I likely had a defective unit"}
{"source": "  I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviews"}
{"source": "I really like the H4n's design, the menus and controls are nicely organized"}
{"source": "  It feels more sturdy than the H2"}
{"source": "  The recording quality using the built in mics is excellent"}
{"source": "  Most other recorders in this price range don't have XLR inputs"}
{"source": "  Since I plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board, if the line in jacks don't work properly and can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, I can't use this for what I bought it for"}
{"source": "  I have used my Sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems"}
{"source": "  I've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the Zoom products are the only ones where I have encountered this problem"}
{"source": "  If you are using this to record with mics, it works great, but if you need to record from line level sources, the Zoom recorders may not be a good choice"}
{"source": "  I exchanged this for the Tascam DR-07 and while the Tascam doesn't have as many bells and whistles, It is a nice recorder and I'm very happy with it"}
{"source": "Pros:1) records excellent audio through built in mics2) records excellent audio through all the inputs and is very portable and versatile"}
{"source": "3) I love the 4 track ability and the effects built in to the device"}
{"source": "  I can record multiple things in less time especially when I'm just messing around to get a feel for a song4) comes with a memory card and batteries so it was ready to go out of the box"}
{"source": "Cons:1) battery life is weak2) built in mics have to be placed very well so not to pick up other noises and only what you want"}
{"source": "Yes!!!! finally"}
{"source": "after reading endless tons of reviews on several types of recorders I hit the nail!!!! Ok"}
{"source": "I play in a really LOUD metal band"}
{"source": "none of us are record savvy or anything like that"}
{"source": "we just want to rehearse and rock the hell out"}
{"source": " But we needed a tool to catch band practices and of course remember \"that riff\" for the next rehearsal"}
{"source": " We tried various recorders but always to complicated for just a practice, well the ZOOM H4N changed everything"}
{"source": " Simple to use and the quality of the recordings are just"}
{"source": "well INCREDIBLE"}
{"source": "for such a little thing"}
{"source": "no distortion of any kind (just be careful where you place it)"}
{"source": " I still need to read a lot of the users manual"}
{"source": "but take my word"}
{"source": "I hate those manuals"}
{"source": "I figure how to use it (extremely basic) and just hit the REC button and rock out"}
{"source": " Finally when I came back home I plug it into my pc and I was amazed by the quality of the sound"}
{"source": "we recorded in 4CH mode with two extra mics"}
{"source": "and man"}
{"source": "I havent even tried the multi channel mode yet!!!thanks ZOOM"}
{"source": "now rocking and basic recording it's how it's supposse to be"}
{"source": "SIMPLE AND FUN"}
{"source": "cheers!!!"}
{"source": "Although the big push these days by Samson/Zoom is on behalf of their latest entry, the pint-sized H1, the H2 is still outselling it"}
{"source": "  Perhaps for good reason"}
{"source": "  Amazon's price has the H2 going for less than a 50% mark-up from the H1, yet only the H2 offers a sound stage as wide as 360 degrees and is almost as portable and easy to slip into a pocket as the H1"}
{"source": "  The latter offers the now popular X/Z mic configuration, but they're \"fixed\" mics"}
{"source": " if you wanted to ensure the widest separation, you'd be unable to aim the mics in opposing directions"}
{"source": "  Also, the H2 can be set down on a flat surface more securely and is less sensitive to microphonics from touching any part of the machine"}
{"source": "  I've owned both machines and have found the construction quality wanting, the SD door broke loose on the HD2, and the on-off switch came loose on the H1"}
{"source": "  Both are somewhat tricky to operate, with settings that are not visible in dark places and which nonetheless require agile, accurate, and quick, small fingers"}
{"source": "  (Some users are bound to react negatively to the minuscule size of the H1's micro-SDHC storage cards"}
{"source": ")  Both are capable of full-bodied, full frequencied high-fidelity audio, but you have to remember to treat them gently"}
{"source": "The Zoom Q3 video recorder strikes me as the best built of the bunch, as it's solid metal practically through and through, and the limited settings make it easier to use than either the H1 or H2"}
{"source": "  However, I found it impractical to use at a concert where where the included video component distracted the listeners behind me"}
{"source": "  Also, with its size and bright-blue color it's anything but a stealth machine"}
{"source": "This brings us to the 4th (and most expensive) Zoom, the H4n"}
{"source": "  It's the most versatile of the Zooms, not only permitting movement of the mics but the addition of external mics for authentic mixing"}
{"source": "  Still, the build quality is not notably superior to the H2, and of the 4 Zooms, it's the fussiest, intended for a user whose willing to take some time to become familiar with its versatile learning curve"}
{"source": "  After less than satisfying experiences with the first 3 Zooms, I sent the H4n back in favor of the Sony PCM-50, which is constructed like a Hummer compared to the plastic of the Zooms"}
{"source": "  I see that Amazon's description of the Sony is misleading, since the PCM-50 will NOT permit the user to record in MP3 format"}
{"source": "  WAV is the only format it offers, which simplifies the recording process, allowing the user to select file size with the software program used during the editing process"}
{"source": "  (The only down side is the limited duration of WAV, requiring the user to employ a Sony Sound Stick in addition to the built-in storage"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "Overall, as with most Zoom products, this unit is a winner and cannot be touched by it's competition in it's price category except for perhaps the Olympus LS11 which is cheaper but the Zoom has a ton more features"}
{"source": "Build quality is good, features are good (the only unit in it's price range to have combi XLR / 1/4\" TRS inputs) and it records to a high quality"}
{"source": "However, I think Zoom almost went too far with features and perhaps they could have focused more on making it THE BEST digital recorder under a grand and making it a great USB digital interface instead of spending money on the 4 track feature and all the built in effects and other fluff that works O"}
{"source": "K"}
{"source": " but is much more easily realized in a simple digital 4 track recorder (e"}
{"source": "g a Tascam PocketStudio)The manual is a farse in Japanese /English translation and any person that does not have experience with recording devices like this might really struggle to learn how to use this unit (although it's fairly intuitive to operate if one is familiar with such devices - I gave up on the manual and just dug around in the menus, but the unit is still a little 'fiddly' to operate in advanced modes"}
{"source": "My last comment is in regards to the H4n as a USB interface"}
{"source": " I have played with it a bit and so far it does not make a good interface"}
{"source": " First of all it is only 16 bit and I can only get it to work with MME drivers"}
{"source": " I have read that there are some ASIO drivers available for Windows 7 but I use XP"}
{"source": " I may try to use ASIO4all but it is still only 16 bit and therefore not much use for serious interface work"}
{"source": " There is a direct monitor function but there still seems to be some timing issues when multitracking with a DAW software (I have only tried it with Cakewalk Sonar)"}
{"source": " I had hoped to use it with my laptop as a portable interface but sadly I can't seeing it being of much use in this regard"}
{"source": "However, overall the unit is stellar and I highly recommend it"}
{"source": "PS"}
{"source": " I read some folks having issues with line inputs (e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": " recording a stereo mix from a mixer)"}
{"source": " I personally don't see the problem, the inputs are designed to accept a variety of signal types"}
{"source": " If it is not working for your situation one can always use a TRS Hi Z unbalanced to XLR Low Z balanced converter, available at Radio Shack for around 20 bucks"}
{"source": "This pedal has tone! its very easy to use and program, I did not have idea on how to use it, and really quick I got it, it has a great interface, it sounds great, you just need some time to adapt and you will be creating your own tones in no time"}
{"source": "The distrosion is great some people say they arent but I really love them, its a matter of  taste and creating your tones, some preset may not be good for youThe downside it does not have the AC adapter but I knew this"}
{"source": "The lights under certain light conditions are very bright,But this pedal is note heavy, well constructed and sturdy, I got the AC adapter so I dont have to be on the batteries all the time"}
{"source": "This pedal has the whole package, effects, great tone, great distorsion and cleans"}
{"source": "The Boss ME-70 is not as nice as the BOSS GT-10 and will not let you install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg"}
{"source": "  I recommend getting a BOSS GT-10 and then install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg"}
{"source": "  Now your guitar can sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound with BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg"}
{"source": "  Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg"}
{"source": "I agree with other reviews that Boss exploits its customers by insisting the $300 pedal have the PSA supply, but sells it separately"}
{"source": "  It's a cheesy way to meet a price point without really doing it"}
{"source": "  I used a OneSpot power supply I had already, and it works fine"}
{"source": "  Just glad I didn't have to shell out $20 more to Boss for something they should have provided with the ME70"}
{"source": "The first thing I noticed is that the tuner is not too good"}
{"source": "  You get a letter, with an arrow on each side, and it's not very responsive"}
{"source": "The Korg-style dial-in reverb controls are easy, but extremely limited"}
{"source": "  Expected better"}
{"source": "  You get either room or hall"}
{"source": "  Neither are that realistic"}
{"source": "Going from manual patch-level to bank-level is awkward"}
{"source": "  It may just take practice"}
{"source": "Next thing I noticed is the delay level does not respond as expected"}
{"source": "  If I set the E"}
{"source": " level (delayed signal level, or balance) at around thirty, it can be clearly heard"}
{"source": "  When overdrive or boost is added the primary signal is boosted as expected, but the delayed signal remains at the original volume, effectively reducing the balance and making the delayed signal nearly inaudible"}
{"source": "Did Boss just start making multi-effects pedals?  Have they learned nothing?Despite somewhat mediocre performance and design, the ME70 does have features that recommend it"}
{"source": "  Some of the drives are usable"}
{"source": "  The controls are accessible and easy to adjust"}
{"source": "  The \"Solo\" setting on the Comp/FX module is a nice booster, although it can apparently be overdriven easily by the boost in the OD/DS module - maybe this is by design but it would be nice to have two levels of clean boost"}
{"source": "The next annoyance is the very limited capabilities of the optional footswitches"}
{"source": "  I was hoping to be able to flip between the preset and manual setting, but all it does is turn the preamp on and off, or step (one way) through the presents (FS-5U)"}
{"source": "It almost appears that Boss very cynically crippled the ME70 so it did not threaten GT10 sales"}
{"source": "I'm looking forward to learning more about this pedal"}
{"source": "  So far, it does some good things, but it could be much better"}
{"source": "Has anyone else noticed the ME70 reviews out there aren't too useful?  I'm thinking of checking out the Vox Tonelab EX, which is being blown out now"}
{"source": "  $225 at GC, for example"}
{"source": "--3/16/12 update:  Despite the limitations above, I like the portability of this unit"}
{"source": "  It runs on 6 AA's (I think) which is great when you just want to put it on the floor and play, for example at a jam where you don't have power nearby"}
{"source": "New Fail update - the Tremolo in this unit just stinks"}
{"source": "  I mean stinks"}
{"source": "  Whatever the \"waveform\" is, it's not a sine wave, not smooth at all"}
{"source": "  Very poor musical characterists"}

{"source": "  It's a condenser mic, and doesn't filter out ambient noise as well as I'd like, however for an under forty dollar purchase - I'm still very happy with it"}
{"source": " Cakewalk never has registered correctly with my system so I uninstalled it"}
{"source": "  I guess if anything, that's been the downside to this purchase"}
{"source": "For 30 bucks this mic is great! I have garage band and needed a mic for voice and room recording, well this mic does it and them some"}
{"source": " The different modes are distinct and perfect from podcast to vocals and for room jams "}
{"source": " It comes with a long cable, rotating bad, and a nice carry case that fits in my pocket"}
{"source": " BUY this mic, for 30bucks you will,be surprised"}
{"source": "The mic does exactly what I wanted it to do"}
{"source": "  The mic has a headphone jack"}
{"source": "  Having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings"}
{"source": " Also, I like having the two polar patterns, switchable from cardioid to omni"}
{"source": "I did have to back off a bit in proximity to the mic, as my voice is powerful"}
{"source": "  Once, I got the hang of it I had no problems"}
{"source": "I did find the bundled Cakewalk software useless"}

{"source": "com"}
{"source": "  It works great with my new \"Acoustica Mixcraft 5 Audio MIDI Music Recording Software V 5"}
{"source": "\"Overall, this is an awesome product"}
{"source": "Having misplaced my Blue Snowflake USB mic, I decided to give this recently introduced, competitively priced USB mic from Samson a try"}
{"source": "  (Samson is maker of the highly popular and effective Zoom personal digital recorders--the H2 and the H4n"}
{"source": ")  It's an attractive, fully outfitted piece of equipment, with handsome packaging (a small black box and zippered carrying case with aesthetics apparently inspired by iPod)"}
{"source": "  It's smaller and lighter than the Snowflake--more diminutive than the picture would suggest"}
{"source": "  Yet the audio quality strikes me as being somewhat warmer and richer, favoring the bass frequencies of spoken narration more than the Snowflake, which has slightly cleaner and clearer definition at the treble end"}
{"source": "The Samson Go was seen instantly by my iMac, and recording was as advertised: \"Plug n' Play"}
{"source": "\"  The mic is somewhat more sophisticated than the Snowflake in terms of \"latency\" settings (it permits direct monitoring via headphones connected to the mic to insure no delay, or lag time, between transmission and reception), and there's a three-way switch for directional patterns (the manual could be clearer, however, about the difference between \"cardioid\" and \"cardioid 10 pad"}
{"source": "\")  No matter"}
{"source": " The mic performed virtually flawlessly right out of the box, with no tampering with the switch"}
{"source": "It's extremely sensitive, slightly more so than the Snowflake"}
{"source": "  Yet I was unable to avoid the \"P\" popping sounds, regardless of how close I got to the mic and muted my consonants"}
{"source": "  So be prepared for the addition of some sort of \"pop filter\" device (either one sold on Amazon or a self-designed one, using a nylon stocking)"}
{"source": "The mic can be clipped to the top of a computer screen or mounted on a mic stand (using a supplied adapter or ordering a properly sized one from Samson)"}
{"source": "  Yet with its heavy base plus the flexible, tilting mic, it can be placed on a flat surface--much like the Snowflake, but with greater stability and without any intrusive cable"}
{"source": "  (The Snowflake tends to \"flop around,\" requiring some balancing of the device by the user"}
{"source": ")My biggest disappointment thus far is that the clip, as alluded to by another reviewer, does not open far enough for attachment to a desk-top computer (it should be an ideal fit with most notebook machines)"}
{"source": "  Although the Snowflake doesn't use a spring clip, it suffers from the same limitation"}
{"source": "  If you're especially concerned about durability, the Snowflake appears to be the heavier, more rugged mic, with thick metal and no tiny switches or spring clips to wear out"}
{"source": "  The Samson is the more delicate and refined of the two"}
{"source": "  But don't kid yourself"}
{"source": "  Either mic will exceed the capabilities of your computer's built-in mic and perhaps the owner's expectations"}
{"source": " On the other hand, neither is a match for the Shure SM7B that I'm accustomed to using at a local broadcasting studio"}
{"source": "  Still, Samson would appear to have a winner with this little wonder, whether it's used in conjunction with a computer to record full-frequencied music or \"realistic\"-sounding narration"}
{"source": "I really wanted this to be a great product"}
{"source": "  The screws strip out too easily"}
{"source": "  Basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out"}
{"source": "  I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon"}
{"source": "  Nope"}
{"source": "  Even the pop filter fell off"}
{"source": "  I LOVE the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage"}
{"source": " ex:  adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc"}
{"source": "  Otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option"}
{"source": "  Just make it one solid piece"}
{"source": "  I'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design"}
{"source": "  It's just not strong enough"}
{"source": "  Not that it's a surprise though"}
{"source": "  Not much of anything is worth the money these days"}
{"source": "  It's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products"}
{"source": "  Why should they?  They already have your money"}
{"source": "  I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up"}
{"source": "  Besides, what are they going to do?  Replace it with another broke a$$ product?  Better yet, refund my money for the product I paid - minus shipping????  That doesn't include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place"}
{"source": "  I want a refund, plus an hourly wage"}
{"source": "  Whatever, don't buy one"}
{"source": "  Companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business"}
{"source": "  What would make me happy, is for one of these companies that make these products to answer the question(s):  Did you test this product?  How did you test it?  What were your results?  Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?Nope"}
{"source": "I'm loving this pop filter! It looks professional in design, and feels very sturdy on the mic stand"}
{"source": " The built in shock mount is definitely a plus"}
{"source": " I like it because some beginners try to grab the mic in the studio when recording vocals"}
{"source": " This immediately let's them know to just speak into the microphone"}
{"source": " Also offers the option of removing the pop screen if you want"}
{"source": " Amazon was great in conjunction with the seller! My item arrived lightning fast! Amazon is like music to my ears, and that's why their products are in my studio"}
{"source": " Simply THE BOMB!!!!!"}
{"source": "I got these for the build in Pop Screen"}
{"source": " However I found it can only be attached in one place"}
{"source": " This is ok if you are using a full boom that&#8217;s facing the singer"}
{"source": " But if you are working in a tight space and the boom stand is to the side of the singer , this presents difficulties"}
{"source": " It fits my MXL mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem"}
{"source": "As soon as I attached my mic, and with my strong hands, I over twisted the mic holder on the threads, and the thread piece came loose on the stand"}
{"source": "  I think I can fix it with some liquid metal, but this is not as impressive as some mic stands I've had in the past"}
{"source": "  Sincerely, DocAfter a few months of trying to make it work"}
{"source": "  It doesn't"}
{"source": "  I changed my rating from 3 to 1  This puppy is just poor quality"}
{"source": "I have three mic stands, with this one being the fourth"}
{"source": " I STILL have three mic stands because this one was absolutely horrible"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " The top mount would rarely stay fixed and kept dipping down"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " The bottom clamp never did secure properly"}
{"source": " It kept opening up even without a mic on it"}
{"source": " The weight of the stand itself stripped it"}
{"source": "I sent it back without hesitation"}
{"source": "I've owned a lot of cables over the years, and most have been junk"}
{"source": "  For the money, there is no better instrument cable out there than the Spectraflex"}
{"source": "  I've regularly rolled 100-pound half stacks over them, jumped up and down on them, and tossed them in the back of a truck with all manner of jagged and unholy acoutrements, and they stay clean and work like the first day"}
{"source": "Pros:- Proper shielding means this is a quiet, accurate cable- Slick braided covering makes it super easy to untangle- Very flexible- Metal sleeves enable easy repairs should the unthinkable happen- Available in some very cool colors- Lifetime warrantyCons:- None to speak of"}
{"source": "Spend a little extra money and get the best value cable on the market today"}
{"source": "  A lifetime warranty means you'll have it forever"}
{"source": "I have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly"}
{"source": " What I love is they do not introduce noise in the signal path, and have some nice touches in the way they are made"}
{"source": "One of those 'nice touches' is a strain relief at both ends, which will prolong the life of the cable as well as prevent micro breaks in the conductor that can (and will) introduce noise and static eventually"}
{"source": " The plugs are also of the highest quality"}
{"source": " They mate perfectly with 1/4\" receptacles on guitars and amps"}
{"source": "I mentioned that these are for inside playing"}
{"source": " What I mean is for outside gigs on rough concrete, cobblestone and similar surfaces the outer jacket will fray as the cable is dragged across the surface"}
{"source": " That is not a negative aspect of the jacket as much as a reality of the material from which the jacket is made"}
{"source": "Otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality, price and performance"}
{"source": " Get one as a spare if for no other reason because I think you will be pleased with it"}
{"source": "I use the 21' cable"}
{"source": " Great build quality, looks professional, sturdy plugs, and most importantly it sounds great! I like the smooth fabric sleeve, it doesn't stick to things like a plastic/rubber cable can"}
{"source": "This is my first fatso-flex cable"}
{"source": "  I think I've had Spectraflex cables before, and they've been fine, but I've owned, lost, lent, etc"}
{"source": " so many over the years I can't recall"}
{"source": "  The look and feel of this cable is excellent"}
{"source": "  Seems very solid, but it's always difficult to tell with cables"}
{"source": "  I like the flexibility much better than my Monster cable, which is much stiffer and tends to want to coil back onto itself"}
{"source": "  The fatso is nice and flexible, and it looks fantastic"}
{"source": "  It sounds fine, no issues"}
{"source": "  I'm not one of those who believes all the snakeoil about high-end cables being necessary"}
{"source": "  Get something decent that isn't noisy, and the tone comes from you and your equipment"}
{"source": "  No issues in that regard with the fatso"}
{"source": "One last thing - you've gotta love Amazon"}
{"source": "  I got a 10' red and a 14' violet for ~$15 each, while other colors in the same lengths were twice the price or more"}
{"source": "  So, I wasn't choosey about the colors I got"}
{"source": "  THey look great, though"}
{"source": "  Oh, and one thing I'm a bit iffy about is Spectraflex's lifetime warranty"}
{"source": "  The fine print requires a sales receipt (BS IMO) and says something to the affect of \"we will decide if we will replace it\""}
{"source": "  So, way what you will about Monster, but they'll replace anything with no receipt, which is more reasonable, I think"}
{"source": "  But I'll worry about that when it's time to worry about it, but it's worth considering, as the return process might not be exactly hassle-free"}
{"source": "This is one great looking cable"}
{"source": " I purchased this cable December 2010 and it is still working well and stilllooks good"}
{"source": " And as Fernando Lamas says, \"it is better to look good than to feel good\""}
{"source": " Well, not when itcomes to cables"}
{"source": "This cable is 20 AWG, with an \"Ultra-Pure Copper Center Conductor\" and 100% copper and conductivepolymer shield"}
{"source": " You want a good shield if you are going to be playing loud"}
{"source": " Helps keep those ugly micro-phonics away and you want that big time"}
{"source": "The capacitance of this cable according to the manufacturer is 39 pF/ft"}
{"source": " This is the one spec you wantto pay attention to when buying instrument cables"}
{"source": " The lower the number, the least resistance whichresults in a higher performing cable"}
{"source": "Out of this cable expect a more corpulent sound and beefy output"}
{"source": " It seems the lows and mids are hugeand the highs are very nice indeed"}
{"source": " This seems to be a very nicely balanced cable for the money"}
{"source": "This cable comes in other colors in the braided cover style"}
{"source": " They look terrific but I find this \"Fatso\" muchharder to coil than the thinner Spectraflex 'Vintage' this company makes"}
{"source": " The bulkiness of this cabledoesn't seem to lend itself to easy coiling"}
{"source": " It also seems to become twisted a lot easier and thus harderto straighten out and coil for storage"}
{"source": " The easiest of my cables to coil, by the way, is the Lava Cable,\"Magma\", which only has a black rubber jacket and is a dream to coil"}
{"source": " If I were to need more cable, quitehonestly I would buy the Lava"}
{"source": " Pretty doesn't count for much with me"}
{"source": "I gave this cable 4 stars because of its very good sound, is well constructed, has excellent shrunk rubbercovering the plugs, looks darn marvelous, and has about average specs for the money"}
{"source": " Yet, difficulty incoiling for storage makes it a bit of a pain in the arse to deal with on a nightly basis"}
{"source": "If you want a beautiful, well made cable that you don't have to put away every day buy this one"}
{"source": "This is my first experience with a \"high end\" guitar cord after playing for longer than I'd like to admit"}
{"source": "  For many years i've been playing with any old shielded solid core cord without regard for much besides price"}
{"source": "  In prep for an upcoming gig, I bought 2 Spectraflex Fatso 18' right angle cords"}
{"source": "  I find them to be very well made, with shrink tubing sealed strain reliefs at the high quality plugs, thick and heavy duty cabling (but not too think nor too heavy), and best of all, very quiet, presumably because of superior shielding"}
{"source": "  They were what I consider expensive (about $38 each), but for me, well worth the price, and considerably less than many other high end cables I found and read about"}
{"source": "  I imagine that they will last for years"}
{"source": "  I think I will eventually replace all my dozen or so cords of various lengths with these"}
{"source": "J"}
{"source": "M"}
{"source": " Tepper"}
{"source": "I know the kind of person I am - If I buy a big pedal board, I'll have to spend hundreds of dollars to fill it up with great effects"}
{"source": " Buy a smaller board and I can be selective in the pedals I buy and save $$ by not trying to fill it"}
{"source": " Hence, the purchase of the Pedaltrain Mini"}
{"source": "This board will fit approx 5 pedals and a power supply"}
{"source": " When I initially purchased it, I was hoping that I could fit the power supply under the board, but I tried a few small power units from Guitar Center and none would fit and allow the board to lay flush"}
{"source": " I should probably ding one star for this and it would be a great improvement if pedaltrain would just raise the board about 1/8\" to allow for the power to be mounted under the board"}
{"source": "The unit is VERY sturdy and ships with velcro to secure pedals to the top"}
{"source": " The velcro feels like it's military grade and does a great job of securing the pedals"}
{"source": " It's light, easy to carry, and I can grab the case in one hand, with my guitar in the same hand, and carry my amp with the other hand (only one trip from the car to the gig)"}
{"source": "Overall, this is a great board"}
{"source": " I currently have a looper, overdrive, distortion, echo and tuner on my unit"}
{"source": " I've added a photo of my board"}
{"source": "I'm so glad I bought this instead of some of the cheaper, plastic pedalboards out there"}
{"source": "  The board itself is made out of welded metal and it's very sturdy"}
{"source": "  The velcro seems to be of decent quality, too"}
{"source": "  Even the bag is nice"}
{"source": "The single downside of this package is the shoulder strap on the bag"}
{"source": "  As other reviewers have pointed out, the fact that it clips onto the bag in weird places basically makes it worthless"}
{"source": "  My advice is to a) definitely buy the pedal train mini and b) toss the shoulder strap in a drawer somewhere and never look at it again"}
{"source": "I'm using this unit for my bass gear: a SansAmp programmable bass driver DI, a compressor, a tuner"}
{"source": "and possibly an envelope filter at some point"}
{"source": "What a nice product"}
{"source": " Rugged and well made"}
{"source": " The supplied velcro makes it easy to change pedals for various gigs"}
{"source": "I was able to build a pedal board with a tuner, delay, distortion and a two button amp channel switcher with room to spare"}
{"source": " It looks very neat and tidy"}
{"source": " Using George L's makes it look even better"}
{"source": "I will buy one of these again"}

{"source": "For the price, this is a steal"}
{"source": " If you can, snag a pack of new strings and it will sound tremendously better"}
{"source": " All in all with new strings I only spent about $30 on this uke and I think that is more than fair"}
{"source": "If you can't get new strings, the ones that come on it will survive you a little while (but stock strings on any instrument are never great)"}
{"source": " Also, if you don't know how to to tune an instrument/don't have a tuner, you don't need to buy one; if you have a smartphone or iPod touch there are accurate tuning apps for nearly any instrument, ukulele included!A little back story: I used to play instruments when I was younger but stopped in my preteens/early teens"}
{"source": " It's something I've recently been regretting more than ever"}

{"source": " I plan on sticker'ing and painting it anyway :) The gig bag, as other as said, is basically just a dust jacket"}
{"source": " I'm cool with that because that says to me that the majority of the money I spent on this ukulele really was for the ukulele, not the extras!For the price, this ukulele more than serves its purpose"}
{"source": " I was worried that I'd regret not shelling out another $20 or $30 for a more frequently recommended ukelele, but I don't regret it at all"}
{"source": "It's pretty easy to learn, especially if you have the littlest bit of musical knowledge or experience"}
{"source": " Even if you don't, it shouldn't take you too long to be playing some songs! You have the gift of internet where there is information everywhere!This ukelele is perfect for a beginner or for someone who wants a cheap backup or travel option"}

{"source": "  Of the three, I thought that the Mahalo was the best offering both visually and in terms of tone quality"}
{"source": "  The Okina had a poor sound quality even compared to my own 20- and 40-year-old ukuleles (which had the original strings)"}
{"source": "  A string upgrade to Aquila strings helped significantly, but even then, the Okina still had a far worse sound quality at this price level"}
{"source": "The Diamond Head and Mahalo both sounded better even with the stock strings and each includes a very nice (for this price) little gig bag"}
{"source": "  Incidentally, what the Mahalo product description says is a \"color-matching brown gigbag\" ended up being black, but black is pretty standard gig bag color"}
{"source": "  The Mahalo has the most \"island\" look to my eyes and the best sound"}
{"source": "  Much of the sound can probably be attributed to the strings which are more substantial than the Diamond Head's"}
{"source": "  That being said, it still makes financial and practical sense to get the Mahalo since it's so near the same price (compared to the  Diamond Head) and has better strings already installed"}
{"source": "  I've also reviewed the Lanikai and Kala on their own pages"}
{"source": "I doubt you can beat this for $25! The uke is a solid little guy"}
{"source": "  I shimmed the bridge a little because I can play hard, but it wasn't bad"}
{"source": " Pretty well in tune up the neck"}
{"source": "  Strings are ok but I do have some Aquilas to put on; will see if it matters much"}
{"source": "The tuners ARE geared, not friction like in the one picture --- at least, mine are"}
{"source": "The carrying bag is just that, with no padding or other protection, but keeps the rain off"}
{"source": "I've owned several multi-effect pedals in the past, even one Digitech"}
{"source": "  Up til now, they all had one thing in common: layers of menus to click thru to make any changes or adjustments"}
{"source": "  It was a pain"}
{"source": "  Then I saw this one"}
{"source": "with KNOBS! I did a lot of research, and was torn between the RP255 and the RP355"}
{"source": " I decided to go cheap and got the RP255"}
{"source": "  So far, that was an OK decision"}
{"source": "  The RP255 has plenty of features, and is a good compromise between menus and knobs"}
{"source": "  I recommend reviewing the manual for your first day or two of orientation"}
{"source": "To sum up the device quickly, the RP255 is probably capable of generating any sound or effect you want, but you may need to work at it"}
{"source": "  As with many multi-effect pedals, there is a selection of (60) factory tone/effect profiles, to save you the trouble of programming new ones"}
{"source": "  These are mirrored by 60 \"user-defined\" profiles, which are identical to the factory presets"}
{"source": "  The difference is that #1-60, can be modified by the user, or left as-is"}
{"source": "  The factory presets, # 61-120, are not modifiable"}
{"source": "  So, you can really experiment with different setups without worrying about losing what came from the factory"}
{"source": "  You can also \"reset\" the entire device if you want to, but if you do you will lose all of your modifications"}
{"source": "In addition to all the different tones and effects this unit has to offer, there are also two additional features which are very useful: a (pretty basic)drum machine and a 20 second looper"}
{"source": "  The looper is really why I bought this pedal"}
{"source": "  It's easy to use, and it overdubs"}
{"source": "  I only wish Digitech would have made it a 40 or 60 second looper"}
{"source": "  20 seconds really isn't much"}
{"source": "  FYI, you cannot use the drummer and the looper at the same time"}
{"source": "  No biggie for me"}
{"source": "OK, all that's good, so why am I disappointed in this unit?  Pretty simple"}
{"source": "  I'm an older guy, who has been playing for approximately 50 years"}
{"source": "  I've played every kind of music there is, and I would have appreciated a much broader selection of presets"}
{"source": "  This may be a slight exageration, but it seems like 95% of the presets are some sort of (obnoxious) distortion"}
{"source": "  Come on guys, not all of your customers are 13 years old!  I expect a professional piece of equipment to offer a variety of professional choices"}
{"source": "  Now, I'm faced with working out all of my own presets"}
{"source": "  I'm back to programming menus again, ugh!"}
{"source": "So that's about it"}
{"source": "  It's a solid piece of equipment, with too many juvenile tone presets to choose from"}
{"source": "  In all honesty, if I had been aware of this, I would have probably not gotten this unit, inspite of its good design and quality"}
{"source": "For $120 you get virtually every effect in the book"}
{"source": "ProsTuner works wellAbility to adjust presets on the computerClean sounds are great - especially the reverb"}
{"source": " When spring reverb is used with the '65 Fender Twin amp model you can get a really great sounding drip, much better than you'd expect"}
{"source": " Delay and chorus are also pretty good"}
{"source": "Downloadable presets on the internetConsDistortions and overdrives are pretty meh"}
{"source": " Nothing as good as even a DS-1 pedal"}
{"source": " Nothing in the same league as a good solid state amp overdrive"}
{"source": " And nothing in the same universe as a good tube overdrive"}
{"source": "No permanent preset"}
{"source": " In other words, it'd be great to have a clean channel that you could double tap to from any other preset"}
{"source": " No dice, so you have to program the same sound into multiple preset slots"}
{"source": " That makes what seems like a lot (60 slots) get filled up pretty fast"}
{"source": "In the end, it's definitely worth the $120 I spent on it"}
{"source": " I recommend this if you're in the market for one"}
{"source": "Not the best pedal out there, but for the price"}
{"source": "it's pretty freakin' awesome!  Love the 20 second looper and the ability to turn wah on and off by depressing the volume pedal all the way forward"}
{"source": "  Solid sounds and cabinets!"}
{"source": "I gave it two stars because the expression pedal stopped working after the second day , and visually it's hard to read because the lettering is so small"}
{"source": " Also there are  many function for one knob to have, a little confusion for me"}
{"source": " The sounds are great and the recording aspect of it is nice, but not something that is best for my needs"}
{"source": "I am looking into a Boss ME-25 instead,"}
{"source": "Unit is sturdy"}
{"source": " Lots of good presets and capabilities"}
{"source": " Works with down-loadable X-Edit software"}
{"source": " That gets confusing a bit because the unit displays one thing, the computer screen another"}
{"source": " I haven't mastered it yet and after a month am just knocking about and settling on sounds that are acceptable but far from ideal"}
{"source": " I've see much easier software that puts all effects on screen as stomp box graphics and you build a sound"}
{"source": " With the X-Edit you call up a canned sound and start changing it"}
{"source": " The interface does not match the RP 255 and has a lot more provisions"}
{"source": " The thing is, they get to be a bit overwhelming, at least to me"}
{"source": " I got this for Christmas and would shop around a lot more"}
{"source": " Perhaps I wind up choosing this but so far, eh"}
{"source": " For one thing, plugging headphones into it, the output isn't as loud as I'd like"}
{"source": " I kinda demands output to another device/mixer/amp if you want to play loud"}
{"source": "I used to buy a lot of wire form these guys"}
{"source": " However, you need to be careful and test everything you get from them on an XLR cable tester"}
{"source": "I didn't believe it myself"}
{"source": "I read another reviewer had an issue with XLR cables being wired incorrectly from pin to pin"}
{"source": " So I took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables"}
{"source": "I got through only 4 monoprice cables before I found one that was miss-wired"}
{"source": " Now I will be checking all of them for sure"}
{"source": "Not a good start though"}
{"source": "Glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on"}
{"source": "I suggest everyone check their monorpice cables"}
{"source": " The testers are very cheap and may show problems you weren't aware of"}
{"source": "I use these cables in my home, hooked up from my audio interface to my monitors"}
{"source": " They appear to be very well built and sound just fine"}
{"source": " I have had them for several months and they are working perfectly"}
{"source": " Highly recommended for the price"}
{"source": "The coversion cable didnt work"}
{"source": " t is  axlr to UBS cable"}
{"source": " I have the red  blinking light syndrome also"}
{"source": " But I learned awhile back dont try to fix something you paid for Send it back"}
{"source": " So izm Thanks HDE for wasting my time"}
{"source": " Go sell your snake oil to someone else"}
{"source": "I wanted to use these cables for my acoustic/electric guitar"}
{"source": "  They are a little short for that appicaton (my fault though)"}
{"source": "  They seem to be built well but I'd say in comparison to other cables I've used for my applicaiton, the sound is average"}
{"source": "  These will work in many applications and might be satisfactory to most"}
{"source": "  If you are a performing musician, you would do better to look at higher quality cables for best sound quality and lowest noise"}
{"source": "I use this small stand in my vocal isolation booth to hold the iPad that remotely controls my audio software via the Splashtop app"}
{"source": " Very secure, effective clamp that connects to a vertical pipe"}
{"source": " I covered with thin carpet to reduce reflection, and I find that it holds my iPad securely"}
{"source": " I highly recommend"}
{"source": "I use this for my iPad"}
{"source": "  I drilled bigger holes to lighten it up a bit"}
{"source": " It's solid and works great, very adjustable"}
{"source": " Good seller to"}
{"source": "I ordered two of these, one to hold music, and one to hold a netbook computer"}
{"source": " I am very happy with how it performs in both situations"}
{"source": " High quality, solid support, and good design decisions all around"}
{"source": " The angle adjustment is very solid and it should be able to hold a very heavy book of music or a medium sized computer"}
{"source": "The arm is just long enough that if turn the platform sideways, you can lean the music stand back next to the mic stand that it is attached to"}
{"source": " I will try to add pictures when I get a chance"}
{"source": "This is really two products that work together: a short boom arm with a mic attachment, and a narrow music stand that mounts onto a standard microphone thread base"}
{"source": " I am using one stand attached to a mic stand, and a second with the arm removed, mounted directly onto a &#34;Gibraltar Multi-Mount Microphone Clamp&#34;"}
{"source": " Major bonus points for making a solid piece of gear that is also modular and flexible"}
{"source": "Note: the music stand easily detaches from the adjustable-angle part for storage"}
{"source": " This is great, but be aware that the lock nut does not do a good job of &#34;locking&#34;, so if you turn the stand upside down, the it will fall off"}
{"source": " This could be a problem if you experience frequent random gravity fluctuations"}
{"source": "Final verdict: I own two, and am considering buying one of the full-width (MUS-ARM 2) models also"}
{"source": "This gig bag was just what I needed to carry around a soprano ukelele"}
{"source": " It has a strap for slinging the instrument over your shoulder when in the gig bag, padding, and a pocket in the front for your tuner"}
{"source": "  The zipper is strong enough and it was just what I needed to carry around the ukelele to keep it protected while in transit"}
{"source": "If you are looking for a good quality inexpensive case, this is a very good choice"}
{"source": "  It has a durable feel to it"}
{"source": " It has a handle and a removable strap as well as a zippered slot on the outside for accessories"}
{"source": "  It works very well"}
{"source": "I ordered this product to review for possible use by members of my senior adult choir at church"}
{"source": "  It was ordered with a little trepidation after reading some of the previous reviews"}
{"source": "  I found it to be excellent for the price and so far, have had no problems with the zippers"}
{"source": "This product is described as a \"Soprano Ukulele Gig Bag\" and that is exactly what it is"}
{"source": "  A \"gig bag\" is *not* a rigid FAA-approved flight case, nor is it a semi-rigid polystyrene \"case\" with soft covering"}
{"source": "  Reviewers that don't believe this is sufficiently padded are looking for something other than a \"gig bag\" and don't understand the term"}
{"source": "  You wouldn't put your reading glasses in a soft, padded case and expect to be able to sit on them would you?I don't know if some other reviewers tried to fit concert-sized ukuleles or other larger sizes into this bag, but I found that it fits the soprano size perfectly"}
{"source": "  It is *very well padded* for a gig bag, having extra padding at the base of the instrument (where the bottom strap button would be if you have one) to cushion the bottom if you hold it standing on end"}
{"source": "  It also has a nicely padded handle"}
{"source": "  I received it in a box with other items and it was packaged well"}
{"source": "  (Ukulele not included"}
{"source": "  They cost a little more than this"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "This is a great padded case that fits my soprano uke just right"}
{"source": "  I like to ride my bike and take my uke along"}
{"source": " The small size means it fits my panniers just fine"}
{"source": "  The thick padding protects the uke from bumps and scrapes"}
{"source": "  The larger foam/nylon cases are nice and offer more robust protection but they don't fit into a shopping bag or backpack nearly as well"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended for the adventurous uke player"}
{"source": "This bag was nicer than I expected for the price"}
{"source": " Considering that many soprano ukuleles are in the $20 t0 $100 range, a lot of people won't want to buy a hard case for three times the price of this gig bag or for more money than their instrument cost"}
{"source": "The case is better padded than I might have expected for the price"}
{"source": " Since soprano ukuleles are small and lightweight instruments, it's not clear to me why a hard case would be as important to most people as it might be to somebody evaluating guitar cases, or cases for other larger instruments"}
{"source": "If you have a small child who is likely to sit on the instrument or drop it down the stairs constantly, you might want to consider something better"}
{"source": " But this should provide adequate protection in general, even from minor falls"}
{"source": " For a soft bag, this offers all I would ever need"}
{"source": "I use 2 to stereo mic my egnater, works great, nice sound, to my ears not much different from an SM-57 and is a fraction of the price"}
{"source": " It's not an audio professionals mic but good enough for me! Too noisy for hand held vocals, put it a mic stand instead"}
{"source": "I've been using Shure microphones live and in the studio for nearly thirty years now and I can honestly say that I can hear no audible differences between a genuine Shure SM-57 and this GLS Audio ES-57"}
{"source": "This isn't based on any scientific data, it's based on A/B'ing this mic and a Shure 57 on the same tube amp at the same volume and distance going through the same mic pre"}
{"source": " I made sure that I marked the exact location of the mic with a little masking tape on the amp's speaker grill"}
{"source": " I recorded about 30 seconds of the same simple chord progression first with the Shure mic, and then this one"}
{"source": " When you play them back either through studio monitors or some very good Bose headphones you can hear no audible difference between the two"}
{"source": " If you were to examine the tracks in a waveform editor I'm sure you'll see some visual differences (but they are also two different performances), but my ears really hear nothing audibly different"}
{"source": " Some may disagree, but I'm convinced"}
{"source": "This mic is built solidly and weighs the same as the Shure and for all intents and purposes looks almost identical both inside and out"}
{"source": "Is it as good as the Shure? I don't know, I think so - others may not"}
{"source": " I do know that you can buy three of these for the price of one Shure 57 though"}
{"source": " I'd highly recommend these on guitar cabinets, snare drums, and toms for sure, maybe vocals in a pinch on a particular type of voice"}
{"source": "A no-brainer as far as I can tell"}
{"source": "Excellent tuner"}
{"source": "  I appreciate it's compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock"}
{"source": "  It performs as it should and appears to be quite durable"}
{"source": "  Being able to angle the unit is great"}
{"source": "  The back light works well in dim light and of course the piezo mode makes tuning in noisey invironments quite easy"}
{"source": "  They do mean it when they say to replace the battery when you get it"}
{"source": "  Mine lasted for a couple of weeks"}
{"source": "  It was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront"}
{"source": "  All in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly"}
{"source": "I bought this for a friend who always wanted to play violin but never could afford one, the quality was surprisingly good considering how cheap it was, I helped her set it up (took 15 minutes max, just needed to get the bridge just right) and the only flaw I found was the horrible pegs that came with it, I had some spare rosewood ones in a drawer which fixed that small problem, as for the rest of the violin the furniture was workmanlike, not concert quality but serviceable for a student, the body was what really surprised me, for a mass produced student model it has a nice sound, I do believe that with nicer furniture, a better bridge, and strings I would not be ashamed to play this at a venue, how it will hold up over time is a open question but from what I can see of its internals it is well put together"}
{"source": "this brings me to my only real problem, as she never has played any instrument at all she makes this violin squeal like a pig, I am no good at teaching so I got her a few books and downloaded some vids from youtube for her to watch but still"}
{"source": "Her husband has forbidden her to bring the violin home till she can play so she comes over here to practice, which has led my neighbors to believe I am responsible for the sudden disappearance of several neighborhood cats (I think the noise chased em away) I am waiting for the call from the SPCA as I type this"}
{"source": "I bought this just to see if I might enjoy learning or if my shoulders (I'm gettin' old"}
{"source": "lol)would allow me to hold the correct position long enough to practice"}
{"source": "  I wouldn't say it's agreat instrument but WAY more than I expected for $60"}
{"source": "  After I changed the strings,(I used the extra set that came with it) it actually produced decent sound"}

{"source": "no muss, no fuss!  For the money, I don't think you can find a better deal for enhancing your PC's audio versatility"}

{"source": "I own three of these units (one Red 222 and two Grey 202)and use them to output midi sounds from my laptops internal sound moduals to a pro PA system (mostly Mackie gear) for live performance and occasionally to add sounds to recordings in my 24 track home studio"}
{"source": " This unit is quiet and very handy"}
{"source": " The price is dead cheap"}
{"source": " I have two other similar units (a Lexicon Alpha and the smaller Lexicon Omega boxes)that cost much more"}
{"source": " Yes my Lexicon boxes provide a lot of different inputs and outputs and are very nice but if all you need is a very portable basic input/output sound card that is very quiet and easy to install (just plug it), you should buy this box"}
{"source": "Some of the reviews talk about it being \"cheap\" plastic"}
{"source": " Yes it is plastic (so are many other more expensive units) but I have been throwing these boxes in with my other equipment and have yet to break one of them or have any problems"}
{"source": " I will also admit that while I don't abuse my equipment on purpose, I am not that gentle either and have dropped these several times with no damage"}

{"source": " This is high quality studio software that you can still download and use for free and it's not a trial software that will expire in 30 days or block out important features"}
{"source": " I would add that to really make it work well you need to use the preferences section to set it up to the higher quality settings that are available"}
{"source": " As I remember the defaults are set at mid level quality so the average home user can use it without taxing their computer resources"}
{"source": "The bottom line is that both Behringer units (202 and 222) both work great and I can't hear or see any difference in them other than the color and the added software included with the 222 package"}

{"source": "Some say \"this capo work bad\" I have to ask \"are your guitar is good enough to use this capo?\" or \"are you know how to use capo?\"I'm more than 20 years of playing guitar"}
{"source": " This capo is worth the price"}
{"source": " Good quality and work great for not extream user (Are you nuts?)"}
{"source": " Best recomended quality and price"}
{"source": " PS"}
{"source": " May not for very big guitar neck! Enjoy!"}
{"source": "In my opinion"}
{"source": "This is the best amp in this category"}
{"source": " I know people who have the Marshall and the Fender"}
{"source": " I plugged into my little HoneyTone and I had the best sounding micro amp hands down"}
{"source": " They were both amazed with the sound"}
{"source": " They said \"well mine was only $45 and \"mine was only $40"}
{"source": "\" Too bad so sad for them"}
{"source": " I told them mine was $20"}
{"source": " Since it doesn't say Marshall or Fender, I only had to pay 1/2 for a better sounding amp"}
{"source": " If you are looking for an amp with 1 or 2 watts, and know what to expect from a micro, this amp does not disappoint"}
{"source": "The HoneyTone is aptly named"}
{"source": "  It has a long reputation for having excellent sound for its size"}
{"source": " That reputation is earned"}
{"source": "  It has double the volume of a portable amp I own that's twice its size"}
{"source": "  The tone range is generous (from mellow to high treble)"}
{"source": "  From what I've seen and heard, the &#34;overdrive&#34; function is fairly useless in an amp this size"}
{"source": "  It tends to go distortion to the point of garble"}
{"source": "  My guess is specific guitars may work well with the overdrive, but I have no use for it as I prefer clear tones"}
{"source": "  It is possible to over-volume the amp (as with any amp) so i don't max it out, but for a portable or practice amp, it works very well"}
{"source": "  I've bought three of these now and plan to buy more"}
{"source": "  I don't know as I'd pay $40 to $60 for it, but the Amazon price (currently around $20) makes it a great value"}
{"source": "  I hope it's around at this price level for a long time as it's great for hobbyist projects or for box guitar amping"}
{"source": "I bought 4 pcs of these at $8each shipped"}
{"source": " These are very well constructed and function very well too"}
{"source": " I am using these to tap the INSERTS from my mixer and send the signal to my M-audio Fast Track ultra for recording"}
{"source": " By putting the 1/4\" TS partially in to the INSERT of my mixer (and most mixers) you can get a direct output without actually interupting the signal chain"}
{"source": " The other end of the 1/4\" TS cable goes to the PDC21 and then I use the XLR output to connect to my Fast Track using either and XLR to XLR or and XLR to TRS cable"}
{"source": " My Fast Track did not like something about the signal level when I fed it directly from the mixer but with the PDC21 between the mixer and FTU, it works fantastic"}
{"source": " This is for refernce recording in our jam-space, not studio recording; it works great for this application"}
{"source": "I have also used this as a DI box for guitar, all of my gear is middle of the line (not junk but not super high-end), I don't notice any tone-sucking in my \"jam-space\" application"}
{"source": "I would definately buy more"}
{"source": "Tested by the guitar mags to be the best strap lock available"}
{"source": "  These are basically the same as Schaller strap locks"}
{"source": "  They cost less money and I think the parts are interchangeable"}
{"source": "  It is still best to keep them seperated as to their original manufacturer (disclaimer"}
{"source": ")  I know that the Fender buttons will work in the Schaller strap portion of the lock"}
{"source": "Look just like Schaler branded parts without the Schaler brand name stamped on them - there is a little Fender logo on the bottom - real cool"}
{"source": "These strap locks are the greatest - they work perfectly every time and will survive years of on the road abuse"}
{"source": " I have carried an extra set with me in my case in the event that I broke one - but this has never happened"}
{"source": "Touring, bar bands, garage bands or bedroom heroes all need these strap locks on every guitar and strap they own"}
{"source": " And since the guitar isn't hanging by the hole in the strap the strap lasts years longer"}
{"source": "This Behringer box is a very good tool, effect I would recommend to anyone from beginner to pro"}
{"source": " One thing should be noted the light is amber not blue and no 9 volt battery is required"}
{"source": " The device comes with a removable power cord, which  to me is a big plus"}
{"source": "This pedal is \"ok\" by which I mean, I provides the basic functions it says it does"}
{"source": " Quality-wise, it feels a bit cheapish"}
{"source": "I was afraid I was going to snap a pot off or something while playing it"}
{"source": " The case is metal but feels like the thinnest sheet metal they could get away with building it from"}
{"source": " The power switch and chorus/vibrato switch were clearly the cheapest switches they could find, and are not that easily accessible by a toe"}
{"source": "you gotta bend over and flip those"}
{"source": " They are small"}
{"source": "On the other hand it was only sixty-nine-bucks - relatively inexpensive for a multifunction effect pedal"}
{"source": "I don't care for the rear facing upwardly angled input, output and power jacks"}
{"source": " That's not pedal board friendly in my opinion"}
{"source": " Nice as a tabletop effect"}
{"source": " The footprint is fairly huge on the board at about 7"}
{"source": "75\" x 6"}
{"source": "5\" (approx)"}
{"source": " The \"standard\" 9V center negative power supply is a \"postive\" (excuse my pun"}
{"source": ")If you are looking for a way to play with signal modulation - echos, vibratos, reverbs, old style choruses"}
{"source": "this is not a bad way to get started playing with that"}
{"source": " You can make a lot of sounds without breaking the bank"}
{"source": "Personally, I have other effects that make these sounds and do it in a smaller space, so for me"}
{"source": "not a keeper"}
{"source": " Your situation might be different than mine"}
{"source": "Not a bad product, acceptable at it's price point, just didn't impress me much"}
{"source": "When you purchase this product the advertisement leads you to believe a separate power supply is required but it does come with its own power supply"}
{"source": "  There is no need to purchase a separate Behringer PSU-SB"}
{"source": "Otherwise the time machine works fine, as described"}
{"source": "Well 3 hours to put together got tiring and annoying as things tend to fall a part"}
{"source": "however as a standalone items it is great with good sounds and groove tracks to practice drumming on"}
{"source": "However I am not a drummer nor have any interest in becoming one"}
{"source": "I bought this in order to use with software recording for basic beats to fit my own songs"}
{"source": "and it is a NIGHTMAREGoing on a week now no support help from either company"}
{"source": "HEED MY WARNING IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS WITH NI, EZ DRUMMER OR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO REROUTE MAPPING OF MIDI IN ORDER TO USE IT"}
{"source": " This is not a plug and play item you will spend hours of your time trying to get this to work with software"}
{"source": "There is very little helpful info out on the net i've owned this for over a week and still never used it for its purpose yet being that its a stand alone item"}
{"source": "there really is no MIDI support"}
{"source": "Im am close to giving up the fight and sending it back"}
{"source": "Alesis could have made this an amazing item and 1000 times easier if they simply created a midi out port on the module you could run into your daw and software"}
{"source": "Other reviews give an adequate overview of the kit and its potential so I'll just mention particular details: The kick pedal spring tension was set too tight, making the pedal hard to control and very frustrating to a beginner"}
{"source": " Fortunately the thumbscrew and nut adjustment is easy and made a tremendous improvement in feel and control"}
{"source": "The documentation is poor and, inexcusably, there's nothing better available online from Alesis: The steps in the graphical setup page are less than ideal for a single person assembly"}
{"source": " The kit allows for tremendous flexibility in positioning the pads horizontally and vertically, yet you're pretty much left on your own to discover this"}
{"source": " Experienced drummers will know what they want but I would have appreciated a suggested basic setup showing common variations"}
{"source": "The control module's buttons and operation are described but there's no detailed guide to the preset kits or selectable pad patches"}
{"source": " You'll just have to hear them and jot down your own notes"}
{"source": "There seems to be an ongoing controversy over a firmware update to the controller module - whether it fixes an issue with the snare drum pad responsiveness when struck simultaneously with the hi hat, or is in fact the cause of an issue with the pad"}
{"source": " I've noticed no such problem and, as of this date, Alesis has no such update on their site, which leads me to suspect their former patch may have been bad and/or they've updated units currently being sold"}
{"source": "Speaking of the snare, the second outer zone for rimshots is nice but I can only get it to trigger while sticking from the outside"}
{"source": " The technique of laying the stick flat across the head and lifting one end doesn't seem to trigger the rimshot (or perhaps I just haven't worked out the touch yet)"}
{"source": "I'm interested in a natural sound, probably close to a classic jazz kit, and a couple of the presets work for me"}
{"source": " I also have Battery 3 and using the kit to trigger those samples opens up vast possibilities"}
{"source": " Still, most of the time I just want to sit down and play and don't want to bother firing up the PC and loading software so it's nice to have two workable options"}
{"source": " The headphone volume could be louder but running it into powered speakers and taking a headphone out from them solves that issue"}
{"source": "Keeping the pads clean is easy with two soft lint-free cloths"}
{"source": " Dampen one with a little warm water (wring it out well) and use a light circular motion to remove dust and dirt, then wipe gently with the dry cloth to take up any residue"}
{"source": "This is my first experience with an electronic kit and, as others have mentioned, the sensation really is fundamentally different from an acoustic instrument, particularly when striking the cymbal pads"}
{"source": " It takes awhile to mentally balance the soft thud or click (depending on which surface you strike) from outside the headphones with the sampled drum sound within"}
{"source": " I wasn't sure I liked it for the first couple of weeks (meaning I probably didn't) but I've gotten used to it and have gradually begun to relate to the DM6 on its own terms, not as an imitation of an acoustic drum kit, but as something else with its own special characteristics"}
{"source": "For the money it costs it worth it"}
{"source": " The construction seems good (especially the kick drum pedal), but the brains leave a little to be desired, although it's very functional"}
{"source": " The biggest complaint I have is that it only has 1/8&#34; stereo out and 1/8&#34; headphones out"}
{"source": " Really should be 1/4&#34; mono or stereo"}
{"source": " I bought a separate plug to allow this so I could put it into my mixer and I'm good"}
{"source": "I'll try to keep this succinct and say only what needs said"}
{"source": " Setup was fairly easy (although the instructions were downright cryptic)"}
{"source": " The adjustability is wonderful"}
{"source": " And the kit looks phenomenal out of the box"}
{"source": " That being said, one of my toms is nowhere near as responsive as the rest of them (I'll soon contact the company for a replacement), the cymbals are not intuitive to strike placement (you only get the secondary cymbal tone when you strike it very hard, and even then it's no guarantee), and I'm guessing, due to their close proximity to each other and the sensitivity of the pads, the snare often activates when I strike the hi-hat"}
{"source": " At first glance, the different tone kits don't bring much to the table"}
{"source": " But there is a wide range of personalization available when you begin to dig deeper into the controls"}
{"source": " To a small extent, I've even been able to cover up the less-than-responsive tom by lowering the volume on all the other pieces"}
{"source": " My only other complaint is that the bass drum doesn't bring much to the table"}
{"source": " It sounds more like a flat tom than a bass pedal"}
{"source": "In short; this kit was somewhat defective out of the box"}
{"source": " But it's still fun to use"}
{"source": " So, unless you plan to record with your electronic kit, I'd recommend this product as a fun musical toy"}
{"source": " But it's certainly not up to par with some of the more expensive kits I've used"}
{"source": " And recording with this kit would likely be a nightmare"}
{"source": "I am a beginner and wanted a set that I can learn on, but would also allow me to experiment with other percussion instruments besides a rock drum set and would take a small amount of room and allow low volume levels"}
{"source": "  I've had this set for about a month and a half"}
{"source": "  So far, it is working well for me"}
{"source": "  The rubber drum and cymbal surfaces are great for keeping the volume low enough when playing late at night"}
{"source": "  Each drum and cymbal seem to have sweet spots where I imaging the triggers are"}
{"source": "  Depending on the devise, hitting further from this sweet spot might change the sound and/or volume produced"}
{"source": "  The impression I get is that most electronic drum sets have some kind of problem or another, so it seems to be whether the problem(s) are something you can live with or not"}
{"source": "  Also, you can't play with the same nuance and control as an acoustic set, but for the price it goes a long way to making it seem real enough that I can enjoy it and feel like I'm learning the drums"}
{"source": "  It takes up very little space compared to an acoustic set which is great for me since I have little room for it"}
{"source": "  There are a few problems that I'm not likely to encounter until I become really accomplished"}
{"source": "  One is that when playing the snare rim shot and either the hi-hat or tom 1 simultaneously, one or the other will not trigger a sound to occur about half the time"}
{"source": "  I found this out when playing these combinations rapidly, which I'm not likely to do maybe ever"}
{"source": "  But it is still an error in functionality"}
{"source": "  I called Alesis and they said this was a common characteristic of this model drum set"}
{"source": "  There is a firmware update that has been mentioned in earlier reviews that I, but it didn't make any difference"}
{"source": "  In summary, for the price and my needs, I am very pleased with this drum set"}
{"source": "  More expensive sets with more sounds and better nuance control don't have the rubber surfaces that I want, plus, according to reviews they all seem to have problems of some type so spending more money doesn't necessarily eliminate problems"}
{"source": "I bought this for a friend who plays the guitar"}
{"source": " He said that you can hear the guitar but barely"}
{"source": "I bought this to try out on my baritone uke"}
{"source": "It works great and is very easy to use"}
{"source": "I use it with my Fender Mustang"}
{"source": "I had no problem with the suction cup except on the rougher face of my Martin DX1"}
{"source": "I was able to attach it to the smoother HPL back and sides using the suction cup"}
{"source": "I wet it before attaching"}
{"source": "You could also use a small clamp, blue painters tape, etc"}
{"source": ", for trouble mounting"}
{"source": "It could be used on just about any instrument"}
{"source": "  Some may need a clamp"}
{"source": "It picks up anything it is attached to"}
{"source": "It will feed back depending on how close and the angle to the amp"}
{"source": "Pretty cool"}
{"source": "Nice price"}
{"source": "I am not going to say this pickup is the best thing since sliced bread, but it is built solidly and built to last"}
{"source": " It is simple, practical, and cheap"}
{"source": " There are obvious advantages and disadvantages to that"}
{"source": " You don't buy $150"}
{"source": "00 pickup for a $200-$300 instrument"}
{"source": " Being able to plug in and be self-sufficient (in most rooms, especially at open mics) is easier and better than relying on a mic, especially for beginners, because it takes skill and discipline to stay within the mic's sweet spot"}
{"source": " Also, some rooms/PA's/hosts do not work well when trying to mic an instrument"}
{"source": " At least a pickup like this has the potential for keeping the sound front and center"}
{"source": " (I will experiment with different instruments & write more about the quality later"}
{"source": ")That said, there is only one piezo element, unlike a K&K; pickup, for example"}
{"source": " So it is limited in giving you optimal sound, no matter where it is placed"}
{"source": " Also, in case you cannot tell from the image, the soldering connection and wires are exposed on the jack, so it can only be used inside your instrument, which means drilling a hole"}
{"source": "So i decided to amplify my Martin Dreadnaught (a really, really nice acoustic guitar)"}
{"source": " I didn't want to spend a lot if it just wouldn't sound good with a pickup, and saw this had consistently good ratings"}
{"source": " I can't speak for other acoustic pickups, but this far exceeded my expectations, and I don't plan on buying a more expensive piezo, or soundhole pickup"}
{"source": "ATTACHING ITUnfortunately the narrow portion of the barrel is not long enough to fit through the end/tail block; and I didn't want to drill a new hole in my not-so-cheap guitar just to test out a relatively cheap pickup"}
{"source": "So I attached the pickup in the regular position inside the body behind the bridge, and just ran the cable out from the sound hole"}
{"source": " The jack is held onto the pickguard with some scotch outdoor mounting tape (which is kind of like really strong gum, it can be removed without leaving sticky residue); which holds it in place well enough to plug in a cable and move around as long as I don't jerk the guitar quickly"}
{"source": "SOUND QUALITYI plugged it into my cheap, regular guitar amp, and whoa! The package mentions two locations you can place the pickup, and because I needed to run it through the sound hole, I could only place it where more treble is picked up"}
{"source": " So I have to compensate on my amp by turning down the treble to 7 or lowerBecause the pickup is a transducer, no electrical feedback/interference is picked up, so the sound will be very clear and crisp"}
{"source": " It would probably sound even better on an amp with better electric shielding; the only noise I get even at max gain, max input volume, is from the amp itself, heard with every instrument I plug into it if I turn the master volume up too high"}
{"source": "Another thing to consider is that transducers pickup vibrations, so it won't pick up sound when placed a millimeter away from the guitar body, but will when touching it"}
{"source": " So with that in mind, the pickup will strongly output every sound you make to the guitar body; like it brushing up against your body, a zipper hitting the guitar, your fingers sliding on the strings etc"}
{"source": "This pickup is pretty good at lower volumes"}
{"source": " But it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume"}
{"source": " The pickup is very, over sensitive"}
{"source": "Also, spend some time where exactly you place the pickup, it makes a big difference! Try to put it near a solid part of the instrument so it does not pickup so much and make the cound like the bottom of a cave or something"}
{"source": "The Taylor strap is very nice and works like a strap should"}
{"source": " You will notice that it does not slip around once over the shoulder like the nylon cheap straps do"}
{"source": "I bought this strap for my Taylor guitar"}
{"source": "It's a fine strap that feels really comfortable and soft"}
{"source": "As it says, it is made to fit well on Taylor guitars but can fit in any other guitar as well"}
{"source": "The color is pretty much the same as the picture posted"}
{"source": "Highly recommended"}
{"source": "I've been using primarily Alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them"}
{"source": " I figured I'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up"}
{"source": "These were the first to go on, and they were a HUGE step down from what I had on"}
{"source": " The strings I took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string"}
{"source": " They were twice as loud as these"}
{"source": " When you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti"}
{"source": " They don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do"}
{"source": " The cons definitely outweigh the pros here"}
{"source": "Pros:-Very flexible, string bends are easy-Easy on the fingersCons:-The most dull sound of any strings I've ever heard"}
{"source": " Especially on the low end"}
{"source": " They're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound"}
{"source": " The highs are very tinny"}
{"source": " Almost sounds like a bad recording"}
{"source": "-Your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings"}
{"source": " It's the weirdest thing"}
{"source": " This is especially true for the G string"}
{"source": " It's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot"}
{"source": " Anyways, it sucks"}
{"source": " Grip is the last thing you want on your strings"}
{"source": "Bottom line: Unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings, these should not be purchased"}
{"source": " I'll never buy again"}
{"source": " This is the first time in my life I wanted to change brand new strings"}
{"source": "The reason they are called silk and phosphor is that the wound strings have silk along with steel in their cores (the wire around which the windings are wound) rather than just steel"}
{"source": "  This allows them to tune to pitch with less tension, so they can be the ideal string for a beginner or someone who is moving from nylon"}
{"source": "  There are also silk and steel strings with silver plated copper windings"}
{"source": "  The lower tensions and light gauges mean that they may not drive some guitar tops hard enough to let them perform up to their capability"}
{"source": "  That is, they may sound soft and cheap"}
{"source": "  I would not put them on most Martin dreadnoughts, for example"}
{"source": "  But they may work fine on lightly braced guitars"}
{"source": " The only way to find out for sure is to experiment"}
{"source": "These are an experiment for me, I usually use silk-and-steel on my guitar banjo, it was time to change strings, and I stumbled across these"}
{"source": "  I'll have to see where things settle down, but so far I'm willing to give these silk-and-phosphor the nod over silk-and-steel"}
{"source": "  The sound is a bit brighter"}
{"source": "  My music partner says she prefers the way these silk-and-phosphor blend with her fiddle"}
{"source": "This is so \"out there\" that I won't let it influence my rating"}
{"source": "  My guitar-banjo's tailpiece has small holes through which the strings must pass"}
{"source": "  The ends of the windings at the bottoms of the bare steel 1st and 2nd strings stick out a bit, so I had trouble putting them on"}
{"source": "  I was able to use a fine wire cutter to nip the end of the 1st string, but it didn't work for the 2nd string"}
{"source": "  I ended up using a D'Addario string of the same gauge in its place"}
{"source": "  Admittedly, it was a tight fit, but I was able to put it on without working on it"}
{"source": "What's not to love about these strings? The sound is fantastic "}
{"source": " they ring like they should"}
{"source": " But my fret hand no longer gets tired after playing all night long"}
{"source": "These sound and feel good but nothing spectacular to report"}
{"source": "Had to make adjustments to eliminate buzzing"}
{"source": "They sound OK"}
{"source": "I have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar, as that's what I learned on as a child"}
{"source": " I can't afford it at the moment, so I decided to give these a shot"}
{"source": "These do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination"}
{"source": " I didn't expect them to - but a guy can dream, can't he?Anyway, what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overly-bright Takamine"}
{"source": " It also helped with the rather high action"}
{"source": " They play and sound softer"}
{"source": " It's almost like having a new guitar"}
{"source": "During the stringing/stretching process I broke the G string (go easy, they are silk after all) and so had to use a standard bronze replacement"}
{"source": " I asked my non-music oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the 'oddball' string and she got it right on the first try"}
{"source": " that's how much of a difference these strings make"}
{"source": " They sound less 'metallic' - that may sound obvious but my point is that it's a big difference, enough for her untrained ears to hear"}
{"source": "I'm still saving up for a classical, but I really love these strings, and will be using them on my Tak going forward"}
{"source": "These strings are so soft to the touch that they almost feel like \"flat-wound\" acoustic guitar strings"}
{"source": " When you uncoil them out of the wrapper they don't spring out like most other strings but sort of flop out like a string string instead of a wire wrapped in wire"}
{"source": " They sound wonderful but I swear the feel easier to play and I was doing things with them I usually am pretty clumsy at with my mitts"}
{"source": " They won't last as long as coateds of course but they have a depth and a character all their own worth checking out and you may find, like me, that it's worth going back to changing them out every few weeks to get the fresh sound"}
{"source": " If you're really an acoustic guitar aficionado, you'll want to try these"}
{"source": " The almost play themselves IMO"}
{"source": " And that makes me want to play twice as long"}
{"source": "This was a gift for a friend who is a Beatles fan"}
{"source": " I bought him two different types he he liked them both"}
{"source": " These will not be used much"}
{"source": "I just got these to collect not to use to play with"}
{"source": " They look good and anyway planet waves has good stuff"}
{"source": "i'd say these are a pretty neat thing to have in your pick collection"}
{"source": " i don't use them all too often because they're a bit too stiff though"}
{"source": "This is my first noise reducer"}
{"source": " It works and like it says it reduces the noise"}
{"source": " it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch"}
{"source": " The switch let you choose if you want it to reduce the noise when is activated or to mute everything when activated"}
{"source": " The 2 knobs, 1 of them let you select the range of the noise you want to reduce, the other one how fast you want it to start reducing the noise"}
{"source": " I noticed a slight change of the original sound of my distortion, but it could be also because i didn't find the right setup"}
{"source": " if the knob of the noise to reduce is on the highest setting, then it reduce also the sound of the all guitar, so you really gotta study this before you can use it properly"}
{"source": " overall, for the price i'm happy with it, and it hides the hiss and all the other sounds unwanted"}
{"source": "- it's simple to operate- it does what it's made to do- it does that very well- it's bargaintasticIf you know what a noise gate is supposed to do and you think you might need one, then I highly recommend this unit"}
{"source": "I'm about to get a second one and put all my distortion-creating devices in the loop (other Behringer units, Rat, Big Muff, etc etc)"}
{"source": " The one I already have can stay at the end of my signal chain, just before the delays"}
{"source": " Pretty much a must-have for recording, especially during those quiet spots :-) Thanks to this unit I have a very quiet recording setup"}
{"source": "I have a strat running into a crate amp with a tub preamp and it picked up noise like mad"}
{"source": "  this pedal is like an automatic volume knob that turns down the input if there isn't a signal from the guitar"}
{"source": "  takes a little playing with it to get it dialed in, but now I just keep it on all of the time"}
{"source": "havent used it yet"}
{"source": " seems like a nice pedal "}
{"source": " nice an lightweight"}
{"source": " clean"}
{"source": "has some nice rubber on the bottom"}
{"source": " lol haha okaaaaaay?"}
{"source": "I already had two Behringer stompboxes, and am thinking of adding a few more, so I thought rather than having a mess on the stage, I'd get a pedalboard"}
{"source": "  I hadn't really studied them too much, except to note that they all seemed to be way more money than they were worth"}
{"source": "  Then, recently I found this one for less than a hundred bucks, so I really couldn't pass it up"}
{"source": "  I am very impressed with this unit"}
{"source": "  It is well made, well designed, and comes with all sorts of cords and accessories"}
{"source": "  Nothing is lacking to start playing right away"}
{"source": "  I'm not sure how easy other brands stompboxes will fit into this board (you may need to trim the foam that holds them in a little bit), but I think the board should be pretty universal for whatever you have"}
{"source": "  I am not disappointed in the least"}
{"source": "  I think you will like this board"}
{"source": "If you've never had a pedalboard before I'd say pass on this one and look for one that is more user-friendly"}
{"source": "  The pics and description don't show just how insanely large this is"}
{"source": "  It's too big"}
{"source": "  Patch cables are crap and the power supply didn't seem sturdy enough to be kicked around"}
{"source": "Besides this, I had trouble using it (even for practice) because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals"}
{"source": "I ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a Gator 'bone' and a seperate power supply"}
{"source": "  Easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics/cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it's own"}
{"source": "This is a very good investment"}
{"source": " Everything just sits in this case  so I never have to set up any cables again"}
{"source": " All I do is setup the input from guitar to the case, from the case to the amp, and let's not forget the power cable"}
{"source": " It works amazing and saves plenty of time"}
{"source": " I've also seen reviews that it's VERY druable, so you don't have to worry about it breaking easily"}
{"source": " I love the fact that you can hide the wires and also convert the storage bay into space for larger pedals (such as wah or volume)"}
{"source": " The only concern by some people was a slight buzzing"}
{"source": " I replaced the power cable that came with it with one of the power cables that came with one of my pedals, and the sound went away"}
{"source": " I would recomment this to anyone who travels alot, doesn't have a lot of space in their room, or someone who just likes things neat and compact all the time"}
{"source": " This item is VERY convienent!"}
{"source": "Nice thumbpicks for banjo"}
{"source": " They are size large, so if you generally have a very large hand they will be tight on you"}
{"source": " I have a larger hand and they work well, but they are about a micrometer away from being too snug"}
{"source": " But I like them a lot"}
{"source": " Would also work fine with acoustic guitar picking if that's whay you're into (though I always preferred acoustic picking without a thumbpick)"}
{"source": "Others that reviewed this Item I read before purchase, noted it is not &#34;Large&#34; and the picks have to be warmed and shaped to fit your thumb"}
{"source": " I also found in original &#34;Large&#34; size, The curve of the pick will cut into your thumb from improper shaping and being too small for the average American man"}
{"source": " I am still in the process of shaping all 5, but otherwise they appear sturdy and I haven't broken more than one of similar type in several years"}
{"source": " I expect the pick to wear down from use"}
{"source": " They appear to be about the same quality as Indigo brand, but not shaped as well for the average player"}
{"source": "I've used thumb picks for over forty years on a variety of acoustic guitars"}
{"source": "  My thumb nail can't pluck the strings when I damp them with the heel of my hand"}
{"source": "  These are adequate in the sense that you can strike the strings with them and they stay on"}
{"source": "  They have a dullish sound compared to my favorite, the long gone National clear thumb pick or the current Dunlop clear"}
{"source": "  I like the sound of the Ernie Ball thin celluloid picks but they aren't strong enough to grip my thumb"}
{"source": "  The major problem with these is they aren't large"}
{"source": "  They're like most other brands' medium"}
{"source": "  My thumbs aren't Tom Robbins huge, but my hands are bigger than average"}
{"source": "  These picks cut off the circulation in my thumb if I use them for more than fifteen minutes or so"}
{"source": "  I think I could brighten up the sound by sanding them down, but that's a lot of work for something this cheap"}
{"source": "Don't buy these if you have a large thumb"}
{"source": "  If you like a less bright sound, and some people do, and have a medium sized thumb, these might work well for you"}
{"source": "I have an unusually wide and fat thumb, and though tight at first, all of them got comfortable after an hour of playing (each)"}
{"source": " No complaints"}
{"source": "they are nice sometimes but not as comfortable the rest of the time"}
{"source": " they are cheap and do exactly what they are supposed to do"}
{"source": "I did get 5 thumb picks in my order (a previous reviewer mentioned only getting 4), and I always really liked the classic turtle-shell look (far more purty-like than the plain, thick white of Nationals and others)"}
{"source": "  But these are large? And, yes, I double checked the packaging to ensure I was shipped large"}
{"source": " The National mediums I was using before had a looser fit -boggle-"}
{"source": "  But nevertheless, the Planet Waves' far tighter fit actually feel better than the National mediums, which certainly had a clunky sensation; there is probably a small weight difference between the two that would explain the overall feeling of quicker movement while having good solid interactions on the strings"}
{"source": "  All in all, 4 stars"}
{"source": "  Still"}
{"source": " these were a large?  Hate to see how the mediums fit"}
{"source": "V5 = 4 starBugera customer service = -5 starsLets be realistic, this is a very inexpensive tube amp"}
{"source": " Nothing more, nothing less"}
{"source": "Its price reflects exactly what it is, and thats a good thing, and also not so good"}
{"source": "First off, the amp shipped with bad tubes"}
{"source": " (microphonic)Not a big deal, it happens all the time"}
{"source": " But "}
{"source": "Bugera was no help at all, their customer service is by far the worst Ive ever dealt with"}
{"source": "They are clueless, arrogant and condescending"}
{"source": "I bought replacement tubes and solved the issue, but thats not the point"}
{"source": "This experience alone will probably stop me from ever purchasing another Bugera/Behringer product"}
{"source": "Now about the amp itself"}
{"source": "Its ok, at best"}
{"source": " It has no headroom, even on the 5w setting"}
{"source": " I realize a tiny combo wont have much, but this thing has nothing"}
{"source": "It clips far too easily, and forget about running an overdrive pedal into it"}
{"source": " You will only get a muddy, garbled mess"}
{"source": "Clean tones are ok, but dont expect Fender type cleans, they arent there"}
{"source": "Think of Marshall cleans, or even Vox"}
{"source": "The speaker isnt worth the paper its made from"}
{"source": "I plugged the amp into a Celestion 1x12 cab (just for comparison) and it was a whole lot better"}
{"source": "Its built very well, even compared to many amps costing far more"}
{"source": " If youre looking for a \"vintage\" tube amp, but either cant afford or cant justify the price of a good one, you should try a V5"}
{"source": "Im the latter, because I only play at home I simply cant justify $1K or more for a good tube amp"}
{"source": "The classic overdrive sound of the 70s is all over this amp"}
{"source": " If youre looking for a late 60s - 70s \"cranked\" amp stack tone, well, its here"}
{"source": " But only if you crank the master and keep the preamp set low"}
{"source": "Turn up the preamp and all you'll get is a flat, flubby \"farty\" unusable tone"}
{"source": "I love and hate the V5, though the price is unbeatable, its shortcomings (no headroom/horrid overdrive) are hard to live with"}
{"source": "You sometimes what you pay for, and in this case, if you want that vintage 70s tone at \"bedroom\" volumes, you cant go wrong with the V5"}
{"source": "This little amp gives a warm and gritty sound"}
{"source": " Arrived in days and free ship (heavy little bugger)"}
{"source": " Small footprint allows me to place in my studio and get that deep sound like a big tube amp"}
{"source": " Use a Shure mike at 2 feet and the sound is amazing"}
{"source": " Recommend this amp for a small space or miked in small venue"}
{"source": " Really happy with sound"}
{"source": "This amp really surprized me"}
{"source": " It's made in china but it appears to be well madeand looks great"}
{"source": " There is a headphone jack which is why I bought it"}
{"source": "I would suggest useing a overdrive or distortion pedal"}
{"source": " gain here isnt great reverb isnt great ether"}
{"source": " But over all this amp is a most welcome deal"}
{"source": " No transistor amp I own sounds as good"}
{"source": " but I would suggest pedals"}
{"source": "This is a great little amp especially for the money"}
{"source": " It's all tube, has a power attenuator, headphone out and reverb all for under $200 - CRAZY!! It's built extremely well and has some weight to it, but you'd have no problem carrying it to a small gig"}
{"source": " A 5 watt tube amp is still quite LOUD, so the attenuator is a god-send"}
{"source": "How does it sound you ask? Tone is subjective, but to my ears it can get quite \"Marshally\" without a lot of work with a Les Paul as well as a Tele"}
{"source": " I don't own a Strat, so I can't comment on single coils through it"}
{"source": " On the 1 watt setting with the volume pinned and the gain on about 5 I had a damn good \"Back In Black\" style hard rock tone"}
{"source": " If you want to play Metal you're going to need a distortion/overdrive pedal"}
{"source": " I've found that if you pin the gain it can get a bit boxy and fizzy"}
{"source": " The headphone out isn't great, it's good enough for practice, but don't try to use it as a line out for recording"}
{"source": "I've done some recording using a 57 on-axis about an inch from the speaker grill slightly right of center"}
{"source": " When stacking 3-4 tracks (especially using different guitars) I got a HUGE, Plexi like tone without it getting muddy or fuzzy"}
{"source": "I haven't swapped tubes or the speaker - it's completely stock"}
{"source": " I might try putting a Jensen speaker in it, but the stock tone is just fine as it is"}
{"source": " The stock speaker is an 8\" Bugera \"vintage\" (think greenback clone) and it is darker than a lot of small speakers"}
{"source": " A lot of guys are swapping out the tubes for JJ's or GT's, but it all depends on what you're after for tone"}
{"source": "A lot of guitar snobs are afraid of the Beringer name on it (Bugera is made by Beringer), but I found this amp to be very good quality - especially given that it was made in China"}
{"source": "I would recommend this amp if you are looking for good tube tone on the cheap"}
{"source": " It's an excellent platform for mods if you are the tweaking type"}
{"source": " I was able to get great Marshall like tone out of it quite easily"}
{"source": " Good stuff!!"}
{"source": "I'd give this baby six stars if I could"}
{"source": " My prior practice amp (a Vox) was very nice, but finally went south and required replacement"}
{"source": " I was looking for something with a great tube sound, as most of the solid-state amps that I've used (mainly fenders and line6 stuff) just don't get there"}
{"source": " I was actually looking at the Fender Blues Junior and headed to my local GC to check 'em out and listen side-by-side"}
{"source": " The first time I plugged a Strat into this guy in the store, I was blown away (and that was with all of the Jimmy Page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store)"}
{"source": " I've gotta say, part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a Blues Junior, but the Bugera actually sounded better"}
{"source": " The only one left in the store was the floor model, so I grabbed it"}
{"source": "Got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations:- It's solid and heavy"}
{"source": " It's still a small-fry (slightly bigger than most 15w amps out there), but much heavier"}
{"source": "- The construction is great"}
{"source": " I think I read some reviews that knocked the construction, but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it's built to last"}
{"source": "- The sound is even better at home (without the GC cacophony)- Adjustments are minimal, but enough"}
{"source": " The tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp"}
{"source": " I've run my Strat, Tele and Taylor T5 through this"}
{"source": " I think the hard bodies get the best blues tone, but I can get a really nice clean tone from my T5- The headphones sound great"}
{"source": " I was really surprised by this"}
{"source": " I would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone, but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones- The price is self-explanatory, but that's really the part that blew me away"}
{"source": " This amp would sell for double the price tag"}
{"source": "This is a highly feature-full amp at this price point"}
{"source": " I can get great clean, blues and heavy metal tones"}
{"source": " Like most Line 6 products, some features are not highly apparent"}
{"source": " For example, for extra gain, you can hold down the tuner button and turn the gain knob past 12 o'clock for a boost"}
{"source": " This may not sound like much, but it really CAN change the tone, even on clean channels"}
{"source": " On the crunch channel, for example, it gives the guitar an almost fuzz face overdriven sound (with my Strat)"}
{"source": " On the metal channels, it really drives the gain over the top"}
{"source": "The tuner seems to work well enough and the included effects are OK"}
{"source": " I decided to go with the cheaper FBV2 pedal (which is still over 1/3 the price of this amp!) and it really works well for home practice situations"}
{"source": " One can switch between clean and metal, or clean and blues without too much trouble (one click)"}
{"source": " I think the pedals are too expensive personally, but they are well constructed solid steel and seem very durable"}
{"source": " The cable is a simple cat 5 network cable I believe, so replacing should be trivial"}
{"source": "I live in an apartment and this little 15-watt amp is WAY too loud to turn up past 1 or 2"}
{"source": " It has a great tone balance (to my ears)"}
{"source": " It has corner protectors where even their flagship amp doesn't! Overall I recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp"}
{"source": "After registering the amp online (or by mail) you have access to 500+ backing tunes,with either drums or drums and bassline"}
{"source": " You are able to select from different genres such as Rock, Blues, Country, Alternative and more"}
{"source": " Along with this great feature, you can also take free lessons, from beginner to advanced"}
{"source": " You can even get custom settings, giving you the sound of such great bands as Green Day, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin and many more"}
{"source": " Along with lessons, tabs, and the ability to loop any Jam Track, Spider Online adds more than even I immagined to this awesome amp!! If you're still hesitant about buying this or any other Spider amp, just buy it"}
{"source": " I personally guarantee your satisfaction"}
{"source": "BUY IT!! (no seriously, are you buying it??)"}
{"source": "I just bought this amp for my Epiphone Goth Studio guitar, I've got it this weekend and I'm very satisfied with this product"}
{"source": " I'm not a proffessional but this amp is really good for the price you pay as it comes with so many functions, with complete add-ons on th webpage"}
{"source": " Solid, nice sound, very good quality to make anyone happy, except your neighbors"}
{"source": "Now after a couple of months I want to say"}
{"source": " this is great product in terms of sound, not so great in terms of small building detailsGreat for Blues style, just use it with clean and good reverb or crunch  and you will get amazing blues sounds"}
{"source": "My only con and that's why I have reduced it to 4 stars is the fact that one of the corners protectors came broken and also, the Phones are not working"}
{"source": " Better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen"}
{"source": " I wrote to Line6 and I got useless answers about"}
{"source": "Hundreds of sounds to choose from"}
{"source": "Tones, bands, specific songs, sounds"}
{"source": "Built in tunerManually adjust Tone, drive, bass mid treble, gain pitch, chorus phaser tremolo, Tape echo sweep echo delay, reverb and master volumeMp3 inHeadphone / line outLoop recordingVery versatile and very fun"}
{"source": "Twang to Slayer in a flip of a preset"}
{"source": "I've been playing rock and blues for over 40 years"}
{"source": " I've owned a number of amps over the years including a 1960s Ampeg 40 Watt combo, and a pre-CBS 100 watt Fender Showman, and my latest, a Crate 5212 50 Watt tube amp that I bought about 10 years ago"}
{"source": "  I also have a small Peavy 50 Watt solid state combo"}
{"source": "  The Crate has always sounded great, and it's what I use exclusively in my basement studio, but it  weighs a ton and the clean channel has always had a habit of fading in and out (despite numerous repair attempts), so I've been using the Peavy when I play out"}
{"source": "  The last time I did, I was really unsatisfied with the sound and decided to look for something else"}
{"source": "  I own a Line6 pocket Pod and love it so I looked into the Line6 amps"}
{"source": "When I found that I could get a 75 Watt modeling amp with a looper and a more presets than I could go through in a lifetime for less than $300, I ordered one from Amazon, sight unseen and unheard"}
{"source": "  Out of the box I was amazed at just about everything"}
{"source": "  The clean amp models are crisp and clear, the dirty ones thick and rich"}
{"source": "  The effects that I have played around with so far are amazing, and I cannot detect any difference between them and my digital delay, phaser and overdrive pedals that cost about the same as the whole Spider IV 75"}
{"source": " And the thing is loud!  Very loud"}
{"source": "  As I get more experience with the amp, I'm sure that I'm going to want to tweak the built in presets to my taste, but even right out of the box the sound is pretty awesome"}
{"source": "I'm sure that a lot of pro purists out there would laugh at the idea of a 75 Watt solid state combo with 1 12\" speaker as their main amp, and if you've got $1800 to spend and a roadie, I guess they'd be right"}
{"source": " But for the money, the sound, the size and the very light weight (36 lbs) alone make this a fabulous deal"}
{"source": " Add in the modeling and the effects (high quality individual floor pedals or rack devices to replicate these effects could cost thousands of dollars just by themselves), and compared to my $750 Crate VC5212, at $300 the Spider IV 75 seems like an almost impossibly large gain in overall function"}
{"source": " I doubt that I will use my Crate again (except when guests come to jam)"}
{"source": "And then the less than good"}
{"source": "It doesn't come with a foot switch"}
{"source": "  You have to buy one if you want to be able to use the looping in any realistic way and/or take advantage of the 4 channels on the fly, and to upload new firmware to the amp"}
{"source": "  And of course you really want to do all if that (and more), so a foot controller is essential"}
{"source": "  I opted for the FBV Express Mk II, the smallest and least expensive model with a pedal"}
{"source": "  It lets me access all 4 channels as well as the looper and acts as a volume/wah controller"}
{"source": "  It was another $100"}
{"source": "  It is really essential, so in my mind the price of the Spider IV 75 is really just under $400"}
{"source": "And  it doesn't come with any manuals to speak of"}
{"source": "  All the manuals are available online for free, but of course you have to download them and print them"}
{"source": "  And these manuals are essential to access all but the most basic functions of the amp"}
{"source": " If you do not have access to a computer and a printer (I guess there are some people somewhere in the world who do not),I guess you're SOL"}
{"source": "  The \"Advanced Guide\" is the essential one for using the amp, and is only 3 pages long"}
{"source": " That's too short to explain everything you need to know in enough detail, and it's not particularly well-written"}
{"source": " There'a another manual for using the free downloadable software that lets you edit the presets at a low level that is another 21 pages long"}
{"source": "  I have not explored it much yet, but I suspect that it will be written similarly"}
{"source": "  Once again, if you do not have a computer with an internet connection, there is a bunch of stuff that it is possible to do with the Spider IV 75 that you will not be able to do"}
{"source": "My guess is that it would have probably added $150 to the list price of the amp for Line6 to have included a pedal and hard copies of the manual, and at $450, the amp would seem less attractive to many, so Line6 opted to handle things the way they did"}
{"source": " Bottom line is still that this is still an unbeatable deal"}
{"source": "Very HIghly Recommended"}
{"source": "JM Tepper"}
{"source": "I don't gig"}
{"source": " It is unlikely that I will ever play in front of a crowd"}
{"source": " But if you're like me, play as a hobby and like to fart around with various sounds and genres, this amp is a blast"}
{"source": " It is very likely that I will play a Johnny Cash song on Tuesday and a Metallica song on Wednesday"}
{"source": " Pretty much just make sure your guitar is in tune and dial up the sound"}
{"source": " No pedals, no hours of minor tweaks, just punch it up and learn the song"}
{"source": " Virtually every genre is represented here"}
{"source": " I also have to mention that although I like metal, I rarely play it"}
{"source": " I prefer traditional R'n'R sounds and the Spider IV recreates tons of my favorites in addition to the high gain ultra noisey sounds"}
{"source": " Even with the best modeling in the world, my Les Paul does not sound like a Strat being played through 65' Fender"}
{"source": " It sounds digital"}
{"source": " No getting around it"}
{"source": "Something else that weighed into my purchase was durability"}
{"source": " Although I only play for fun, I still play 2-3 hours a day"}
{"source": " My 9 year old also is learning to play, so it gets a lot of use and moves from game room to garage to bedroom daily"}
{"source": " The one thing that was common in virtually all of the reviews of Line 6 amps was that they were long lasting and durable"}
{"source": " I have a family member that is a professional musician and one of his band members gig with the larger 120 just becuase they can take such a beating"}
{"source": "Ultimately I decided that for the price ($300 at the time), I couldn't beat the Line 6"}
{"source": " There is just no comparing a tube amp with effect pedals against a solid state modeling amp"}
{"source": " They sound better, more prefessional"}
{"source": " They are also designed to be played loud to get the most out of the tubes"}
{"source": " Although the Line 6 sounds tinny and at max volume, for in home play, it sounds terrific"}
{"source": " There are mountains of reviews that compare the Line 6 to Vox, Marshall or Fender"}
{"source": " They are ALL better than the Line6, every one of them"}
{"source": " But be prepared to pay 10 times the price for effects pedals, head units, cabinets, cables, etc"}
{"source": " to get those flawless professional sounds"}
{"source": " Good amp, great value"}
{"source": "I had been looking for an amp for home practice and for live playing"}
{"source": "  Ultimately, my search was narrowed down to this Spider and a Fender Mustang"}
{"source": "  After reading many Amazon reviews, I ultimately chose the Spider over the Fender because (i) I read that the Fender amps gave off a hissing noise, particularly with the clean channels, and (ii) the Spider had better rock/metal tones, which is one genre I play, among others"}
{"source": "  Regarding the sound, it is unbelievable!  And, to be quite honest, I've only been using the presets!  The cleans are ultra clear, and the rock tones are amazing"}
{"source": "  And, this thing is LOUD"}
{"source": "  In conducting some internet research, having a mega-watted amp is not necessary and is, in fact, not recommended"}
{"source": "  I discovered that the reason for this is because the \"sweet spot\" for the volume is going to be when the amp is about three-quarters of the way up"}
{"source": "  In home practice, unless you aren't married and live in the boonies, you won't get there"}
{"source": "  With live play, this could hold it's own and in the sweet spot"}
{"source": "  As another reviewer mentioned, if you need something louder because you're in a larger venue, the amp will be mic'd anyway"}
{"source": "One note"}
{"source": "Line 6 does somewhat force you to purchase one of the pedals because you need the pedal to update the amp"}
{"source": "  I purchased theLine 6 FBV Express MkII 4-button Foot Controller, and I'm very happy with it"}
{"source": "  I like the larger foot pedal switches on this 4-pedal switch, rather than the small buttons on the model up from that (a 6 button pedal board)"}
{"source": "Finally, I chose this Spider IV over the Spider IV 120 amp version, in part, because this Spider has a larger speaker (a 12\") and the other Spider IV 120 watt model has two 10\" speakers"}
{"source": "  I feel that the larger speaker provides better lower tones"}
{"source": "I started two years ago with a 15 watt Spider III, then along with other amps, bought a Spider Jam"}
{"source": " I thought they were all great"}
{"source": "  Now they come out with Spider IV, and the difference in the sound is dramatic"}
{"source": "  They are getting very, very close to tube sound"}
{"source": "  So much so that for the lousy $299, compared to say $1000+ for 75 watts of tube, this is a real steal"}
{"source": "Loaded with features, and hundreds of presets, it has something for everyone"}
{"source": " The Pitch Shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun"}
{"source": " And it will work with either generation of FBV pedalboard"}
{"source": " Says so right in the manual"}
{"source": " The only difference I see is with the generation II pedal you get a USB port"}
{"source": "Does it sound as creamy and smooth as my Peavey Delta Blues or Crate Palomino tube units?  No, there is still a little digital overlay around in there"}
{"source": "  But most people who are looking for a great home based amp, or maybe a church or small gig amp, this is a WINNER and the price is just nuts"}
{"source": "  Forget the Peavy Vyper, this is hands down much better and you don't have to sink another couple hundred in a pedal to get to all the presets like the Vyper"}
{"source": "A modeling amp will literally model existing Amps, Artists, and Songs from different years"}
{"source": "This amp does not have on board song or drum loops like the Spider Jam"}
{"source": "If you are trying to get a specific sound of a band or musician or place in time, then this isyour amp"}
{"source": "If you need a practice amp, go with the Jam"}
{"source": "I have both amps and as far as I am concerned, the Jam is a far better modeling amp as it does what the Spider 4 does plus drum and song tracks that you can play along with plus a whole lot more, even if it is based on the Spider 3 technology with a JM4 Looper as its engine"}
{"source": "While the Spider 4 (I have the 150) is a nice amp, it is VERY SPECIFIC to the user needs and isnot that flexible"}
{"source": "I do not agree that both amps are worthless without the foot pedals, as I used the Jam for a longtime without, and only acquired the Express pedal when I ordered the Spider 4"}
{"source": "Also be very aware that the Line 6 documentation on their amps is very, very lacking, to put it mildly, and there so-called on line videos and user groups are just as lacking as their documentation"}
{"source": "I own several tube amp combo and half-stack"}
{"source": " However, I wanted a smaller, lighter combo that would be easy to transport and wouldn't need any pedals, but would also be loud enough to practice with a drummer"}
{"source": " The line 6 spider IV 75-watt combo was the perfect solution"}
{"source": " Up to this point I haven't been very impressed by solid-state technology"}
{"source": " Sure, the cleans are glassy and crystal-clear, and some sound ok with the gain cranked and mids scooped at super low volume, but as soon as you turn up the volume a bit or try to dial in a smooth, bluesy overdrive, the sound turns to crap"}
{"source": " Not so with the spider IV"}
{"source": " I've been extremely impressed with all the different amp models"}
{"source": " ALL of them"}
{"source": " The different amp models each have their unique sound and characteristics, which means that your tonal options are literally limitless"}
{"source": " I play mostly metal and hard rock, thougn I use less gain and more mids than is typical among players of the genre"}
{"source": "I'd describe it as a hard rock tone with a vintage edge"}
{"source": " And I was able to get that tone in less than a minute of fiddling"}
{"source": " The tone in general is surprisingly warm and organic- very tube-like, which is a comparison that I don't make lightly"}
{"source": " Additionally, the highs don't have that artificial \"tinny\" sound that so often occurs in solid-state"}
{"source": " Solos and leads have more of the natural, smooth quality that tube amps are valued for"}
{"source": "The effects are fun to play with, though I've never used many effects in my playing"}
{"source": " I really like having multiple user pre-sets, so I can dial in the tones that I use the most and then switch between them at the press of a button"}
{"source": " The artist pre-sets are cool; it's interesting to see Line 6's take on the sound of many popular bands and songs"}
{"source": " Some are surprisingly good, like Cliffs of Dover, Master of Puppets, and Sunshine of Your Love, while others don't really sound like the artist, like Killswitch Engage"}
{"source": "I'm also impressed with the quality of the celestion speaker that comes with the amp; it holds up pretty well even at higher volumes"}
{"source": " The tone has continually improved as I've broken in the speaker"}
{"source": "Just in conclusion, there's basically nothing this amp can't do at least fairly well"}
{"source": " All the amp models actually sound good (can't say the same about my roland cube), and when you combine that with all the effects, tuner, mp3 connection, and user and song & artist presets, it's a winning combination"}
{"source": " This will never be my main stage amp, but for practice purposes I couldn't be more pleased with the spider IV"}
{"source": "*edited to add*: A few months later I bought the FBV express pedal board"}
{"source": " It's a simple, affordable way to get more out of the amp by making channel switching easy and adding a volume/wah pedal"}
{"source": " Especially if this is your main amp, I recommend getting a FBV pedal to go with it"}
{"source": "The so called lower priced brother to the enormous Line 6 FBV Shortboard MKII pedal, while cut down still has a lot of the same features"}
{"source": " Same quality build"}
{"source": " Self powered when attached to my line 6 modeling amp (a real nice feature)"}
{"source": " One less power supply to hook up"}
{"source": " Foot switches are easy to use"}
{"source": " Built in tuner works great"}
{"source": " The volume/wah pedal switching requires a little more effort than my old pedal but still does the job nicely with a firm forward press"}
{"source": " Programming the pedal really allows you to fine tune four amp \"sounds\" and have them instantly available when you play (either at home or on stage)"}
{"source": "Before I purchased the FBV I scoured the web to see how it works with the POD HD Desktop, and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking"}
{"source": "Anyway, I lucked out and found a used one going cheap, and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the POD HD desktop & FBV Express II combo"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " First, in the setup screen do NOT enable the FBV Express"}
{"source": " Yes, I know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " Read the FBV Express users guide and calibrate the pedal"}
{"source": " there is no need to d/l the FBV software for this"}
{"source": "Now"}
{"source": " In the POD setup screens you have the option to either have the ABCD buttons as ABCD, or to be FS5-FS8"}
{"source": " This behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the FBV"}
{"source": "So"}
{"source": " In ABCD mode you can:a) Select preset A, B, C or D from the group you are currently in"}
{"source": "b) Insert a volume FX and use volume pedal"}
{"source": "EXP2c) Insert another FX enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as EXP1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset"}
{"source": "ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but CANNOT enable it"}
{"source": "3/10/14 EDIT :Looper control is flawed"}
{"source": " You can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play/stop the loop"}
{"source": " you can stop from overdub but not start the loop"}
{"source": " seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugNice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching FX blocks on & off"}
{"source": " incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns OD on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching)"}
{"source": " YAY!! you cry, that sounds like me so its a NO to ABCD and mode FS5-FS8 it is for me!"}
{"source": "SO yup in FS5-8 mode you can do that, you cana) enable/disable 4 sets of block(s) using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (ie like volume or wah, overdrive level, delay FB etc)c) basic control of looper BUT cannot enable itEDIT 3/19/14 looper control flawed as stated abovec) enable the tuner?"}
{"source": "oh sod it"}
{"source": " nope you can'td) tap tempo?"}
{"source": " nope not that either"}
{"source": "So in summary, the Express is better than nothing, but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop"}
{"source": " the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buying the pod"}
{"source": " get the HD500x instead"}
{"source": "I have used alot of different mics over the years to mic drums, and this Microphone is actually good enough for vocals and sounds decent through my mixer"}
{"source": "  I would reccommend this to anyone that is on a budget and wants a good peice of sound equipment"}
{"source": "No problems with seller and product came quick"}
{"source": " I wasnt expecting much from the mic"}
{"source": " I mean c'mon what can you expect for that price"}
{"source": " I wanted it to lay down some quick vocal melodies over rough tracks and it's good enough for that"}
{"source": " Doesn't have a really great range, I think the RockBand mic has a better range than this, but like I said, it's a cheap mic so what can you expect"}
{"source": " Honestly I should have saved my money and been a little more patient to get a better mic"}
{"source": "Unless you tune to only standard tunings this thing is garbage! I tune my hellraiser to d then drop to c and it will not register"}
{"source": " the needle either flops around constantly or just does not display the proper notes"}
{"source": "I was looking for a portable fold-up stand that I could take to gigs and searched around"}
{"source": "  Found the Guardian at Amazon and thought for $10, how could I go wrong?  Oops! Wrong"}
{"source": "  The stand is sturdy and folds up nicely, but I found it next to impossible to get my Fender Jazz bass to stand up in it"}
{"source": "  The lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn't blow"}
{"source": "  This is OK for a lightweight acoustic that you don't care too much about, but for for an electric guitar or bass, no way"}
{"source": "I just ordered a different one with a tripod base and a neck support"}
{"source": "  Live and learn"}
{"source": "I have an Epiphone Les Paul and this stand does not hold it at all"}
{"source": "  The holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor"}
{"source": "  Maybe it's a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric"}
{"source": "  But given that Les Paul is a pretty popular model of guitar, this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand"}
{"source": "  I'm rating it for what it is sold as, and for that, it gets 1 star, and only because since there is no zero"}
{"source": "I JUST BOUGHT A NEW GUITAR AND WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER ONE OF THESE"}
{"source": "  THE PRICE IS GREAT AND IT WORKS!  VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STAND"}
{"source": "Simply the best picks ever for Bass"}
{"source": "  Recommended by Eric Friedman on a post and Im glad I followed the recommendation"}
{"source": "  Cost Twice as much as Tortex picks so I use these Dunlop picks for gigs and rehearsal and use the cheap-o picks for my finger exercises"}
{"source": "I love these picks"}
{"source": "  They last a long, long time and are surprisingly easy to grip"}
{"source": "  Currently my go to picks"}
{"source": "I like this product"}
{"source": " The screen is big and easily read"}
{"source": " The meter is responsive and lets you know via a the needle, the note (sharp or flat) and by the background color going green to red"}
{"source": " It takes 2-3 seconds to 'hear' the string but then it locks right in for all notes, even the low E"}
{"source": "  It's really easy to use and I'm really happy with it"}
{"source": " Its so much better than my Korg CA-1"}
{"source": "  The only suggestion for improvement would be another swivel"}
{"source": " It takes a minute or two to figure out how to attach it to the guitar head and have the screen in the right position"}
{"source": " An additional swivel would make it perfect"}
{"source": "it tunes my ukuleles! it tunes my guitar! i can even see how close my voice is to being on pitch! hooray for this tuner"}
{"source": "I have the PT2, which is not backlit, so I bought this one for use in dimly-lit venues"}
{"source": " It worked great right out of the box: put in the battery, clipped it onto a standard acoustic guitar headstock, turned it on, and began tuning"}
{"source": " The display is big ( 1-1/4\" X 1-1/4 \"), bright even in a bright room, and when the string is in-tune, the backlit background turns from red to green( like Christmas!)"}
{"source": " I put on a brand new set of strings, and used it to bring each one up to pitch"}
{"source": " I found that plucking the string with your finger and then adjusting makes the tuner \"waver\" less, probably because fewer overtones are being produced"}
{"source": " All of these type of tuners have some degree of hesitancy when reading the string pitch, moreso on some of the strings than others, but I found that this unit locked in on the signal quickly and gave a very accurate reading"}
{"source": " I can use a pick to pluck the string as well and this device, after a very brief pause( less than a 10th of a second), gives me a reading or gives me the green"}
{"source": " I don't use any of the other features"}
{"source": " I also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrument"}
{"source": "The only other comment I have about it is that the on button should have been placed on the top of the unit as you clip it onto the headstock, but I just mount the unit over towards one side, and turn it on and off from the bottom"}
{"source": "I would highly recommend this for a anyone looking to quickly tune-up a guitar in a noisy, dimly-lit room"}
{"source": "Update-August 2012: Replaced the battery after 2 years, with a good quality Sony lithium, and the tuner is still going strong!"}
{"source": "I bought one of these about a year ago and I am going to buy a second one to keep in my gutar case as a back-up"}
{"source": " Great tuner, just clip it on the headstock, turn it on and tune -- display changes to bright green when you are exactly in tune so I can even do it without my glasses on"}
{"source": " I have used it in noisy environments (other instruments tuning or playing) and it still works, never had a problem with it picking up tuning informatiom clipped to the headstock of either my acoustic guitar or Fender Stratocastor"}
{"source": "The ONLY thing that could use improvement is the auto-off function; mine has failed to detect an extended duration of NO audio energy and as such, stayed turned on until it drained the battery"}
{"source": " After that, I got in the habit of making SURE I turned it off when not in use"}
{"source": " And it uses commonly found 2032 cell batteries so not A big deal to replace (just grab a two-pack of them at the grocery store to keep on hand)"}
{"source": "Overall, very useful, accurate device and worth a few extra dollars"}
{"source": "After online research, I decided to buy (and found locally) this midi pad to use in Reason 4"}
{"source": " Although not confirmed (online) as working with Reason, I was happy to see it worked immediately with no problems"}
{"source": " My CPU is Windows 7, but it worked on my MSI netbook also"}
{"source": " This unit also worked in Ableton Live (as stated online)"}
{"source": " I would recommend this pad to anyone looking for an affordable midi drum pad that works in many music programs"}
{"source": "I love the pads and the knobs"}
{"source": " I used it with Live 8"}
{"source": " The software side requires a bit of configuration to work with some software, but ultimately was stable and functional EXCEPT"}
{"source": "With my laptop, the USB power supply must be noisy, because the LPD8 will lose its connection and power if you even gently touch one of the cables--however, it works fine if I use a (very cheap!) powered USB hub in between"}
{"source": " I suspect that it does not contain adequate filtering for the power supply"}
{"source": " So it may not work in some configurations"}
{"source": "Lose a star, because I really love it but in my configuration I am not willing to add a gratuitous USB hub and another wall wart to my road rig"}
{"source": " Nice try, akai"}
{"source": "[Updated update! 12 jan 013]I have tried a different LPD8 to compare--it does not have the problem! On the systems where my old LPD8 would be flaky, the new LPD8 is rock solid"}
{"source": " It appears that I have a broken one with an intermittent problem"}
{"source": " If yours has this problem, send it back while it's still in warranty"}
{"source": "So that's nice"}
{"source": " Now it's really a great product that I can, um, sort of recommend to everyone"}
{"source": " However, considering that AKAI \"professional\" has us doing their QC for them, I'd suggest saving the shipping box in case you need to return it for an exchange"}
{"source": "at least for a few weeks"}
{"source": "This is a great little keyboard for use with GarageBand on the iPad"}
{"source": " GarageBand recognizes it as a controller for the Keyboard, Smart Keyboard, Sampler, Smart Guitar, Smart Bass, and Drums"}
{"source": " You can even solo on the Akai keyboard while the Smart Keyboard autoplays an accompaniment! In addition to offering the superior feel of a real keyboard, this Akai keyboard has much more consistent touch sensitivity than what's built into GarageBand for iPad"}
{"source": "Unlike other keyboard controllers I've tried, this one plugs and plays with the iPad--no powered USB hub required"}
{"source": " (You do need Apple's Camera connection Kit, of course, to add a USB port to your iPad"}
{"source": ") It's not loaded with gimmicks--just the essentials, and the essentials work very well indeed"}
{"source": " The keys are 85% of standard width, which is large enough for fumble-free playing"}
{"source": " It's lightweight, compact and thus perfectly suited as an iPad accessory"}
{"source": "First of all, don't be \"oversold\" by the \"extraordinary value\" that some reviewers claim this fifty-buck inputting device to be"}
{"source": "  Akai is considered a budget-priced version of, and a step down, from Sony, which in the minds of some has dropped a few steps lower itself"}
{"source": "  But it's the ideal solution for many of us who may be working at a desktop computer with Garageband, Band-in-the-Box, Finale, Sibelius, Audacity or a similar program"}
{"source": "  The last thing I would do is lug a 50-pound PC or SP Kurzweil model (plus AC power transformer) upstairs to place on an over-crowded desk"}
{"source": " Even the 12-pound Yamaha NP-30, with its 76 notes, is awkward to use for this purpose"}
{"source": "  Make it nothing longer than a 41-note keyboard, but if you can get one at half the price of the E-Music 41-note, that may be the handiest, most practical device for your needs"}
{"source": "Sure, there are alternatives"}
{"source": "  You can click at a \"virtual keyboard\" that Garageband makes available for a mouse--but it's slow"}
{"source": "  Or you can download a virtual keyboard to your iPad (or iPod) for a couple of bucks, but it's limited to no more than an octave and a \"touch screen\" which, though superior to mouse-clicking, still isn't as satisfying or \"immediate\" as inputting by pressing down on actual, physical keys"}
{"source": "This cheaply-made--even \"cheap\"--but effective Akai keyboard fits the bill very nicely, especially for someone who's working in congested space"}
{"source": "  It's regrettable the company refers to it as a \"performance\" keyboard"}
{"source": "  It's nothing of the sort, nor should it be"}
{"source": "  That's the reason I initially went with the NP30, only to find that the bi-purpose instrument I had in mind was impractical for either intended use"}
{"source": "Take a look at the Korg \"Nano\" piano, and if you're a pianist, you'll immediately see the superiority of the Akai"}
{"source": "  But be careful not to be lulled into purchasing the deluxe model of either the Akai or the E-Music, or you'll be close to spending as much as you would for a keyboard that lives up to the name \"Performance"}
{"source": "\"  This Akai model looks and feels like a kindergartner's ten-dollar toy, but it's the best compromise I've been able to turn up for my crowded work area"}
{"source": "This will give you the delay and compression that you need for country twang on the telecaster"}
{"source": " It will also give you a rhythm track to play along too"}
{"source": " The rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo"}
{"source": " It is not perfect as it has no on/off switch, it reverts to default mode when you power it up, it is a little hard to set volume and tempo on drum beats"}
{"source": " It only cost around $60 so perfection should not be expected"}
{"source": " For practice and the home studio it is great"}
{"source": "After lots of researching I finally decided to buy this Zoom pedal, so far it has worked great, has all the features mentioned, lots of great options, also a great guitar tuner"}
{"source": " For those doubting, you actually can just plug your headphones in the output jack and practice without an amp, which was an amazing bonus for me since I've yet to buy my amp"}
{"source": " 5 starts, totally recommend it for a begginers guitar effects pedal!"}
{"source": "I got this in the mail a week ago and have played with it constantly"}
{"source": "there is so much in this little box! i was just interested in the drum tracks in it when i bought it but i have since stopped using all of my other effects and just used this! i highly recomend this to anyone who plays an electric guitar"}
{"source": "Very nice quality of leather"}
{"source": " It's just a little bit short for my taste"}
{"source": " The guitar rested too high for my liking"}
{"source": " With some creative engineering I was able to get it to the length I needed"}
{"source": "Very nice guitar strap"}
{"source": " I bought it for my ukulele and it works fine"}
{"source": " Good leather and believe it or not made in Canada not China! I would recommend this item for either guitars or in my case Ukuleles"}
{"source": " Good value! Great seller and fast delivery"}
{"source": " Thanks Amazon for a great product!"}
{"source": "Perfect for my obscure use"}
{"source": "I discarded the mic clip (or more so, added it to my collection,) and attached a RAM mount to the gooseneck"}
{"source": " Now I have a universal articulating mount on a flexible post"}
{"source": " What to do with it? I use this contraption to watch movies on my ipod touch on long flights"}
{"source": " No more holding a little phone-sized thing up to my face for hours on end"}
{"source": " This stand and the mount get the small screen right up to my line of vision"}
{"source": "It's always been a problem trying to keep the Desk microphone in one place"}
{"source": " Promblem resolved, by purchasing this stand my heavy Shure57 stays in one place"}
{"source": " The only thing is I wish the flex was a little longer, about three inches would be great"}
{"source": " But otherwise a wise and good purchase"}
{"source": "Works well as a tuner, but I did return it to buy the Korg tuner/metronome combo"}
{"source": "  Thought it would be easier to have it all in one machine"}
{"source": "  However, this worked fine as a plain tuner"}
{"source": "This is a nice tuner that works great"}
{"source": " nice part is it works on ALL stringed instrument"}
{"source": " I will tell you my 1st one did go belly up but Korg's awesome warranty covered it and my 2nd one works great"}
{"source": " This is the tuner you want!"}
{"source": "I have owned just about every tuner made"}
{"source": "  They all had pluses and minuses"}
{"source": "  I like this one a lot"}
{"source": "  It is my tuner of choice right now"}

{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", near the the most treble-sounding string"}
{"source": " There it works perfectly and consistently even on that lowest E and it's entirely out of the way since my right hand is coming at the strings from near the bass-most string"}
{"source": "Bold_strummer mentions that it buzzed on his classical guitar, and initially I found the same problem, BUT it turned out NOT to be the tuner's fault, but mine"}
{"source": " After tuning, I had gotten into the habit of turning it face down against the wood of my instrument"}
{"source": " When I did that it made just enough contact with the surface of my instrument to create a buzz"}
{"source": " It took me two weeks to figure out what was making the buzz since the noise was coming directly out of the sound hole even though I had the tuner clipped to the head at the time"}
{"source": " When I realized it was the turner, all I had to do was NOT turn it down against the instrument when I wasn't using it"}
{"source": " Ever since then, no buzz"}
{"source": " Brilliant, huh?  c|:-?Another reviewer's idea about getting two of these so as to keep a spare packed in your gig bag is a great one"}
{"source": " At this price, why not? This is a great little item"}
{"source": "This little tuner is very precise"}
{"source": " It's fast, and easy to use"}
{"source": " I got two of them"}
{"source": " It works better than the ones with a built-in mic that capture other sounds and make it difficult to tune your instrument"}
{"source": " Works for guitar, bass, violin, or any string instrument"}
{"source": "The Intelli IMT-500--The tuner that killed the Intellitouch!There are scores of chromatic tuners on the market"}
{"source": "  Most work by using a small built-in microphone that picks up sound waves"}
{"source": "  In order to be used effectively, the tuning space must be relatively quiet"}
{"source": "  Many of these tuners have input jacks that allow electric guitars to be connected directly and tuned by the electronic signal they produce"}
{"source": " A bunch of years ago a variety of clip-on-microphones began to be marketed"}
{"source": "  The microphone could be clipped to any instrument and its cord attach to an electronic tuner"}
{"source": "  Now, anyone could tune an instrument no matter what the background noise"}
{"source": "Then, the Intellitouch tuner hit the market"}
{"source": "  The entire tuner clipped onto the instrument"}
{"source": "  One could tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment"}
{"source": "  There was no cord to deal with and the instrument could stay clipped to the headstock or quickly removed and slid into a pocket or case"}
{"source": "  Talk about convenience"}
{"source": "  Jams and festivals (bluegrass, folk, whatever) became seas of Intellitouch tuners"}
{"source": "Intellitouch owned the market even though there were so many situations where they did not work well"}
{"source": " In particular, they have trouble with the bass notes of dreadnought sized guitars"}
{"source": " The more overtones an instrument produces, the worse the tuner behaves"}
{"source": " The bass string of a Martin rosewood dreadnought was near impossible to tune without using one of the many workarounds that owners developed"}
{"source": "  So, it was very much a love-hate relationship"}
{"source": "  The shortcomings were huge, but the convenience meant that they were tolerated"}
{"source": "Then, came the Intelli"}
{"source": "  It was an Intellitouch that worked, if not perfectly, then a whole lot better"}
{"source": "  The amazing thing is that the switch from Intellitouch to Intelli wasn't gradual"}
{"source": "  Within six months of its introduction, jams and festivals became seas of Intelli tuners"}
{"source": "  People were throwing their Intellitouches into drawers (if they weren't lucky enough to find a die hard holdout willing to buy one second-hand) to get the Intelli"}
{"source": "  That's a considerable investment to abandon"}
{"source": "  But, why not?  The Intelli is half the price of the Intellitouch and works a whole lot better"}
{"source": "  They are so inexpensive that it's easy to justify getting one for the practice area and one for the case so that you don't have to worry about forgetting to pack it"}
{"source": "Anyone who will ever have to tune an acoustic instrument in a noisy environment will quickly find this tuner indispensable"}
{"source": "  And it works darn well in a quiet environment, too!Highly recommended!"}
{"source": "I only have used this tuner on classical guitars (the ones with nylon strings)"}
{"source": "  I teach classical guitar and have had the opportunity to use it on many different classical guitars of varying quality"}
{"source": "  It has tuned them all very well"}
{"source": "  A great advantage I've found using this tuner (Tune Tech TT500) verses tuners which use a microphone, is that I can now talk with my students while tuning and no longer have to ask them to please be quiet while I tune their guitars"}
{"source": "  Kids especially like to talk and now I can fully engage in conversation with them while tuning their guitars"}
{"source": "  The only problem I've noticed, and thus only 4 stars, is that I usually have to begin tuning with any string other than the low E string"}
{"source": "  For some reason, the tuner seems to have trouble sensing the low E vibrations and the needle will not move"}
{"source": "  This problem has always resolved itself when I tune another string and then tune the low E"}
{"source": "PROS:1"}
{"source": "  Pitch is registered quickly with minimal needle fluctuations2"}

{"source": " Recently ordered the red SNARK tuner here on Amazon, and I think it's much better- the Intelli does have the fact that it folds down snug against my guitar going for it- the snark is a little more bulky"}
{"source": "Ultimately, the most important thing for me when it comes to tuners is accurate pitch, and readability- Snark wins out"}
{"source": " this tuner works for sure, but I don't think it's the best out there"}
{"source": "The Snark is cheaper too!"}
{"source": "Jade rosin gives a extra grippiness to the bow"}
{"source": "  It hardly generates any dust, and gives the bow that extra grab"}
{"source": "  The only problem is that the effect wears off quickly"}
{"source": "  I use it in combination with Motrya Gold"}
{"source": "Very good rosin and does exactly what is described"}
{"source": "  A nice finish to the other rosin with specific bows"}
{"source": "  No need to try mix rosin when a new bow with the rosin labeled on the bow will reduce the mystery of trying to figure out which bow to used in different temperatures and humidity"}

{"source": "  It is very well made"}
{"source": "  This shoulder rest is very comfortable, and really helps get the right playing angle"}

{"source": " No adjustment is required once it is set for the instrument's size (3/4 or 4/4 -- arrived set for 4/4)"}
{"source": " It simply snaps on to the outer rim of the back, and the rubber feet keep it in place"}
{"source": " Good value for the price"}
{"source": "This does work as described"}
{"source": "  It arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out"}
{"source": "  The reason I only gave it two stars however is because I find it so uncomfortable!  Its quite hard on your collarbone"}
{"source": "  I have added foam to it and now it works well, but I suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place"}
{"source": "Everest EZ Series Shoulder Rest for 4/4 Violin is very good deal, if you are learning to play a violin"}
{"source": "It helps you to keep the violin in right position all the time"}
{"source": "I didn't use this a lot because it was a little uncomfortable"}
{"source": " But is a well made product if you use it for what it's for"}
{"source": "I am extremely happy with this product"}
{"source": " I own several shoulder rests, and this quickly became my favorite and stays on my favorite violin"}
{"source": " I have no problem whatsoever keeping it on the violin as long as it's in the proper position"}
{"source": " The adjustability is a key factor, and I can turn one side low and the other side higher for a highly customized fit"}
{"source": " The padding is also excellent and comfortable"}
{"source": " A top-quality product"}
{"source": "This pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need"}
{"source": " I would personally recommend the Electro-Harmonix Metal Muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price"}
{"source": "This peddle works great! I looked at many products for, just the right distortion and this one just topped them all"}
{"source": " So glad I went with the M116"}

{"source": " Well I have both"}
{"source": " The Muff is good for various tones, but the MXR gives you that all out full metal tone"}
{"source": " Having the built in gate is also nice and it works! The Muff is a lot more noisy"}

{"source": "For those that want to record(I use Adobe Audition) this item is good for recording"}
{"source": "I use to use my sound card"}
{"source": " This provides a smoother sound and I don't have to worry about hissing when I record"}
{"source": "You can just plug in your guitar or bass"}
{"source": "Here is a letter I wrote to Tascam:On humble advice I would forward this email to all of your subsidiaries any retail store that sells Tascam USB audio devices! Anywhere in the world"}
{"source": "Just today I got the new Tascam US-100 USB audio interface"}
{"source": " It of course uses the Windows audio drivers"}
{"source": " A nightmare occured"}
{"source": " When I plugged in the device Windows XP had the usual \"detect USB device\" come up"}
{"source": " But to my horror it wound up saying \"A hardware problem occured your hardware may not operate properly\" something of that sort"}
{"source": "I spent over 4 hours trying to figure this whole thing out and I read the manual it came with"}
{"source": " Tried all sorts of things oh brother! It still would not install"}
{"source": " By the way this happened with a previous USB audio device, not made by Tascam, that did the excact same thing on my computer"}
{"source": "But to my luck I found out what the problem was! Thank God for the website that had this on a blog!:In the c:\\windows\\inf folder there must exist two files:wdma_usb"}
{"source": "infwdma_usb"}
{"source": "PNFIt is really the "}
{"source": "inf file that is important"}
{"source": " Some software  seems to knock these out by renaming them to:wdma_usbinf"}
{"source": "bakwdma_usbpnf"}
{"source": "bakI simply found the files, opened them and renamed them to the proper names"}
{"source": " And lo and behold when I restarted my computer the Tascan US 100 worked!Its easy to rename the files you just open wdma_usbinf"}
{"source": "bakwdma_usbpnf"}
{"source": "bak and  then save them as wdma_usb"}
{"source": "infwdma_usb"}
{"source": "PNF"}
{"source": "Its that simple!!Anyone who works customer service for Tascam should know this"}
{"source": " Like I said it happend with a previous USB audio device that I had and I woulnd up selling it at eBay cause I was so frustrated"}
{"source": "I'm happy with the Tascam US 100"}
{"source": "I hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer"}
{"source": " And it did the same with a USB phone"}
{"source": "This Tascam \"US-100 USB Audio Interface\" is exactly what I was looking for to record from our wireless mic with XLR outputs, directly to my PC video editing software"}
{"source": " We professionally produce instructional videos and needed this for \"voice over\" work on existing footage"}
{"source": " Before getting this convenient little unit we had to record into a camcorder and then import it into the PC, so this saves us a step when we only need to record audio"}
{"source": " Here are my observations:+ Plug and Play; connected to my PC via USB and was instantly recognized+ USB Powered; no external power needed, a big plus when using my laptop+ Good Sound; clean and clear input+ Multiple Inputs; XLR, 1/4 Mic, RCA stereo line, and \"Hi-Z\" GuitarMisc:- XLR input is not powered (not a problem for us)- Includes \"Audacity\" software, but we did not need to load itHighly Recommended!CFH"}
{"source": "I won't recommend this to anyone, i actually used this one as a sound card, since doesn't work good for recording"}
{"source": "spend some more money if you want something good"}
{"source": "The US-100 works fine for my needs: rough and ready audio tracking with 32-bit Cubase 5 on 64-bit Windows 7"}
{"source": " My PC is for general-use with a non-studio configuration (no mixer, non-phantom power mics, headphone monitoring)"}
{"source": "If you're buying for a studio setup requiring phantom power or multiple inputs, you'll need a separate mixer and/or standalone phantom supply"}
{"source": " From the mixer you can cable to the US-100's line input via RCA jacks on the back"}
{"source": "There were a couple of hiccups during setup, but I don't blame the device"}
{"source": " It uses stock O/S drivers that loaded right up"}
{"source": " The documentation is minimal and only covers up to Vista, but it's accurate and you'll manage with Win7"}
{"source": " On the Windows side make the USB AudioCodec your default recording and playback device to override any onboard or card-based audio and speakers (I have Realtek onboard and 2"}
{"source": "1 desktop speakers)"}
{"source": "I'm using ASIO4ALL with Cubase and Cubase crashed a couple of times while configuring VST connections and I/O busses"}
{"source": " Once configured however, it's been solid"}
{"source": "I'd recommend checking out user forums for your particular software/platform to find similar gotchas and to set your expectations"}
{"source": "On an XP machine, changing the default sound devices often means the hassle of toggling settings before and after launching the DAW"}
{"source": " On Win7, once I unplug the US-100, the settings revert nicely to my desktop speakers"}
{"source": " If I plug the US-100 back in, the settings revert again - very reliable"}
{"source": " Even better, if I want to use Cubase strictly for MIDI, the software detects the change and I don't have to reconfigure connections or busses"}
{"source": " That may be a function of Cubase, so again it pays to research your particular software"}
{"source": "While the US-100 is connected, you'll hear nothing from your computer speakers and have to rely upon the US-100's headphone jack or audio out RCA jacks"}
{"source": " This is where the balance control is very helpful"}
{"source": " It's not a pan, it's a center position gain mixing the computer's output (from within your DAW as well as outside system sounds) with direct monitoring of your input signal"}
{"source": " Very simple to use for overdubbing"}
{"source": " Some people may prefer a hard left/right pan while overdubbing: I can live with the center mix though a switch to toggle a true pan would have been a terrific feature"}
{"source": "If you do want desktop speaker playback after your tracks are done, there are a number ways to go: 1) Unplug the US-100 and restart your DAW"}
{"source": " 2) Run a cable from the RCA outs on the US-100 to the mini-jack aux in on your desktop speakers 3) Run a mini-jack extension cord from the headphone jack on the US-100 to the aux-in"}
{"source": "While using the headphone jack, the RCA audio outs are muted and vis-versa"}
{"source": " Rather than having to pull out the headphone I would prefer a push switch that toggles the front to back output, but I can live without it"}
{"source": "Again, the US-100 works great so long as your needs meet its capabilities"}
{"source": " You can't rely on the product description or packaging to answer that"}
{"source": " Fortunately there's enough user-information out there for just about any setup it shouldn't be difficult to track down"}
{"source": "it is entry level but only records one channel even though it is misleading with multiple inputs and outputs"}
{"source": " It works as a beginner tool but only that"}
{"source": " mono only"}
{"source": "I'm sick of protools and I wanted to find something cheap and easy until I could afford to upgrade to some real equipment to use with cubase"}
{"source": "  This unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so I went for it"}
{"source": "I'm using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick"}
{"source": "  The problem is that it records a lot of hum and white noise when using the xlr input"}
{"source": "  I've tried every variation possible to make sure the problem isn't external to the unit"}
{"source": "  I even tested the exact same mic + cable input into my MBox with protools and got a clean recording"}
{"source": "  I actually like this unit's \"tone\" better than the mbox - it seems more transparent"}
{"source": "  If not for the hum, it would get 5 stars"}
{"source": "Unfortunately, hum is a pretty big problem"}
{"source": "  The hum isn't loud enough to ruin your recording of only one or two tracks"}
{"source": "  If you start layering, though, you can quickly be overtaken by white noise"}
{"source": "  I even tried moving the unit onto a different electrical circuit and still had the same problem"}
{"source": "So, it works for rough stuff for your own use but I wouldn't use it for anything you plan on passing around much"}
{"source": "Can't get your banjo to sound right without a great set of finger and thumb picks"}
{"source": " have been using these for years now"}
{"source": "There is no doubt about it, National fingerpicks are pretty much the standard"}
{"source": "  The metal fingerpicks are rock solid, sturdy-gauge steel"}
{"source": "  The plastic thumbpicks match tone very well"}
{"source": "  And, note that unlike what you may read in another review, they are adjustable"}
{"source": "  You just need to heat them up in some hot water and bend to fit"}
{"source": "  On my resonator, these provide a full, loud sound"}
{"source": "  The only reasons that for me these don't rate 5 stars are that (1) the Pro-Pick F Tone fingerpicks I usually use provide much more of a sense of feel, and (2) the National fingerpicks have a tendency to be a little noisier than the Pro-Picks on the guitar's unwound strings"}
{"source": "  Even though I like the National metal fingerpicks much better than plastic fingerpicks I've used, and even though they produce more fullness than the Pro-Picks, for me the sense of feel that I get from the open-finger design of the Pro-Picks trumps volume"}
{"source": "  This is important to keep in mind for players whose only fingerpicking experience is with fingers alone"}
{"source": "  Players who are already used to metal or plastic fingerpicks should give the National picks strong consideration"}
{"source": "  They are solid, sound great, and this packaging of them is excellent!  By the way, the bonus pick is cute (and will go in my logo pick collection), but it's a very thin gauge to be useful to me on anything other than electric guitar"}
{"source": "Just want to reiterate however what another review mentioned"}
{"source": " the thumbpicks both came in medium, which at the time I didn't pay any attention to"}
{"source": "  However, after about 3 weeks of using them (and the fingerpicks) on my banjo, I came to the conclusion that I needed a large size for my thumb (the mediums sat a little too high up my thumbnail for comfort)"}
{"source": " I suppose you could put them in hot water to \"stretch\" them out as I have read, but regardless, for a quick-n-dirty set for someone just starting out, its just the ticket without having to buy a bunch of sets of 12 to figure out what is comfortable"}
{"source": "  With price/assortment in mind, I give 5 stars"}
{"source": "Brass Tacks: is this the greatest mic in the world? No"}
{"source": " But on a budget this mic is AMAZING"}
{"source": " The lows and highs sound great and the mids sound well fleshed out"}
{"source": " If you are looking for s nice rich sound, this is it"}
{"source": "If you want to upgrade from a headset, cheap mic, Blue Yeti, or AT-2020; buy this mic and an audio interface"}
{"source": " You won't regret it"}
{"source": "I compared this to a C1 which is pretty good for half the price"}
{"source": "  I also tried two MXLs"}
{"source": "  One V63"}
{"source": "  This is much better hands down even if it costs 2x as much"}
{"source": "  I noticed the difference on guitar"}
{"source": "  On vocal it picks up a fair amount of noice around you"}
{"source": "  But I realized that it's normal and the other mike just didn't pick stuff up which is worse"}
{"source": "  The MXL v67g sounded warm on vocals and not too bad on guitar but if you got too close it gave you this fake low voice and that's just like taking the AT2035 signal and modifying it after you've recorded it"}
{"source": "  Besides the bright green and gold was a little too much for me"}
{"source": "  I tried the CAD M179"}
{"source": "  That did better on the treble side but seemed to miss the mids"}
{"source": "  I heard the AT2020 wasn't as good as the AT2035 so I went for it"}
{"source": "  And it's more than the switches difference which I don't use anyway"}
{"source": "  I didn't like the switches on the CAD M179 either"}
{"source": "  It's confusing and I do gain or filter in my DAW"}
{"source": "  I considered the NT-1 but at 80 bucks more than the 2035 it seemed like they were very similar"}
{"source": "  At the end I'm satisfied with the 2035"}
{"source": "  It's a work horse and costs a fraction of the more popular studio amps that have only a subtle difference to me"}
{"source": "  I have been staying away from AT products because I didn't like the headphones compared to Sony's"}
{"source": "  But this time I caved in because I don't see anything that competes at my price range"}
{"source": "  For me this works like an sm57 microphone and costs about the same"}
{"source": "  I can record my acoustic or electric guitar out of the cab or sing in it"}
{"source": "  My challenge is to not get it to record echo in my room"}
{"source": "  I've removed the door on my closet, put a shower curtain with a down comforter on it and record in there"}
{"source": "  Ridiculous setup but I've save hundreds in insulation costs and hours of doing that"}
{"source": "  For most vocals recording I don't use the closet"}
{"source": "  Just use refir and some recording tricks to remove any unwanted noise"}
{"source": "  So if things don't change this is my choice for best vocal and instrument microphone in the 100-250 price range"}
{"source": "  Nice solid construction and vibration mount included"}
{"source": "  It's rugged and I like it"}
{"source": "The best deal for recording beginners"}
{"source": " This mic can handle anything from vocal, guitar, drum, to all the other instruments"}
{"source": "It's definitely flat and natural sounding, which I like"}
{"source": " Just be aware it comes with a plastic shock mount, not a metal one like the AT2020 comes with"}
{"source": " However, it's usable"}
{"source": "I write and record my own music"}
{"source": "  I use this microphone for vocals and acoustic guitar"}
{"source": "  I replaced the cable that came with it with a Mogami and it sounds great"}
{"source": "  Crystal clear and it doesn't color the recordings"}
{"source": "  It will pick up ambient noise from the front, but that's to be expected"}
{"source": "  It does a pretty good job of blocking ambient noise from the back"}
{"source": "  Be sure to get a pop filter to go with it"}
{"source": "what part u dont likeyo u  can use eq to wash it a bit awayit is quite good"}
{"source": "CAN BE QUITE SIBILANCE PRONE, so beware"}
{"source": "ehso for the priceHighly recommended"}
{"source": "in these price ranges"}
{"source": "stick to known brandslike shure, ev, at, etc"}
{"source": "then come the newbies,a few models from mxl, etc etc"}
{"source": "have fun"}
{"source": "I've been in professional broadcast studios that don't have mics as nice as this one"}
{"source": " Good flat response, but you can also click the bass roll off and get a little cleaner voice if you don't like to EQ after the fact"}
{"source": " Sounds like a million bucks"}
{"source": "Enjoyable mic, has a decent frequency response range, nice patterning to not pick up too much ambient room noise"}
{"source": " I usually have to do some post-processing on vocals, but in the genres I work in that's not exactly a rare thing"}
{"source": " Either way sounds way better than I would expect for a mic at this price"}
{"source": " Haven't tried it for drums or guitar *yet* but I'm impressed with it's ability to accurately capture vocals"}
{"source": " While it doesn't have the warmth that some mics relay, I prefer it that way"}
{"source": " It leaves a really clean, if slightly cold/flat feeling, that can then be warmed up in post production nicely"}
{"source": "Good value for the sound, no complaints with the shock mount"}
{"source": " Though make sure to be cautious with your mic placement, get a pop filter, and if you have a room with lots of ambient noise don't be shocked if it picks some of it up"}
{"source": " All in all a good deal"}
{"source": "Indeed, this little blue-lighted wonder will make you famous"}
{"source": " Not unlike the &#34;Three Wolf Moon&#34; shirt, this little pedal will get you the ladies (or if you're a lady, it will likely get you the guys)"}
{"source": " Either way, it gets you what you want! On top of that, it does a great job of boosting your signal from your guitar and getting you just a bit of &#34;oomph&#34;"}
{"source": " In particular, I find it helpful when I'm running a lower output guitar through a long cable"}
{"source": " Did I mention it has a blue light? The only downside is that you have to open up the back (with a screwdriver, so put that on your shopping list if you don't have one) to adjust the little switches that chance the tone"}
{"source": "As soon as I kicked this pedal in at unity gain, the difference was obvious"}
{"source": "  I am most please at the boost feature which is amazing for one important reason: the noise level is nothing like what I was expecting"}
{"source": "  I keep my amp clean & I found that even at around 11:00 the noise was still almost unnoticeable"}
{"source": " At noon & up it's there until you start playing but even then, it's still much lower that the guitar"}
{"source": " There's also an almost expander/exciter FX going on which is very noticeable, especially when I compared it to my BBE FREQ BOOST"}
{"source": " First rate pedal!"}
{"source": "This is a very simple boost with a small footprint that fits nicely on the pedal board "}
{"source": " I like the simplicity and the ability to set the dip switches to my liking "}
{"source": " I find that with humbucker pickups it adds just the right, very slight tone coloration that both fattens up the sound and gives it just the right sparkle "}
{"source": " I don't use it much with single coils since they don't seem to benefit as much from the coloration or the treble boost "}
{"source": " it is a good pedal to have on board when you need that little something extra to get the right tone "}
{"source": " built solid "}
{"source": " a quality pedal that should hold up well "}
{"source": "I bought this boost to use in one specific situation"}
{"source": " When playing a lead line with my bridge pick up with the tone knob all the way down, my volume drops quite dramatically"}
{"source": " This boost does what it says it will do to remedy that, but it also seems to add a lot of noise"}
{"source": " When the boost is off, my super high gain Fryette Deliverance 120 is very quiet when I just hold my hand over the strings"}
{"source": " I'm using a 2010 LP Custom with a stock 490R pick up in the neck and 498T in the bridge"}
{"source": " When I turn on the boost I immediately hear a lot of extraneous hissing and noise"}
{"source": " When playing it isn't so bad, but I definitely am not used to so much extra noise"}
{"source": " There are a couple of adjustment switches inside, and I haven't fooled with those yet, but I'm definitely going to do that"}
{"source": " This boost will prob help guys with lower end gear get a better sound, but if you've already got pro quality stuff I don't see too much of an advantage here"}
{"source": "I have been tempted to buy this pedal for a long time after looking at all the rave reviews"}
{"source": "I already have an MXR line booster at the end of my pedal chain into my amp"}
{"source": " This serves to give back the lost treble and shimmer after a long cable run"}
{"source": " Replacing that with the EP booster did not have a significant impact on my tone"}
{"source": " Yes it was a little colored, but not too different from the line booster"}
{"source": "If at present you have no boost after your pedals and have a long cable run, yes definitely this pedal will make a world of difference by adding the top end back to the signal"}
{"source": " I didn't find it magical though, because I've always had a boost at the end of chain and this was not much different"}
{"source": "I am going to experiment with it in the effects loop to add a boost during solos"}
{"source": "Im starting a podcast"}
{"source": " I blindly lept to buy the blue yeti"}
{"source": " I can understand why one person with a youtube channel would love this"}
{"source": " Great for voice overs"}
{"source": " In sound proof studios"}
{"source": " The sound quality was good but it picked up WAY TO MUCH ROOM NOISE"}
{"source": " The ability to select the 4 recording modes is great"}
{"source": " If youll use it"}
{"source": " I would not reccomend recording 2 people at once on this"}
{"source": " However recording a choir or something would work"}
{"source": " But I will never do that and neither will you"}
{"source": " This microphone only has a usb port"}
{"source": " Not XLR"}
{"source": " So no hope of expanding"}
{"source": " If you ever want to host a podcast with 2 people you need to throw this away and get a mixer and 2 new microphones"}
{"source": "Or you can do what I did and get 2 Audio Technica ATR 2100's, 1 Behringer Xenyx 802 dual mic input Mixer, 2 shock mount/broadcast boom combos and 2 windscreens for the same price as a yeti, raidus shock mount, the pop pop filter and a generic mic stand"}
{"source": "Now I can replace my mixer and keep my 2 mics, or replace the mics then the mixer and do all sorts of expansions and add ons as well as get quality audio for 2 hosts on my podcast"}
{"source": "Do not get this yeti unless your doing youtube voiceovers by yourself forever"}
{"source": "After 1"}
{"source": "5 years, this microphone has lasted me a VERY long time and has stayed a fantastic microphone"}
{"source": " As I am getting more serious with voice over, I am moving to better equipment, but as a starter microphone/ microphone in general: It deserves a nod of approval"}
{"source": " Definitely a fantastic purchase, very happy with it!"}
{"source": "I have used many microphones, from  expensive Neumanns, Sennheisers, Sure, AKG to the less expensive Berringer B2 Pro and Sony"}
{"source": " I spent over 8 years in professional radio and 30 plus years doing voice over recording and sound mixing, so I have heard and used all types of mics and I have to rate the Blue Yeti at the top of my list for many reasons"}
{"source": " First is sound quality, all the patterns have a smooth, open sound, the cardioid pattern has added richness for voice over work, comparable dare I say to a Sennheiser or Sure"}
{"source": " The sound in all the patterns was not colored or muted at any frequency level, which what is I was expecting in the stereo mode, but in that pattern, voices sound great and an acoustic guitar sounded rich, plucky and natural"}
{"source": " Next is the construction of the mic and stand, from the pictures I was expecting plastic, nope, it is made of very solid metal , except the buttons and switches"}
{"source": " Third is the versatility, you can record almost anything in any type of circumstance not just adequately, but with excellence, try that with a $2,000"}
{"source": "00 Neumann! The set up could not be easier, just plug it into your USB jack and let her rip"}
{"source": " I only paid $100"}
{"source": "00 on Amazon,a true bargain, for what is a top notch piece of gear, where the engineers of this product really took their time to design something of real quality and looks like a piece of art"}
{"source": " The Yeti also stands up to audio processing, where I have to say all of the other mics I have used for under $200"}
{"source": "00 show their weaknesses"}
{"source": " The only thing I would like to see is a shock mount made for this mic, it is just too big for all of my other mounts, but the Yeti does not seem to pick up as much vibration from the table as other mics do (I also use a slab of 1/4\" neoprene padding to absorb some table shock), and the Yeti has no real audible self noise"}
{"source": " If you want a great microphone at an incredible price, the Blue Yeti is the one for you!Addendum 9-30-2011My complaint about the shock mount has been resolved, with the Blue Radius, which I received a week ago from Amazon, which I love"}
{"source": " Makes this great, and I mean great microphone even better"}
{"source": " I have done side by side comparisons to the Neumann U87, the Sennhieser D421, the Lawson L47, all top notch and very expensive studio mics"}
{"source": " The Yeti sounds as good"}
{"source": " Of course you have to learn how to work a microphone properly to get the right sound"}
{"source": " I cringe at some YouTube demos of this mic, some of the folks are not using this, and I'm sure other mike's correctly to get the best sound"}
{"source": " Also the more I use the Yeti, the more seasoned it becomes, in comparison recordings done a year ago, the Yeti seems to get a smoother sound, as time goes by"}
{"source": "This microphone in just a few words IS AWESOME"}
{"source": "  The sound recorded by this device in all modes left nothing to be desired for me"}
{"source": "  I use this mic for voice over work that gets added to videos playing in major hotel rooms"}
{"source": "  Superior mic!"}
{"source": "Eveyhing arrived in a timely fashion, worked perfectly out of the box, and has been used several times to record choirs and piano"}
{"source": " The sound is clear and well-balanced and the microphone picks up sound very well within the range of around 10 feet"}
{"source": "The latest addition to my desktop is the most flexible recording device I've yet found: The Blue Microphones Yeti USB Microphone"}
{"source": " Long known for their line of high-end condenser microphones, Blue is increasingly known for their computer-ready USB microphones, like the Snowflake and the Snowball, and the Yeti is their latest and certainly greatest computer-ready microphone yet"}
{"source": "Advertised as the first fully THX-compliant (a standard devised by Lucasfilms) microphone,  the Yeti is a large (12\" tall on its removable stand), hefty, multi-pattern microphone suitable for recording, podcasting, or any other computer-related audio activity"}
{"source": " It features four switchable patterns- omni, carodid, figure eight, and stereo- a built in headphone amplifier, gain control, headpohone volume, and a mute button"}
{"source": " For even more flexibility you can remove it from its desk stand and mount it on a standard 5/8\"microphone stand or boom"}
{"source": "And it sounds great, too- even better than their well-regarded Snowball series"}
{"source": " I've been using it for recording music practice, building tracks with Audacity on my Windows and linux boxes, and with Apple's GarageBand, and making calls with Skype"}
{"source": " The ability to record in full stereo or mono is a real plus"}
{"source": " Up to now I've been using a variety of microphones together with various microphone preamps and an A/D converters- a mass of cables and power supplies that bad enough on the desk, but a real hassle when trying to use with a laptop away from home"}
{"source": " The Yeti has it all in one package"}
{"source": " It may not sound quite as good as a multi-thousand dollar condenser microphone and vacuum tube preamp, but for the money it simply can't be beat"}
{"source": "I was looking for an affordable mic enabling me to make announcements from a home computer that would approximate, if not be indistinguishable from, the audio quality of the heavy-duty Shure microphones used at WGTD FM HD"}
{"source": "  All the mics that I had previously tried at this price point and lower, including Blue's \"Snow\" line, sounded overly treblish, with pronounced sibilance (listen to the comparison-contrast provided by the first reviewer in his video demonstration)"}
{"source": "  By contrast, the Yeti is rich and resonant, and its sensitivity permits using it without benefit of a pop filter"}
{"source": "  Short of spending 4-5 times more, I'm convinced this is the best option in my particular case"}
{"source": "At the same time, as a musician without a home studio I seriously doubt I'll make much use of the mic for performance or recording"}
{"source": "  As far as performance goes, the very size and conspicuousness of the unit could compromise presentation, upstaging the performer (at least a vocalist with a normal-sized head)"}
{"source": "  And for traveling purposes, I've found the Sansom Go mic to be the best fit with a laptop computer (even though Blue's literature shows the Yeti alongside a laptop)"}
{"source": "Blue appears to be trying to have it all ways with this product"}
{"source": "  Its size and weight are likely to attract buyers as well as provoke reservations--perhaps leading some purchasers to complement what strikes me as a home studio mic with one or more of Blue's lighter, more compact microphones"}
{"source": "  Its onboard amplifier and circuitry are convenient and permit unprecedented versatility"}
{"source": "  But as other reviewers have mentioned, the volume, gain, and pattern knobs are rather loose, allowing for lateral and vertical as well as the expected rotating movement"}
{"source": "  The knobs turn effortlessly but not with the ball-bearing smoothness one might associate with ultra expensive professional equipment"}
{"source": " There's the slightest hint of resistance at one point in the gain control's circular movement, but it's not at the 12 o'clock position, so it's difficult to say whether or not the knob is intended to have a mid-point for quick and easy assessment of positioning"}
{"source": "In sum, the Yeti should please anyone who wants to broadcast or record a fuller and richer sound than that previously attainable with comparably-priced mics, and it should prove a useful (not to mention handsome) addition to any home studio"}
{"source": "  It's still a bit early to make any pronouncements about the worthiness of this imposing metal humanoid as a road warrior"}
{"source": "  It's main competitor on Amazon--the Audio Technica AT2020--is pint-sized compared to the Yeti, and I'll confess I'm still not sure whether I made the best choice (the 2 mics have been alternating in the 1 and 2 slots of best-selling mics on Amazon for 3 months now)"}
{"source": "  I wish there were some direct reviewer comparisons to indicate whether the AT's relative compactness and light weight come at a compromise--however slight--to audio quality"}
{"source": "[I experienced initial hesitancy on Yeti's part to make an appearance in the Input and Output panels (in System Preferences) of my iMac"}
{"source": " Then I read the instructions, which discourage plugging the mic into a hub"}
{"source": " Plugged directly into a USB port on my computer, Yeti immediately sprang into action"}
{"source": " My hunch is that a good, powered 4-port hub would be equally effective"}
{"source": "]"}
{"source": "This is the best USB microphone out for under $100 bucks"}
{"source": "It's a shame that its been out for a few years now, and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one"}
{"source": "  I love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording"}
{"source": "  The sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as I have this fairly close to my computer in my office and I can't hear the computer in my recordings"}
{"source": "I haven't used this microphone with instruments, as I am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video, and it sounds great"}
{"source": "The only thing you have to do it plug it in, and go"}
{"source": "  You need no additional drivers to run this microphone in Windows 7"}
{"source": " I did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone, but it worked perfectly after that"}
{"source": "I just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shock-mount - YETI combo pack, as I have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and haven't used the base that much since arriving at that setup"}
{"source": "If you are in the market for an excellent USB microphone,  look no further, you can't get anything better than this for under $100 bucks"}
{"source": "  Just make sure you get a pop filter for it, and Yes the BLUE Pop Filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it doesn't"}
{"source": "  Just check out my review video for the Blue Pop"}
{"source": "Blue Microphones The Pop Universal Pop Filter"}
{"source": "This is a good quality microphone"}
{"source": " The sound quality is good in the various modes, although I have used it primarily in cardioid and stereo modes"}
{"source": " It's easy to set up"}
{"source": " Under Windows 7, all I had to do is plug it in"}
{"source": " The instruction manual hasn't been updated in years and gives instructions for Windows Vista and XP"}
{"source": " The instructions for Vista are mostly accurate for Windows 7, but I found that the default settings are better than the recommended settings in the instructions"}
{"source": " Also there is no driver supplied by the company"}
{"source": " The Microsoft driver will work fine, and there might not be a sonic advantage to making their own driver"}
{"source": " But it means that there is no custom control panel and you have to use the more obscure Windows ones"}
{"source": " Also the icon for the microphone doesn't match the product, which isn't really a big deal"}
{"source": " It's just a matter of attention to detail"}
{"source": " The instruction manual is in English and French, but the warranty information is in French in both places"}
{"source": " They both say there is a two year warranty and give a phone number in the Los Angeles area"}
{"source": " There's a copy of the actual warranty on their website, although it does have terms that violate US law so I have no idea how they handle actual warranty issues"}
{"source": "The only real negative I experienced when setting up was that it interfered with my keyboard"}
{"source": " I'm using a fairly standard Logitech wireless keyboard, and it experienced a lag, and not all letters showed up when I typed"}
{"source": " I unplugged the USB cable for the microphone and things went back to normal"}
{"source": " Repeating the process yielded identical results"}
{"source": " After rebooting the computer, the problem went away"}
{"source": " Hopefully there won't be long term issues"}
{"source": "The bottom line is that not a single problem related to the quality of the microphone itself, which works well, is very clear, and is extremely sensitive"}
{"source": " It will pick up a whisper from 15 feet away with the same clarity as if I were sitting two feet in front of it"}
{"source": " That's with volume settings that work clearly when I really am two feet in front of it"}
{"source": " The down side is that it will pick up every stray sound from letting your hand rub your shirt to letting your feet rub the carpet"}
{"source": " But those are practical considerations rather than limitations or faults of the microphone itself"}
{"source": "So, there are some people who review this as superb, with no noise and just the best thing ever"}
{"source": " To be honest, I have no idea where this is coming from"}
{"source": " I do get a good amount of noise (static buzz) that makes it difficult to use it when playing your guitar in a more quiet mode"}
{"source": " Also, the sustain is not as good as I thought it would be and I had to do a lot of fine-tuning with my amp to find a satisfying setting (works best with some additional reverb setting)"}
{"source": "That said, for the price, it is pretty good"}
{"source": " I do not understand why some folks are all upset about the plastic"}
{"source": " It is what it is, a rather inexpensive compressor that does a pretty good job for that price"}
{"source": "The title says it all"}
{"source": "  Great performance, sub par construction"}
{"source": "  I bought this pedal for the compression and sustain, though, and am very pleased"}
{"source": "  I use it for both bass and guitar, and it processes the signals well"}
{"source": "  I am sure it would work well for other instruments or on recordings also"}
{"source": "  Cheaply made, though"}
{"source": "  I removed a spring that was seemingly attached to nothing inside the unit"}
{"source": "  The removal stopped a terrible clicking noise that would have been audible from the stage floor"}
{"source": "  Plastic encasement means the unit will likely suffer noticeable wear and tear throughout its lifetime"}
{"source": "  Wish it was better made"}
{"source": "  Audio reproduction is great!"}
{"source": "More likely known as a guitar compensation device, the effect itself it widely used in everything"}
{"source": " I have couple few behringer pedals, some complain about plastic housings but a) I don't beat my gear and b) plastic doesn't get rust and corrosion"}
{"source": " The build on behringer are tough and fine to me, and the prices make them attainable to all players"}
{"source": " The only thing I say negative is all that battery junk inherent to all pedals, gotta spring for power supply plug, if not now, eventually because it'll drive you nuts"}
{"source": "Compressor is inherent to quack and pop of chickinpickin and country stuff you just can't not have if that's your thing"}
{"source": " The sustainer is just that adds sustain to any guitar regardless of build, so even a cheap one can ring like the best"}
{"source": "So you got both in one, tailoring will add life to even a dull axe"}
{"source": "  Some put down effects for whatever reason but this one likely adds tones that you can't do without once you find em"}
{"source": "I've been trying to get a specific sound for quite a while now"}
{"source": " This pedal completed that task"}
{"source": " It's hard to describe the sound that this pedal provides but it is perfect"}
{"source": " Very punchy and crisp"}
{"source": " You can't go wrong with Behringer pedals"}
{"source": " They are plastic though, so they might not hold up under heavy road use, but for home studios they are perfect"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": "Behringer pedals are the value leader in effects pedals"}
{"source": " I have four of them and my latest is this compressor sustainer"}
{"source": " It is very low noise and perfect for acoustic guitar and bass when leading music in a church setting"}
{"source": " I've had more expensive pedals over the last 25 years of playing, but it's hard to beat the price features and quality of the Behringer pedals"}
{"source": "What more can you ask for at roughly $25"}
{"source": "00"}
{"source": " This is a very useful guitar compressor"}
{"source": " It is a simple compressor, that's it"}
{"source": " Easy to understand with responsive controls"}
{"source": "I use compressors quite a lot"}
{"source": " In my PA rack I have a Yamaha rack compressor and an Alesis rack compressor"}
{"source": " In my home studio there are compressors in my 24 track DAW and in my computer I have the T-Racks Deluxe mastering software with several VST classic analog compressors like the Pultec as well as VST optical compressors"}
{"source": " I only mention these as a way of saying that I am very familiar with compressors and adept at using them"}
{"source": " I have a pretty thorough understanding of compression ratios,attack and release points and I have learned to use them sparringly and with care"}
{"source": " The Behringer CS400 does a good job as a straight guitar compressor"}
{"source": " It is usefull for taming levels from your guitar and boosting your signal which adds punch to the signal presented to your other effects and ultimately to your amp"}
{"source": " In recording circles you often hear good engineers say that if they can hear the compressor working, it's not being used correctly"}
{"source": " The Behringer CS400 is quiet, almost transparent (unlike the Behringer DC9 I discuss below)"}
{"source": " Yes, it is plastic but it's fairly well made and unless you are really rough on equipment with a little care it should last a few years"}
{"source": " If you are putting it into a pedal board it should last a long time"}
{"source": "If money is not a concern go ahead and spend more on a rugged pedal made of metal but expect to pay somewhere around $75-$100"}
{"source": "00 and up (Keeley,MXR, Digitech, etc"}
{"source": ") Unless you go over $100"}
{"source": "00 I don't think there will be a difference in performance and even then it will be subtle"}
{"source": " If your signal path aready has hum and static, this pedal will not change that and actually may increase it because that's what compressors do-lower high signals and bring up lower signals for a more uniform sound"}
{"source": " If you want to just smooth out your peaks and tighten up your sound with more punch, this little Behringer CS400 will do it"}
{"source": "(Behringer also makes another compressor pedal in the same price range the Behringer DC9"}
{"source": " It is all metal and attempts to clone the classic MXR pedal"}
{"source": " I personally would stay away from this pedal for live use"}
{"source": " I bought one and found that although it gives you great sustain it also colors your tone and seems to attenuate your low end quite a bit on the higher compession ratios you need for long sustain"}
{"source": " You can dial in more low end on your amp but if you expect to turn the compressor on and off on different songs you will hear a tone difference"}
{"source": " I don't use the DC9 when I play live but I like it on my guitar when I record using my VOX VT30 amp"}
{"source": " I like it better than the built in compressor on the VT30)"}
{"source": "Behringer makes a LOT of electronics for guitar and bass"}
{"source": " I have an FCB10 that I use and like, great controller for the price"}
{"source": " The CS400 at roughly 20"}
{"source": "00 is a decent pedal that will 'get the job done'"}
{"source": " Is it equivalent to a Boss, Dynacomp, Visual Sound or Keeley compressor"}
{"source": "nope"}
{"source": " You will get 20"}
{"source": "00 worth of use out of it though for sure"}
{"source": " The housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a PITA"}
{"source": " Just don't take a flying leap to stomp on it and battery consumption is really low so with a lot of use you may have to change the battery once or twice a year"}
{"source": " Good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point"}
{"source": "To test I installed one pad and left the original pad on the other side of my 440's"}
{"source": " The 840 pad has a larger surface area (see my pics with the old pad on the left in all shots) so I guess that spreads out the pressure over a larger area"}
{"source": " But it's really minimal and I did not notice a huge difference pressure wise"}
{"source": " The material is nicer/softer than the original so that is a plus"}
{"source": " Every so often I would flip the headphones around to see if I could tell anything"}
{"source": " The larger pad does cover more of the ear- almost surrounds it"}
{"source": " But seriously, if you had me blindfolded I wouldn't bet my life that I always knew which side were which"}
{"source": " But in general the large pad and softer material seems to be a better set up"}
{"source": " I can't imagine any set of cans actually feeling comfortable to have on for an extended period of time"}
{"source": "Sound difference? Yes, one side in my test sounded better I felt"}
{"source": " until I switched them around! Just like eyes your two ears are not 100% equal and over time they lose their edge but not at equal rates"}
{"source": " I think those who make any kind of big deal out of any significant improvement or degradation in sound might be imagining it"}
{"source": " I would have to see some measureable proof to believe that whatever millimeters' worth of difference in how the drivers may sit in relationship to your eardrums affects how the sound waves actually strike them"}
{"source": " Wishful thinking or all inside their heads maybe? Notice the contradictory reviews- more bassy, less bassy etc??? It becomes highly subjective and I wouldn't buy or not buy these pads based upon those claims"}
{"source": " If you need replacements this is no brainer as a cheap way to keep your expensive headphones alive"}
{"source": " If you need more comfort then these may do the trick for you but I'm glad I didn't pay any more for them than I did from Amazon"}
{"source": " That's my 2 cents"}
{"source": "Brass Tacks:They are Velour"}
{"source": " They fit on the ATH-M50 headphones"}
{"source": " That is what I wanted"}
{"source": "They are not a perfect fit, as they are MEANT for a slightly larger can, but it's more than snug"}
{"source": " Looks good too!(Remember: Because of the material, you WILL notice a slight difference in sound"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "I got these because they were recommended replacements for the Fostex T50RP"}
{"source": "  They fit great and are far more comfortable than the stock pads"}
{"source": "  For the price, they are worth it"}
{"source": "I don't own the SRH840s, but rather the SRH440s"}
{"source": " It was suggested on forums that these are a good upgrade for the 440s in terms of sound and comfort"}
{"source": " I didn't believe the sound part, but I bought them because I at least wanted to replace the cracking old pads on my 440s"}
{"source": " When I got them, they easily went on and looked just as good as the originals"}
{"source": " They are definitely more comfortable"}
{"source": " I don't know what it is, but something about the sound is different and I don't think it's placebo"}
{"source": " There seems to be more presence in the bass and clarity in places I wouldn't expect"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this upgrade"}
{"source": "I have used these pads on numerous non-Shure headphones like the fostex trp50 and the hifiman he-500 and I have to say that these are by far the best , most inexpensive solution to any headphone they will fit"}
{"source": "  They ave made the sound quality better on each headset that I have put them on, and they are softer and more comfortable than any other replacement pads I have tried in the price range,  Highly recommended!"}
{"source": "The title pretty much says it all"}
{"source": " This is such a simple, great tuner"}
{"source": " The streaming light effect is extremely cool yet totally practical! Great deal"}
{"source": "As is the case with all tools, you really do get what you pay for with this string cutter"}
{"source": "  It's extremely well-built, and performs its task very well"}
{"source": "Pros:- Extremely high quality metal- Comfortable rubber grips- Red accent handle makes it easy to find in a bag-of-tricks- Effortlessly cuts even stainless steel bass stringsCons:- Has no ability to lock the cutter closed for storage; the tool is spring-loaded to open"}
{"source": "  While this may be a plus for some people, I find it less than ideal"}
{"source": "Overall, this is an extremely well-made tool for your guitar kit"}
{"source": "  If you're a bassist that likes stainless steel strings, you'll appreciate how they cut like butter"}
{"source": "At first it seemed stupid to buy wire cutters just for guitar strings, but these do work extremely well"}
{"source": "  They seem to be very high quality and easily clip guitar strings right to the tuner post"}
{"source": "I do agree with the other user who pointed out the fact that they're spring loaded open with no mechanism to keep them closed"}
{"source": "  That does make storing them a little akward, but again, I think this is the best product out there if you change your own strings"}
{"source": "PS - If you are using scissors to clip strings ends, you are crazy - buy these things"}
{"source": "I had done a fair amount of research on banjos before I bought this"}
{"source": " It has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well"}
{"source": " Yes there many banjos and some with more frills"}
{"source": " There is no indication of where this banjo was made, but the quality is top notch"}
{"source": " I am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely"}
{"source": " I see no flaws on my banjo"}
{"source": " I did not have the problem with the 5th string machine being to tight as others"}
{"source": " I bought mine from ["}
{"source": "], the same place it ships if you buy it at Amazon best was 10 bucks cheaper with free shipping"}
{"source": " If I could give it more than 5 stars I would"}
{"source": " I can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy"}
{"source": " I also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck, that is not a issue either"}
{"source": " While I am expert on banjo I would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either"}
{"source": " A keeper for sure"}
{"source": "&#34;Quality of this banjo exceeded my expectations"}
{"source": " Great beginner banjo with quality components at a fair price"}
{"source": " Sounds good and the action is smooth"}
{"source": "&#34;"}
{"source": "I PURCHESED THIS BANJO FOR MY PERSONAL HOBY AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BEAUTIFUL INSTRAMENT THE QUALITY IS GREAT AND THE Playability IS GREAT ALSO, I AM A GUITAR PLAYER FOR OVER 35 YEARS AND I KNOW QUALITY WHEN I SEE IT"}

{"source": "great value, good quality and sound"}
{"source": " Very pleased with this purchase!  High value for low $$ risk"}
{"source": " You will not be disappointed"}
{"source": "I bought this not knowing what to expect"}
{"source": " It sounds just like I hear on tv and it sounds great"}
{"source": "I was disturbed with the price of banjos, until I did some research on the construction of them"}
{"source": "  They're not something a regular craftsperson can put together without some serious experience"}
{"source": "  At least, they wouldn't be able to put together a quality banjo"}
{"source": "  But Jameson Guitars had put together a great banjo and an incredibly fair price"}
{"source": "The tuning holds well and the instrument sounds great"}
{"source": " I'm a guitar player and I'm excited to explore the different sounds I will be able to get out of this banjo"}
{"source": "  It's also very good looking"}
{"source": "  I love the neck and the back"}
{"source": "  Even the drum"}
{"source": "  Quality work was put into this thing"}
{"source": "  I'm quite pleased"}
{"source": "Now, I just need to get used to playing with 5 strings! :)"}
{"source": "I have been online shopping banjos quite"}
{"source": " extensively"}
{"source": "  Ebay, Amazon, 3 dozen+ online shops, reviews from multitude of sources, investigating manufacturer home sites, etc"}
{"source": "  I did the same for this banjo, and although there is actually very little out there about this particular banjo, I still felt very comfortable with what little I put together information wise"}
{"source": "  And frankly, at this price, it gets my warmest recommendation for those on a tight budget (sometimes, you just can't afford 400+ dollars for a mainstream name beginner brand)"}
{"source": "  Additionally, mine came very well setup from the seller (aside from the inevitable tuning)"}
{"source": "  And its purty too!  I would also deeply recommendSnark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic Tuner"}
{"source": " absolutely the best tuner I have ever used and makes the various banjo-tuning schemes a breeze"}
{"source": "Be aware, in order to avoid possible confusion, Jameson Guitars is actually a sub-brand of Davison Guitars, so if you order and look at your peg-head and it says Davison (like mine does) and not R"}
{"source": "W"}
{"source": " Jameson, its the same maker (yes, I examined Davison's home site as well as the Amazon Seller's)"}
{"source": "This pedal is very exactly and had a tune all the string quickly"}
{"source": " It was a good purchase"}
{"source": " I recomend it"}
{"source": "I wrote a nasty review of this tuner a while back, blasting its performance compared to its competitors: the Korg Pitch Black and the Boss TU-3"}
{"source": " I still own at least of each"}
{"source": "Anyway, I have had this tuner for a few years now"}
{"source": " Stock this tuner was awful"}
{"source": " While attractive and compact, in single note tuning, the needle was not as fast and stable as its competitors, and the polyphonic mode wasn't accurate enough either"}
{"source": " Moreover, the display isn't as visible as a Pitch Black or TU-3 in the sunlight"}
{"source": " So while this tuner is great if you want something that looks nice and doesn't take up space on the pedal board, stock it just wasn't a truly great tuner"}
{"source": "However, that was before a firmware update"}
{"source": " After applying the latest updates, the tuner has become very usable"}
{"source": " The polyphonic mode is still not quite good enough to rely on 100%, but the single note mode seems just as accurate as any other tuner in its price range now"}
{"source": " So now you have a small, attractive tuner w/ true bypass that actually works"}
{"source": " So I have changed the review from 2 to 5 stars"}
{"source": " Also, given that the price has dropped sharply since I bought the tuner, now it is a much better bang for the buck"}
{"source": "So yeah, buy this product with confidence, but if you have purchased it used or if you have an old PolyTune, make sure that the firmware is up to date"}
{"source": " Without the update, this tuner was borderline terrible"}
{"source": " With the update, it's good enough to be the tuner on my primary stage pedalboard"}
{"source": " And in fact, it is, and it has held up to regular practices and gigs"}
{"source": "I found this to be very inaccurate but only on a few strings, so adjustment is not possible"}
{"source": " I bought this because of the newer features & I like the strum & see which strings were out function but what good are nice features if the main function of the tuner is inaccurate! It's not a bad tuner, seems well built but unless you play so poorly or loud that tuning precision doesn't matter I'd go with the Korg Pitch Black (which is what I was using in my home studio - well back to what worked!)"}
{"source": "I bought this pedal after looking at the Boss TU-3 and Korg Pitch Black for bass"}
{"source": " This pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode"}
{"source": " Strumming all 4 or 5 strings works well for a quick tune, but I still use the chromatic function to get an exact tune"}
{"source": " The accuracy is impressive and this pedal even worked well with the low B"}
{"source": "I read all over bass forums and reviews of the tuner and thought to try it out"}
{"source": " TC electronics seems to spend alot of time advertising its products in bass mags and online and some of their products are greatly overhyped IMO, but this pedal and the reviews speak for themselves"}
{"source": "I was able to tune an electric acoustic guitar in seconds using the sweep option and even tried a cigar box guitar reading just the AD&G; strings and it worked okay"}
{"source": "The pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze"}
{"source": " I chose to keep the clear film over the display for now to preserve the display as long as I can"}
{"source": " I tested this sweep option on an old Ibanez artcore guitar which hasn't been played for years and even with old strings, I got a reasonable tune out of it"}
{"source": "Strumming all strings at once seems to work better with a guitar more than a bass, but many reviews in bass mags and online also point this out although it works for a quick tune"}
{"source": "I am happy with the pedal and hope it lasts as long as my old Boss TU-2"}
{"source": " I feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze"}
{"source": "I like the pedal"}
{"source": "  It's totally silent, very bright display, sensitive meter"}
{"source": "  In fact, the only complaint I have is that the strum-every-string-at-once thing isn't as useful as you might think"}
{"source": "  Not that I ever use it"}
{"source": "  I'd buy this product again if I had it to do over again"}
{"source": "I finally purchased this in line tuner to replace my hand held cheap tuner"}
{"source": " This thing is way more accurate than my old tuner and because it is true bypass it doesn't suck any of your tone"}
{"source": " I haven't used the battery pack, so don't know about battery life"}
{"source": " I use a one-spot plug to power it"}
{"source": " Another nice feature is you can set it to turn off the volume when in use or leave volume on"}
{"source": " It's very heavy and seems sturdy and well built"}
{"source": " The display is a little confusing at first, but once I read the manual it makes good sense and is easy to use"}
{"source": "Being a studio owner I didn't buy this for stage work"}
{"source": " Being a player of multiple stringed instruments for decades I've had many different tuners including real strobes"}
{"source": " So when I picked this up about 8 months ago it was because I needed one where I was at and right now"}
{"source": "I don't know about the +/- "}
{"source": "1% accuracy but the pegs and my ear tell me it's quite accurate, enough that I can find notes up and down the neck that are slightest bit out of tune when using it"}
{"source": " By using a transformer adapter and a stage mic it also works very well for acoustic instruments"}
{"source": "I'm still using the replacement battery I put in about 6 months ago but I just use it and unplug"}
{"source": " It's travelled with me a few times and airport security finds it an interesting thing for me to have in a carry on but it almost seems durable enough to drop from 35,000 feet and continue working"}
{"source": "I was shocked by how well it works"}
{"source": " I was shocked by the fact that I could spend so little and get a real tuner and not a device that gets you close"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": "I normally tune to drop f on my 8 string, but even in standard, I just cant stand the strobe, and theres no other mode"}
{"source": " I ordered a pitch black for $70"}
{"source": " Im still waiting on the return for this"}
{"source": "As a musician for over four decades I've owned a number of tuners as the technology progressed"}
{"source": "  My primary instrument is electric bass"}
{"source": "  This is the finest piece of equipment I've ever purchased and used, and it has helped me solve a 'mysterious' tuning phenomenon all players apparently face without knowing it"}
{"source": "  I'll explain"}
{"source": "  But first, some details about the tuner"}
{"source": ":  it's construction is extremely solid, and it's heft gives it stability"}
{"source": "  When you place it on a surface (top of your amp, floor, your knee"}
{"source": " it stays there!)"}
{"source": "  Secondly, the large backlit display is very easy to read in all lighting conditions,"}
{"source": "no guessing"}
{"source": "  And thirdly, it is extremely sensitive and accurate, which brings me to my explanation of the 'mysterious tuning phenomenon"}
{"source": "  At issue is the inability of inexpensive tuners to properly identify frequencies/tones when setting string intonation at the octave fret"}
{"source": "  I've been using $25 to $40 tuners (Boss, Korg, etc) over the past few years that would indicate a string is in tune, both for open string and octave"}
{"source": "  But, when simultaneously plucking an 'F' note on the 'A' string, and an 'F' note high up on the 'G' string my ear would percieve that they just weren't in tune"}
{"source": "the cycles weren't matching"}
{"source": "  So, that meant my inexpensive tuner wasn't nearly discriminating enough"}
{"source": "  Once I began using this strobe tuner, it clearly showed me (with proper accuracy) graphically what my ear was trying to tell me"}
{"source": "  After setting intonation according to the strobe tuner my bass now 'performs' as it should through the range of notes/frets over the length of the neck"}
{"source": "  I guess another way of explaining it would be to say that it's like having a GPS that is accurate enough to get you to the right neighborhood, versus one that can get you to the right house"}
{"source": "  For the money, I feel I've done myself a good turn by purchasing this strobe tuner"}
{"source": "  I'm satisfied"}
{"source": "  I still keep one of my inexpensive tuners in my guitar case as it has a built in microphone and can be used by an accoustic guitar player if I'm jamming with somebody"}
{"source": "  This strobe tuner is 'cable input' only"}
{"source": "no mic, runs on a 9v battery with connectors for a power supply (sold separately)"}
{"source": "  My only 'complaint' with this device is the battery connector"}
{"source": "  It's the typical type that 'plugs' in to the top of your 9v battery with two wires leading to the internals"}
{"source": "  I hate them as a rule"}
{"source": "  I would prefer solid contact points and a compartment where you would simply insert the battery, just like inserting any other battery type (AA, AAA, C, etc)"}
{"source": "By now, you have probably read about the problem with the USB connection generating a high pitch sound during recording making the USB functionality unusable (an Amazon reviewer referred to this as a \"fatal flaw,\" and I heartily agree)"}
{"source": " I experienced this firsthand, then read folks struggling with the issue on the Mackie support blogs"}
{"source": " When I called Mackie support to seek a fix, I was told that the problem was well known and the newer lots had been corrected with new hardware"}
{"source": " They sent me a new Mackie Board from the newer lots, and I returned my old one"}
{"source": " I have not had any problems with the USB functionality since"}
{"source": " I am thankful to Mackie for the great customer service, especially since I addressed the problem after the one year warranty had expired"}
{"source": "I'm assuming that purchases made now will not have the problem, but if it does, contact Mackie to get a replacement"}
{"source": "At this point, I am still running the board through its paces, but thus far so good"}
{"source": "I love this stand"}
{"source": "  I am really disappointed in the cheap, designed-to-fail, bolt-in hardware used to adjust the telescoping rear leg"}
{"source": "I think this stand can last a long time if you don't adjust it much, but how much better would it have been had they designed one of those pressure collars with a flip tab, so you are not limited to the holes drilled into the rear leg?  The other hardware isn't much better"}
{"source": "For a $50 (list price) stand, On Stage took the cheap route rather than the quality route"}
{"source": "  Well, it's only an On Stage product, not Hercules, K&M;, or Atlas, or Ultimate Support"}
{"source": "  Cheap stuff, a budget brand, trying to pass as a name brand"}
{"source": "Great idea though, and the price is right at $25 street"}
{"source": "  Hopefully a better make will put out something more road-worthy"}
{"source": "I was honestly skeptical before actually trying it"}
{"source": " The specs seemed as if it would support my very heavy, very expensive hand-made 1x12 cabinet and matching head"}
{"source": " It seemed the only design that would allow me to tilt back the pair and it absolutely delivered"}
{"source": " The upright support in the back extends quite a bit and the protective foam is moveable and can be positioned at just the right location"}
{"source": " I am truly impressed and after using this weekend after weekend with a gigging band can soundly recommend this product"}
{"source": "I like this speaker system, behringer makes good products when it comes to this"}
{"source": " The sound is good and loud, you can control the levels and EQ directly from this so no need for a mixer"}
{"source": " You can connect an ipod or laptop to it"}
{"source": " And there are multiple sound options including phantom, and instrument"}
{"source": " I used a female xlr to 1/4 trs cable but I have been told you can also use xlr to xlr, although I did not try it"}
{"source": " The price was great and the wattage was nice"}
{"source": " I must say, when we have people come over it is easier to hear them sing"}
{"source": " With me playing on the piano it is sometimes hard to hear their voices but now it is equal and sounds nice in harmony"}
{"source": " I also connected to microphones to it and it distributes the sound very evenly so it sounds good in a duet"}
{"source": "UPDATE: I recently bought a guitar and started to use this amp for my electric fender, IT WORKS GREAT! The sound is great, the wattage is good, everything is wonderful"}
{"source": " Highly recommend this amp if you want a small amp for your guitar"}
{"source": "I play 1-2 nights a week in a midi-assisted duo"}
{"source": " Our PA is a pair of Mackie 15\" Thumps (powered) on the floor and Behringer 12\" B212D (powered) on stands with a Mackie board"}
{"source": " We adjust the PA to the room by adding or reducing the number of powered speakers"}
{"source": " In larger rooms we have a regular pair of floor monitors but in smaller rooms where you are stuck in a corner between the coat rack and the waiters station (you know the spot where they generously removed two small tables) we don't have space for floor monitors"}
{"source": " These smaller jobs have become much more common and I needed a compact yet powerful monitor"}
{"source": " Since we work with midi sound modules to reproduce the drums, bass and assorted extra instuments, it is very important that we hear these sounds clearly"}
{"source": " The Behringer monitors do the job well"}
{"source": " The overall sound is clean and clear, the speakers are light and portable and for me the boom stand adapter works well"}
{"source": " I compared the Behringers to their \"clone\" the Mackie SRM 150 and frankly I couldn't hear a major difference with my MP3 player playing through them"}
{"source": " Obviously Behringer cloned the Mackie's and did a good job"}
{"source": " They have all of the same inputs and outputs as the Mackie's and look almost exactly the same"}
{"source": " I have owned a pair of Behringer B21D powered speakers for about three years now and they have been knocked over and mistreated (accidentally) and still work great every night so I am a fan of Behringer gear"}
{"source": " In the end the real difference was the price"}
{"source": " The Behringer's go for $150"}
{"source": "00 while the Mackie's go for about $250"}
{"source": "00"}
{"source": " The choice was simple; since I couldn't hear (or see) a major difference I bought the Behringer's"}
{"source": " I have only had them for about two months but I have been pleased so far"}
{"source": "Update: It has been a couple of months more since I started using these monitors and have even purchased an additional one"}
{"source": " I still love the sound and all of the other things I posted above but: forget about the boom stand adapter"}
{"source": " It is very difficult to get lined up so the mic is facing you and because of the angle of the monitor itself which is not adjustable the boom will not stay in place"}
{"source": " I am using a good quality telescoping mini boom that is not very big or heavy at all but it will not stay up"}
{"source": " Save yourself the headaches and just carry another mic stand"}
{"source": " Other than that these are great monitors"}
{"source": "I bought a set of these from Amazon's warehouse deals page with a discount because of some expected damage"}
{"source": " They showed up in pretty good shape though to my surprise!I was expecting some damage to the items, but hoping that between the 2 of them that i would be able to salvage enough to put together one full stand"}
{"source": " I bought these because I needed ONLY 1 stand with good height on it for mounting my 32\" LCD Hitachi Flat screen to it"}
{"source": " I use this TV in my studio so that everyone can see what's going on when we record and work on music"}
{"source": " I needed something that was going to be sturdy and hold the TV high enough that everyone in the studio would be able to see it all the time"}
{"source": "Both stands showed up in good and working condition"}
{"source": " They go up to about 8' tall and are perfect for mounting speakers onto, although I use it to mount my TV about ceiling height which is about the same weight as my speakers if not more"}
{"source": " They work GREAT! I'm going to add some pictures of my creation when i get around to it, give me about a month"}
{"source": "Bought two sets"}
{"source": " Both arrived together and at the expected delivery date"}
{"source": " I had bought two sets of the Pyle Pro PMDK102 months previously which also included a pair of 25ft 1/4\" cabling from an Amazon dealer which arrived without problems"}
{"source": " Initially, I noticed only a slight difference in the two models which centered around the way the adjusting clamp allowed for the extension of the center speaker poles"}
{"source": " Personally, I think its easier to setup the Pyle Pro PSTK103"}
{"source": " Later comparison showed that the PSTK103 is also substantially taller in both the length of the tripod legs and the retracted center speaker pole"}
{"source": "However, the way it was packaged severely diminished my opinion on how much the manufacturer really cared about its own products"}
{"source": " The paint finish was chipped on several areas of the legs"}
{"source": " There were dimples and nicks in several areas of the leg tubing"}
{"source": " Why I blame the manufacturer's packaging more so than the way it was handled during shipping is simple "}
{"source": " the tripod legs have multiple connections which protrude from the joints and aside from the use of thin plastic bags to separate the two units laying upside down and side-by-side within the small confines of its included unpadded travel bag within its shipping carton, no other fore-thought of protection to prevent each tripod unit from physically rubbing or banging against one another during transport was afforded"}
{"source": " Really, how hard would it have been to just separate the two units within the travel bag with some corrugated cardboard or a strip of expanded foam?!!!On the plus side "}
{"source": " after testing each of the tripod stands "}
{"source": " all seemed to function perfectly well"}
{"source": " The units were light yet seemed solid and stable once set up"}
{"source": " The price seemed right thought and if the manner of packaging were improved "}
{"source": " I would definitely say that thus far it seems like a great buy"}
{"source": " Only time and after some use hereafter will I be able to determine if the unit holds up and is truly a bargain"}
{"source": "I ordered these stands hoping that they would be better than the price indicated"}
{"source": " However, the bag was ripped in 3 places"}
{"source": " The stands were both scratched badly with lots of paint missing"}
{"source": " The most annoying thing was that they did not match each other"}
{"source": " The locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights"}
{"source": " The holes in the inner poles were drilled  in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height"}
{"source": " They looked like they might be relatively solid but I returned them anyway"}
{"source": "bit disappointing"}
{"source": "Both of the stands had parts that had fallen out, or were missing all together"}
{"source": " When the pamphlet that comes with them states that they are fully assembled and guaranteed to be free of defects, this is a major concern"}
{"source": " It may be that I got a bad box that got missed by quality control, but it does make me suspicious of Pyle products"}
{"source": "It's a great strap"}
{"source": " It's comfortable and you can wear it for hours"}
{"source": " It looks good as while"}
{"source": " I got it earlier then expected and I love it"}
{"source": " I would definitely recommend it for anyone from beginner to pro"}
{"source": "I am very impressed with the quality of this strap for how little I paid"}
{"source": "  Nice soft flexible leather, and very adjustable"}
{"source": "  I had to lengthen the slit one end to fit over the oversize strap attach fitting on my Fender acoustic electric, but other than that it fit perfect"}
{"source": "When you need a no-nonsense leather strap that is not long, consider this"}
{"source": " If you need something fancy, or want to sling your guitar low, or if you are a tall person, probably you want to skip this"}
{"source": "I'm 5ft 8\" and I'm already using the longest setting with my acoustic that has a strap button on the heel of the neck as well as the end pin, and it's not like I'm trying to hold my guitar particularly low"}
{"source": " If you are a tall person, or if you want to mimic Jimmy Page's posture or something, this is not for you"}
{"source": "Apart from that, I have to say that the cost performance of this thing is really impressive (it's more so if I believe the \"made in Canada\" sticker on it)"}
{"source": " Hard to beat it as far as leather straps go"}
{"source": " At 2"}
{"source": "5 inches wide, it's comfortable, one-ply leather is reasonably pliable yet seems to be thick enough, and the looks of it is not that bad either"}
{"source": " Sure, there should be nicer/better product, but you cannot buy them for 12 bucks"}
{"source": "The only complaint I have is that a sticker that left some sticky residue was on the back side of the strap"}
{"source": " Though it was not a big deal to remove the residue using rubbing alcohol and some  elbow grease, it would have been nice if I was able to use it without any extra work without worrying about some gummy sticky thing rubbed on the guitar"}
{"source": "If you're looking for an inexpensive leather strap, this one will do nicely"}
{"source": " Leather is supple, not hard, and it looks great with natural finish guitars"}
{"source": " My only complaint is that it is difficult to attach at first (holes are smaller than usual, probably an anomaly)"}
{"source": " So for the price of polypropylene or cotton, you can upgrade to leather"}
{"source": "I searched on Amazon for a banjo strap and this came up"}
{"source": " When I received the strap I realized it doesn't fit a banjo"}
{"source": " I then looked at the description closely and found it says it's a guitar strap"}
{"source": " Just to let you know, this is not a banjo strap  :)  I was able use it anyway on my guitar"}
{"source": " It's not the best strap in the world, but it's not bad"}
{"source": " I gave it four stars for that reason"}
{"source": " I think it would wear quickly with lots of use"}
{"source": "I bought this strap because I thought the pattern was awesome! The comfort is okay, I never wear it for more than a couple hours at a time"}
{"source": " But"}
{"source": " just the design man, go planet waves!"}
{"source": "First of all this strap looks super cool"}
{"source": " The Hootenany style is sweeeet! I have this on a cream colored strat(like) guitar and it looks great"}
{"source": " The reason for only four stars is that the material is a bit thin, but hey, for this price I am not expecting a Levy's strap"}
{"source": " All in all this is a great guitar strap"}
{"source": " Throw some strap locks on it and away you go!!!"}
{"source": "It's very thin, all parts about it are kinda thin and cheap, but it works exactly as it should"}
{"source": " Not bad if you just need to round out an order to get free shipping"}
{"source": " Not for your favorite guitar though, more of a beginner's or a throw-away, 'gig' strap"}
{"source": "Does what a strap should- holds guitar fine and is built well for five bucks"}
{"source": " I like the unique pattern on this thing too"}
{"source": " Came in a timely manner, what else is there to say? Made in Canada"}
{"source": "It looks nice, it's really really long and it's made strong but you could also use it for slicing skin and maybe a whip"}
{"source": " After throwing it into the washing machine 3x with lots of softener, rubbing it with lard, dirt and baby powder, then soaking it over night"}
{"source": " It's finally soft and I could play naked without slicing off my head!  So buy it and prepare to really abuse it for a few days to soften it up!"}
{"source": "The strap looks great"}
{"source": "  Very cool design and looks good on my tele"}
{"source": "  And all for 7 bucks w/ prime shipping"}
{"source": "  So why only 3-stars?  This is my fourth strap purchase from Planet Waves"}
{"source": "  I have grown to love Planet Waves' straps for their comfort and durability, and obviously the designs"}
{"source": "  I thought that this strap was the same as my others only with a different design"}
{"source": "  Mainly because at my local music shops, I have never seen/felt a Planet Waves strap that was NOT made out of their usual thick, soft, and durable material(whatever that might be) that I have grown to love"}
{"source": "  This strap is VERY thin and brittle feeling, which makes it very uncomfortable to use"}
{"source": "  This strap DOES slide easily on your shirt (which is what I prefer) but once it makes contact with your neck it is SHARP and it makes your neck sore and itchy"}
{"source": "  Needless to say this strap is definitely not suited for playing without a shirt on, Ouch!  I have tried running it through the washing machine a few times with fabric softener along with using it constantly to try to get it broken in"}
{"source": "  But it is still as sharp as it was out of the package"}
{"source": "  Maybe with years and years of use it will finally soften up"}
{"source": "  That is if it lasts that long"}
{"source": "Overall what you need to know is that this strap is NOT the same as the other Planet Waves straps"}
{"source": "  The material is very thin and brittle feeling; unlike the many other straps from Planet Waves"}
{"source": "  If comfort is not important to you then get this strap"}
{"source": "  The price can't be beat and will give your guitar that 70's look"}
{"source": "  If I would have paid $20+ on this strap I would be furious"}
{"source": "  But at only $7 this strap is still a steal"}
{"source": "This strap has a fantastic old-school look and vibe, and I've never had it slip off while playing"}
{"source": "  The only downside is that it's a bit rough on any loose skin"}
{"source": "  I could never play with this strap without a shirt and sometimes if it rides up I can feel it on my neck (but that is very rare and only if playing with a loose t-shirt)"}
{"source": "  For 99% of situations these strap rocks"}
{"source": "At this price how can you go wrong?Comfortable and sturdy"}
{"source": "Works just fine, thank you"}
{"source": "Bought another for my Strat"}
{"source": "This guitar strap was so inexpensive compared to the other ones I was concerned that it would be flimsy and look terrible"}
{"source": " Since I planned on using it as a mandolin strap I figured it would be alright if it wasn't strong enough for a guitar"}
{"source": "I was pleasantly surprised to find it well-made with a clean, simple appearance"}
{"source": " I am getting another one for my acoustic guitar and may replace the leather strap on my electric guitar with one of these also"}
{"source": "I picked up a couple of these straps, one for a Les Paul and one for a bass"}
{"source": "  Anyone who's ever played a Les knows that a wide comfortable strap is a must-have"}
{"source": "  This one fits the bill"}
{"source": "  The end-pieces are thick, with a peg-hole that just fits--not so small you have to cut and not so large you're worried about the guitar slipping out"}
{"source": "  The cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable"}
{"source": "  It doesn't scratch like the plastic straps do and it doesn't grab your shirt so badly"}
{"source": "  Can't complain"}
{"source": "  Good strap at a good price"}
{"source": "Looking for a strap that is sturdy, comfortable, and simple in design, I use this strap along with and without the Planet Waves quick release system, perfect for use when I am standing and playing"}
{"source": "  I have several, for our electrics and acoustics"}
{"source": "Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help"}
{"source": "While not as soft and supple as suede straps, I am pretty sure this solid little strap will break in fairly well"}
{"source": " The button holes were a little tight, but thats not a bad thing"}
{"source": " It is definitely longer than a normal strap by a few inches and it smells nice to boot"}
{"source": " It is fairly thin but that should help it break in quicker"}
{"source": " All-in-all it's a good strap for the money, which wasn't much"}
{"source": "Planet Waves Classic Leather Guitar Strap Black is good product"}
{"source": "It's soft and pretty, and looks nice with my Strat"}
{"source": "Recommend it"}
{"source": "This is a single layer fairly thick strap of sturdy leather with a suede back"}
{"source": " At full price of 16"}
{"source": "99, it is a solid deal"}
{"source": " Any lower, and it is a steal"}
{"source": " Leather straps are a little tricky to buy online; You can't feel it or see the exact one you are purchasing, and every piece of leather is different"}
{"source": " Most of the time with leather straps, you get the quality you pay for"}
{"source": " This one appears to be an exception to that rule"}
{"source": " But if you are looking for buttery soft fine Corinthian leather with gold stitching, you need to understand that you'll have to pay more"}
{"source": " If you want one made from Wild Buffalo Leather or Free Range Mastodon Hide, you'll need to hitch a ride in the Tardis"}
{"source": " If all you want is a solid deal on a basic leather strap that won't let you down, this is a safe bet"}
{"source": " Oh and tight strap button holes? That's a good thing in my universe, as gravity is often as irresistible as the lure of time travel (on this Planet, anyhow)"}
{"source": "This is a very GOOD General purpose strap! A little stiff, but I'm hoping it will loosen up with use"}
{"source": "Most better quality leather guitar straps are typically $20 or more, so in retrospect, the low cost of this Planet Waves Black Leather guitar strap should have served as a red flag"}
{"source": "  I bought it anyway, hoping that it would be a decent product, but unfortunately, upon receiving it, I was almost immediately disappointed at the quality of the item"}
{"source": "While the strap appears to be 100% leather, and isn't a piece of junk, it doesn't appear to be of very high quality"}
{"source": " The leather is thin and soft, and I would not be at all surprised, if the edges soon begin to curl, and the strap begins to wrinkle"}
{"source": " I don't expect the leather around the holes for the strap nuts, to hold up well long term"}
{"source": " If you use this strap, you probably want to use some kind of strap locking system"}
{"source": "I have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years"}
{"source": " The leather is thicker and stiffer, and has resisted fraying along the edges"}
{"source": " While the leather has developed some cracks, it is still holding up fine, and there is no chance that the strap will tear"}
{"source": " I could be wrong, but looking at the Planet Waves strap, I have doubts that it will hold up anywhere near as well or as long"}
{"source": "If you are a casual player, this strap is probably fine, although strap locks are recommended"}
{"source": " The leather may start to curl up and deform, but the strap certainly isn't going to fail immediately"}
{"source": " While serviceable, more serious players, or those with an aggressive style of playing, might want to spending a little more for a better quality leather strap"}
{"source": " I decided to keep this strap, but it is installed on a secondary guitar that I don't play that much"}
{"source": "This is, for the price I paid for it here on Amazon (far less than what it is currently selling for) a very good buy"}
{"source": "  At the current price of almost 30 bucks, I would pass or look at other options but that is just me"}
{"source": "  The leather is attractive, thick enough, soft enough for the price, and I found the length to be more than long enough for me personally"}
{"source": "  I almost have it on the shortest possible setting and there is far more room to let out"}
{"source": "  Only really tall people, big people, or \"low players\" will be disappointed perhaps"}
{"source": "  I only have a few very MINOR complaints and of course my complaints are subjective so YMMV"}
{"source": "  One, the back side of the strap is not black"}
{"source": "  It's a blue/grey color and I didn't realize that"}
{"source": "  You can see a tiny bit of the greyish color in the photo but not enough to really get an idea of what the backside looks like"}
{"source": "  I assumed incorrectly that both sides were black"}
{"source": "  Two, the embossed design is a little feminine for my tastes"}
{"source": "  All that said, it is nice and some will love it"}
{"source": "  Quality at the right price"}
{"source": "  Easy to adjust"}
{"source": "  Looks like it will last"}
{"source": "  Solid four stars despite me personal opinion"}
{"source": "The material used is fine"}
{"source": "  The looks are fine"}
{"source": "  The length is horrible"}
{"source": "  This is too short for most adults that play guitar"}
{"source": "  It felt like I was holding my guitar around my neck instead of off my shoulders"}
{"source": "  I attached it by the longest way possible and it was well short of what I could use"}
{"source": "  To me this was a worthless purchase"}
{"source": "  I just tucked it into a drawer and it will sit there and not be used again"}
{"source": "Nicely made and a good value but it seems to be a bit stiff right now"}
{"source": "It is a single strip of leather with no padding"}
{"source": "Maybe it just needs to be broken in"}
{"source": "Compliments the color on my Lake Placid blue strat well"}
{"source": "For the record, this strap is actually quite long - even in the second strap hole"}
{"source": "I am about 5'9\" and a trim 155 lbs"}
{"source": "At the shortest setting I can manage, the strap is too long to keep the heastock up effectively when I am sitting"}
{"source": "Update 2011-Jul-31: The strap is still rather stiff"}
{"source": "I will probably pick up a white cotton strap"}
{"source": "Those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently, in my opinion"}
{"source": "I got a few of these as a Christmas gift and they're just bad"}
{"source": "  I put them on my pedalboard where I previously had longer cables and these just didn't stay in the jack"}
{"source": "  I have no other problems with these jacks with any other cable but these"}
{"source": "  If I play loudly and my room vibrates a bit, the cable even works its way out of the jack a little bit and cuts my signal"}
{"source": "  Awful"}
{"source": "I purchased a BUNCH of Planet Waves Classic cables for my new pedal board"}
{"source": " The cable is a little fat at the connector for pedal board use so if you have a tight fit this is not the cable for you"}
{"source": " However, I am very pleased to find the cable itself is quite flexible"}
{"source": " My complaint, like other reviews I read, is that the end doesn't seem to fit snug on some connections"}
{"source": " For me these cables fit very well with the MXR pedals, Dunlop wah and the Ibanez pedal"}
{"source": " The Boss pedals however, were hit or miss"}
{"source": " Can't say for sure if this is Plant Waves design problem or Boss, but it does seem odd it seems to be mostly the Boss pedals"}
{"source": " I have a couple EHX pedals also, one side is snug the other loose"}
{"source": " Anyway, for the money, I think you will be happy with the Planet Waves cable, nice moulded ends with a good flexible cable"}
{"source": "Nice quality plug"}
{"source": " I used this plug to connect my lower row of pedals on my pedal board to the second line of pedals"}
{"source": " Works great and no noise! The shielding on these Planet Waves cables are great"}
{"source": "This jumper cable is a decent cable used for jumping from one unit to another when longer connections are required & a 10 ft"}
{"source": " cable is too long"}
{"source": " I would not depend on it for night after night abuse but, it just may last longer than I think"}
{"source": " Planet Waves does make good products"}
{"source": "I absolutely love these strings"}
{"source": " I'm used to playing higher tension strings and these fit the bill perfectly"}
{"source": " They have a great full sound and after breaking them in after a couple weeks of playing they give a really good classic P bass sound"}
{"source": " Its not for people who want the modern brighter sound but for the classic 50s 60s and 70s sound these are great!"}
{"source": "Who would have thought you could buy \"quality\" bass guitar strings from the same place you can buy your DVDs?The strings are, with out a doubt, real Fender strings"}
{"source": " And even with shipping coasts they are STILL comparably-priced if not cheaper then buying them at a nationaly franchised music store"}
{"source": "But"}
{"source": "Because you don't have the opportunity to compare strings; I do recommend that you know what you want"}
{"source": "I've also purchased \"top shelf\" guitar stings, as well as a variety of other products, from AMAZON and have ALWAYS been satisfied with the qualiy and service"}
{"source": "In a world of round wound strings, flat wounds (the original bass starings) aren't as popular"}
{"source": " These are nice and bright "}
{"source": " love 'em!"}
{"source": "Great flatwound strings"}
{"source": " I put these on my J-bass over a year ago and they still sound and feel awesome"}
{"source": " They are stainless steel and very smooth"}
{"source": " I have never tried other flats except for chromes on my Tele and Fender tapewounds on my fretless, so my view may be biased"}
{"source": " For what I paid and how they sound, feel, and have lasted, I am very pleased"}
{"source": "This is my first tube amp and after doing a TON of research, I found that the VOX AC15C1 was just about perfect for me"}
{"source": "It came down to the AC15, Fender Blues Jr"}
{"source": " and the Ibanez TS15"}
{"source": " The Blues Jr"}
{"source": " has a somewhat small enclosure for a 1x12 and I felt it had a bit of a \"boxy\" tone, otherwise, it's a great amp"}
{"source": " The Ibanez has a classic Tube Screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes, but it lacked a reverb circuit, which was a deal breaker (silly reasoning, I know)"}
{"source": " The AC15 has a larger enclosure than the Blues Jr"}
{"source": ", and it has a reverb AND tremolo circuit, so it had the features I was looking for and most importantly, it produces some killer tone"}
{"source": "If you've ever seen or read a review of this amp, chances are, you've heard about the classic VOX \"chime\", which this amp has, but I fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away"}
{"source": " The normal channel will break up nicely too, but I would suggest an A/B switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirty"}
{"source": "I was worried at first that 15 watts wouldn't be enough, but fear not, this amp is LOUD"}
{"source": " maybe too loud as I'm just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom, but that's not a bad thing"}
{"source": " It totally blows away my 100 watt Marshall solid state and I haven't put the volume much past 8 O'clock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if I do"}
{"source": "While there is no effects loop, it takes pedals well, but for distorted tones, I've found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch, which I've come to love so much"}
{"source": " As stated above, the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp, or as previously stated, running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an A/B switch to go between them"}
{"source": " As far as other effects, I really like what it does to my TC Electronic Flashback Delay and Corona Chorus"}
{"source": " Note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel, but it controls the on/off for the built in tremolo and reverb, but it's sadly not included with the amp"}
{"source": "For my first tube amp, I don't think I could have done much better; I love the tone that I can get, the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp, it's feature rich, and takes pedals well"}
{"source": " The other two amps that I was considering were a little less expensive, and while I really feel that the VOX is just a better all around amp, I don't think you can go wrong with any one of the three"}
{"source": "The weight (about 50 lbs), and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that I can think of"}
{"source": " While I would have picked up all three of the amps that I was looking at if I had the means, I would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp"}
{"source": "This is an amazing amp"}
{"source": " It works great, a lot of power, a little bit heavy for it's size but it is simply a beauty"}
{"source": " I play a godin a6 ultra and the The sound of this amp is so clean that i can play my acoustic and my electric trough this amp and both sounds perfect"}
{"source": " Even the acoustic sound is majestic"}
{"source": " this amp adapts to any need you have, from the cleanest sound to the heaviest distorted sound"}
{"source": "I've had this for about 3 years and I agree with every one here that this is a fantastic amp at a good price point"}
{"source": "  It's a wonderful sounding amp and gives you good chimey cleans and lush distorted breakup"}
{"source": "  It only gets better as the speaker breaks in so make sure you put lots of hours on it initially and you will be rewarded"}
{"source": "  If it was between this an a Blues Jr"}
{"source": " which are similarly powered and priced I'd opt for this in a second"}
{"source": "  I think the AC15C1 is actually a better blues amp"}
{"source": "(Opinions vary of course)I only have a couple is \"wishes\" as they're not really gripes"}
{"source": "  One is the stock reverb"}
{"source": "  It's really overboard in a way that I didn't find musical"}
{"source": "  I ordered a new tank and now it's great"}
{"source": "  I hope Vox changed this out because I found anything over 2 on the stock tank way too much"}
{"source": "  Second would be an FX loop"}
{"source": "  Not a deal breaker as the amp takes pedals well but it would a good feature as wold be channel switching built in"}
{"source": "  Third and last I wish it came with a footswitch to turn the Trem and Verb on/off and switch between the top boost and normal channels"}
{"source": "  I know you can get it aftermarket but it would have been nice"}
{"source": "  Probably one of the reasons it's so affordable"}
{"source": "And speaking of foot switches do yourself a favor and get an a/b/y switch for this"}
{"source": "  It allows you to switch between the top boost/normal channels and also allows you to run through both channels at the same time and let me tell you there are some really sweet tones when you run both channels at once"}
{"source": "  I've gone through a fair amount of gear in my time but don't see getting rid of this"}
{"source": "  It's such a fun little amp that it's nice to have around even if it were not my main go-to amp"}
{"source": "  It's certainly loud enough for small venues and jamming with a controlled drummer but it's not going to shake the paint off the walls like an AC30"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended"}
{"source": "I play in our band at church and as such, I've been wanting a Vox AC15 for quite some time"}
{"source": "  For those of you who do not play contemporary Christian music and are wondering what the heck I'm talking about, let's just say that it's an unwritten requirement that if you do play that kind of music, you must utilize a Vox tone"}
{"source": "  Because of U2"}
{"source": "  I know this is sounding weirder by the second but just take my word for it"}
{"source": "Anyway, for the past few years I've been utilizing a Line 6 Floor POD Plus to achieve this tone"}
{"source": "  I've been using the \"Class A\" sound, which is close, and quite useable, but for some reason it sounds mushy on the low strings of a strat and I've never found a way around that"}
{"source": "  I just sort of dealt with it"}
{"source": "  Then came Father's Day of this year when my wife surprised me with a used Vox AC15C1 and I love everything about it"}
{"source": "  Doing a little research, it seems that its predecessor (AC15CC1) was decent but there were certain things about it that sucked until mods were performed by the owners"}
{"source": "  Well, the AC15C1 implements those popular mods and what you end up with is an amp that's awesome right out of the box"}
{"source": "  I've seen some people complain about the fact that it's a PCB inside and not hand-wired, and that it's made in China"}
{"source": "  So what"}
{"source": "  It sounds very nice, especially for the low price"}
{"source": "The amp's overdrive is very rich, with lots of harmonic overtones the higher you crank the master volume"}
{"source": "  I cranked it to 10 in my living room and was quire loud for a 15W amp, but not window-shattering loud"}
{"source": "  In a church setting this is obviously not an option"}
{"source": "  Fortunately, you can lower the master volume and the amplifier still retains much of that glassy Vox tone, just at a more manageable level"}
{"source": "  You need to purchase an optional foot switch to toggle between the \"Top Boost\" and \"Normal\" channels"}
{"source": "  I've opted to just use the \"Normal\" channel and push it with a Joyo Ultimate Drive pedal, which by the way, is the most impressive $40 overdrive pedal you'll ever hear"}
{"source": "  That overdrive does not interfere with the Vox tone at all"}
{"source": "  I used it this morning with a stratocaster loaded with DiMarzio HS series pickups and the Joyo pedal pushing the amp, and it was classic Vox chime all the way"}
{"source": "  I also used a Boss DD-5 delay (also required if you play in a Christian band - same reason as the other thing I mentioned"}
{"source": ")  Pure tone heaven"}
{"source": "Some have noted noise or \"hiss\" problems with this amp, which were usually solved by installing a better set of preamp tubes"}
{"source": "  Mine did not have this problem"}
{"source": "  Actually, I thought it did, and I was certainly getting a loud hiss out of it for a while before I realized that it was the way I had the amp set up:  As I stated earlier, this is a 2-channel amp (Normal and Top Boost), but which one you're using is determined by which input you plug your guitar into"}
{"source": "  I was plugged into the Normal channel, and didn't realize that the Top Boost volume was dimed and that's where the hiss was coming from"}
{"source": "  I just shut that volume completely off since I was not using the Top Boost channel anyway"}
{"source": "  Problem solved"}
{"source": "I'm amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice"}
{"source": "  I've owned Marshalls, MESA/Boogies, a Laney, a Music Man, and other oddball tube amps over the years, some costing several times the cost of the Vox AC15C1 and the Vox can hold its own with those others"}
{"source": "  Think of it as an affordable \"boutique amp\""}
{"source": "  If you can pick one up used like I did, all the better"}
{"source": "  Interestingly enough, this amp was advertized as a used Vox AC15 with no indication of whether it was a C1 or a CC1"}
{"source": "  Fortunately it was a C1"}
{"source": "  It's a value at full price also"}
{"source": "  Get one"}
{"source": "This is a very high quality strap"}
{"source": " The supple leather is excellent as is the workmanship"}
{"source": "However, I don't like the plastic end pieces"}
{"source": " They are large and -- well -- plastic"}
{"source": " So I'm sending it back"}
{"source": "I'm going to go with an inexpensive nylon strapProtec Guitar Strap with Leather Ends and Pick Pocket, Blackand straplocksSchaller Security Locks - Nickelfor about the same price"}
{"source": "This is mainly a matter of personal preference"}
{"source": " If you don't mind the plastic end pieces, this is a beautiful strap"}
{"source": "I'm a beginning player so I'm trying to make things as simple as possible starting out"}
{"source": "  I was looking for an easy way to get my strap on and off my acoustic, and really didn't want to mess around with changing out the hardware to mount straplocks"}
{"source": "  This strap performs exactly the same function without having to do anything additional to my guitar"}
{"source": "  The ratcheting heads are kind of wide and my top button is fairly close to the neck so at first it was a really tight squeeze, but a little customization of the strap head with a file and some sandpaper solved that issue"}
{"source": "The locking mechanism works by way of a keyhole that rotates closed with a ratchet gear to lock the strap head to the button"}
{"source": " To attach, put the keyhole over the button and rotate it closed"}
{"source": "  Your strap is now locked in place"}
{"source": " To remove it, hold the release lever and rotate the keyhole back to its fully opened position"}
{"source": "  That's it"}
{"source": "  Really, it's that simple"}
{"source": "I'm a taller guy (6'3&#34;) and after adjustment there is plenty of strap to spare should I need it longer at some point"}
{"source": " The leather feels robust, and it was pretty soft and comfortable right out of the box"}
{"source": "  Can't wait to see how it does after it breaks in"}
{"source": " This was a great choice and I couldn't be happier"}
{"source": "This strap is perfect!  It locks on your pins, no worry about sudden disconnects and is comfortable (it's not padded)"}
{"source": "  Highly recommend!"}
{"source": "The jam man solo is an AMAZING pedal"}
{"source": " Yes it is a looper and an amazing one at that"}
{"source": " The one thing that i thought was so awesome was that after you have played something you can save it to the pedal"}
{"source": " It is a very handy tool"}
{"source": " Another thing that is awesome is the pedals ability insert drum beats"}
{"source": " If would %100 recommend this pedal to anyone"}
{"source": " It is a looper that will loop all day and does way more than just loop"}
{"source": " What more could you possibly ask for??"}
{"source": "the product is great"}
{"source": " a lot of nice features"}
{"source": " i am running it through a little Cube amp to practice withand it is not the kind of amp you want to use"}
{"source": " best results are going to be with an amp that allows you toloop through another available channel and bypass any effects you have on the amp like distortion"}
{"source": " if you havethe amp overdriven, then the loop comes out that way too, and the byproduct of that as well on a smaller less capableamp is noise cancellation"}
{"source": "Trying to solo over a rhythm part for instance cancels out the signal being sent from the pedal through the speakerand clobbers what you're trying to play over"}
{"source": "Great pedal, but have a good amp with multiple inputs to put it through"}
{"source": "A looper pedal has been on my list of things I'd like to get some day for a long long time"}
{"source": " Why I waited so long to get one, I can't say"}
{"source": " All I can say is how glad I am not only that I finally got one but that I got this one"}
{"source": " It is fantastic"}
{"source": " Here's why"}
{"source": "First, ease of use"}
{"source": " I really thought I'd be slowly working my way through a long manual, then slowly figuring out how to use the pedal"}
{"source": " On the contrary, I got this out of the box, plugged it in, and was recording my first loops in a matter of minutes"}
{"source": " The instructions a brief, clear, and walk you through the steps"}
{"source": " This manual wins on brevity and clarity in the great manual wars"}
{"source": " As I delved deeper into the options I was able to quickly figure out how to do everything I wanted to do"}
{"source": "Second, user interface"}
{"source": " It's a pedal"}
{"source": " It's got knobs and buttons"}
{"source": " This makes me very happy"}
{"source": " It's well laid out and easy to get to all the settings"}
{"source": " Once you've got it up and running, I strongly recommend setting it up so you can set a rhythm on a new loop by tapping the pedal"}
{"source": " The work flow with this thing is just very logical and simple"}
{"source": "Third, features"}
{"source": " It has built in drum beats that are simple but sound better than just a metronome and help you get in the mood to jam out your loops"}
{"source": " The beat is like a guide track, not recorded into the loop"}
{"source": "Fourth, plays nice with computers"}
{"source": " There's a usb port and you can connect this to the computer with a standard cable (not included) and copy your loops to the free downloadable loop library software"}
{"source": " There you can make some basic adjustments to them and organize them"}
{"source": "Fifth, comes with an AC adapter"}
{"source": " It actually has to since it does not run on batteries, but still, I was happy to see it in the box"}
{"source": "Sixth, you can add an SD card (not included) to expand the memory substantially"}
{"source": "All of which gives you some specifics but misses the overall experience"}
{"source": " The experience for me has been pure jamming joy"}
{"source": " I hear a song in my head, and very quickly have the basic concept captured as a loop"}
{"source": " You can plug your electric guitar or a mic into the input, so you can capture anything you want"}
{"source": "For the price this is a wonderful piece of gear, and my only regret is not having bought one sooner"}
{"source": " I'm having so much fun with it"}
{"source": "I would give this 5 stars for the way it works but a 49 page instruction book to utilize all it potential is a bit much"}
{"source": " Something simpler would suffice"}
{"source": " Really just wanted to record a rhythm track and play lead over it"}
{"source": " If you don't mind spending the time to learn all it's capabilities it's great"}
{"source": "Although there is a great deal to learn to fully utilize this pedal, I was recording in an hour & had the software on my Mac talking to it"}
{"source": " It sounds great with little of it's own noise"}
{"source": " The percussion loops are fine & at least provide solid guides for recording"}
{"source": " I have a GNX4 that I love & as far as this pedal goes, I am just as happy"}
{"source": " I echo the other reviews that suggest getting the footswitch, it does help avoid having to spend a lot of time bent over & fiddling with the small knobs"}
{"source": " ( Update ) The software works well & is very useful"}
{"source": " It loaded right up with no problem"}
{"source": " Memorizing the instructions will be a lot easier once I start using the pedal more often"}
{"source": " That's the only problem with so many features squeezed into a small pedal"}
{"source": " More than worth it though"}
{"source": "Very fun to use"}
{"source": "Comes with a power supply"}
{"source": "Very easy to control"}
{"source": "I enjoy using this to play alone - It is easy to lay down a rhythm and then play over it"}
{"source": "It can be used for drum tracks or to practice a section of a song that you want to repeat"}
{"source": "I just got this thing and have only learned the basics of looping (I've done two jams so far) but I can already tell it's an amazing tool for any serious guitarist"}
{"source": " The reviewer Shawn in PA hit the nail on the head with his comment that he's \"playing guitar twice as much and getting twice as good\" - that's a great compliment on this pedal and I agree 100%"}
{"source": "  What I especially like about this pedal is that it feels like it was the \"missing link\" in my collection of gear and brings it all together"}
{"source": " I'm using my guitar, my mixer, my bass, my drum machine, my monitors whereas before just doing recording seemed like a bit of a chore - this thing really puts the FUN back in playing"}
{"source": "  I think this is the one piece of equipment that will really bring out my creativity and I can't wait to see what I come up with, with my new \"band\" :-)"}
{"source": "I have used the Line 6 looper in the past -Line 6 JM4 Looper"}
{"source": " The Line6 is basically the same as the electronics on the SpiderJam amplifier"}
{"source": " It's a decent looper, but it's too big and I don't need all the guitar tones, backing tracks, etc"}
{"source": ", that go with it so I decided to look elsewhere"}
{"source": "I wanted a looper that I could fit onto my pedal board that could provide some basic functionality (multiple channels, etc"}
{"source": ") and this one fit the bill"}
{"source": " You can adjust the loop volume, switch quickly between tracks, turn the background percussion down (or off), etc"}
{"source": " I purchased the extra foot switch to have a little more control over switching tracks"}
{"source": "The only fault that I've found thus far is that the foot switch cable that DigiTech includes with the switch has a straight input instead of a 90 degree"}
{"source": " This is weird, as all pedals on a board need a 90 degree connection or the cable will be sticking into the next pedal"}
{"source": " To solve this, I bought a Hosa 90 degree stereo connector (it has to be stereo) -HOSA RT"}
{"source": " ANGL"}
{"source": " STER"}
{"source": " 1/4\" PHONE (F) - STEREO 1/4\" PHONE (M)"}
{"source": " I've added a photo of the JamMan on my board and you can find a full photo of the board if you look at thePedaltrain MINI With Soft Casephotos"}
{"source": "One other great attribute of this pedal is it's built solid and is easy to stomp on (you don't have to have perfect aim, just good timing)"}
{"source": " There are a few strange nuances, though"}
{"source": " For example, you have to step on the pedal twice and hold to clear the current track"}
{"source": " This gets the track started before it clears it"}
{"source": " Not good if you were using it in a performance"}
{"source": " However, there are workarounds (like just switching tracks)"}
{"source": " Overall - great deal for the price and, if you are looking to improve your lead guitar/improv, I would certainly recommend a pedal like this one"}
{"source": "What's not to like? 15 Beatles picks"}
{"source": " A super cool little tin"}
{"source": " Rocks my world and back to the garden!"}
{"source": "For whatever reason I excpected the tin to be a little larger then what it is"}
{"source": "  I thought the size of an Altoid tin"}
{"source": "  I was thinking I could not only store the fifteen Beatles picks, but also store my hundred other picks in the tin"}
{"source": "It is very nice looking tin and the picks are cool,  well worth the just under $8"}
{"source": "00 price tag"}
{"source": " I may order another one with different print on the tin, but it is a small tin"}
{"source": "  Just a little larger than a zippo lighter"}
{"source": "I've been playing in bands since 1969 and have used every wireless ever invented and this beats them all, hands down!"}
{"source": "So heres the thing that no one else wants to say"}
{"source": " The thing is built like a piece of s***"}
{"source": " It jingles and rattles and parts are always moving around"}
{"source": " I used this 3 times and it shorted out"}
{"source": " The lights started flashing and it got hot"}
{"source": " I called line 6 and they determined it was bad so they opened a \"ticket\""}
{"source": " FYI if you want to deal with the worst customer service in the industry just call line 6"}
{"source": " Not only do they not know what they were talking about but in the backgrounc I could hear them lauging and joking like there was a big party going on"}
{"source": " I wish I would have never bought this but hopefully I get  a new one soon"}
{"source": " Well see how helpful they really are"}
{"source": "I love the freedom the G30 gives me"}
{"source": " I'm a real klutz with my cords"}
{"source": "especially on the ML designed guitars"}

{"source": "The MXR CSP202 or Dunlop Custom Comp is exactly what I'd been searching for"}
{"source": "For years I played with only a crybaby and a phase 45 on the floor and everything else in a rack system"}
{"source": " The rack systems had amazing studio quality compression and big complex delay boards, blah blah blah"}
{"source": " but these days everything I have sits on a Furman SPB-8C Pedal Board (Highly recommended) and so I've been quietly searching for a serviceable foot pedal compressor, and that is harder to find than I had previously imagined"}
{"source": " apparently they aren't easy to make"}
{"source": "? I've been through 4 (coun't 'em four) foot pedal compressors and wasn't at all happy"}
{"source": " an engineer mixer buddy said go try this pedal MXR CSP202 - so I did - and it's perfect"}
{"source": "Benefits:1) It's easy to match your output gain on the pedal - so when you step on it - the pedal activates quality compression and NOT output volume suppression2) It's easy to understand right away - 3 seconds of looking at the pedal and you're done - 3 minutes of fooling around with it and you get it3) It's quiet but very effective and professional sounding4) It's solid and works exactly like very expensive rack compressionNegatives:1) It's expensive considering there are compression pedals for 1/2 this price2) It's got the 9 volt power supply connector on the wrong side of the input quarter inch jackOver all the thing is a Home Run - you can work around he poorly located 9 volt connection - you can wait a few weeks and save a few more dollars if you need to, but you can't fix a bad compression pedal if you buy the wrong one"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this pedal, after a long process of searching and being disappointed I'm glad I found this pedal"}
{"source": "After trying about every comp out there for years, I came across this, I have a Wampler Ego Compressor too, it is the same quality as the Ego Compressor"}
{"source": "Better than the Script Reissue, it was too noisey for me"}
{"source": "Compression is possibly one of the most misunderstood pedal (or rack) effects for guitar players, but I can say confidently that the MXR Custom Comp gets it right, and makes it easy"}
{"source": "WHAT IT DOES - First, a quick word about compression"}
{"source": "  The easiest way to describe compression is that smooths and sustains the level and intensity of your guitar's pure tone"}
{"source": "  When you play an uncompressed guitar signal, you can experience annoying volume swells if you strum too aggressively"}
{"source": "  On the other side of the problem, you may want to use strummed chords or arpeggiated sequences for a continuous \"ringing\" effect, but find that the individual notes die out too soon"}
{"source": "  A quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them"}
{"source": "  It also can \"sustain\" the notes by boosting the levels of individual chords or notes when they would otherwise fade away, depending on the settings"}
{"source": "BUILD QUALITY - If there are complaints to be had about the MXR Custom Comp, they aren't related to durability"}
{"source": "  MXR pedals, like BOSS pedals, are built with heavy-duty metal, yet the pedal is surprisingly light with the battery removed"}
{"source": "  Unlike BOSS pedals, the switch is in the form of a metal button that \"clicks\" when you press it"}
{"source": "  My understanding from veteran MXR users is that the switch is very reliable and long-lasting"}
{"source": "  In my case, however, I intend on having the thing on all the time, so this is not a major concern anyway"}
{"source": "One gripe with the pedal is the accessibility of the battery and internal \"Attack\" control"}
{"source": "  The pedal has knobs for Output (volume) and Sensitivity (basically, amount of compression)"}
{"source": "  The \"Attack\" knob, which is found on some rival compressors, has to do with the degree of \"pick attack\" sound you want when you first hit the note, and whether the sound comes on aggressiveness or more subtly"}
{"source": "  But on the MXR Custom Comp, you need to remove the back plate (4 Phillips screws) and adjust the Attack know with a screwdriver"}
{"source": "  You also need to remove the back plate to get to the battery, though I've switched to a power adapter/daisy chain (OneSpot) for my pedals anyway"}
{"source": "  So, yes, it's an inconvenience, but with this type of effect, it's not like you would want to adjust the Attack the way you would mess with Tone or Gain on a distortion pedal"}
{"source": "  I consider this also to be a non-issue"}
{"source": "TONE/SOUND QUALITY - The sound quality of this effect is outstanding"}
{"source": "  It is far more \"transparent\" than other pedals I've tried in terms of retaining the tonal characteristics of my guitar, but leveling everything out for a great \"finishing touch\""}
{"source": "  Whereas I used to think of compression as an \"effect\" I would turn on for a specific type of tone, I could envision always leaving this effect on with the MXR Custom Comp"}
{"source": "  It simply makes my underlying clean tone and other effects more manageable and better sounding"}
{"source": "COMPARISON TO OTHER PEDALS - The toughest question to ask about the MXR Custom Comp is whether it is worth the extra money"}
{"source": "  The top-end professional compressors (Keeley pedals, rack units, etc"}
{"source": ") are usually north of $200, which isn't practical for a casual player"}
{"source": "  Boss makes the CS-3 Compression Sustainer, which is the pedal I traded in for the Custom Comp"}
{"source": "  The CS-3 is more affordable (about $50 to $75 new) and more customizable, with 4 knobs on the exterior of the pedal, adding \"Attack\" and \"Sustain\""}
{"source": "  It definitely does the job in terms of adding sustain, and might make sense if you only want to play around with compression from time to time"}
{"source": "  But much like with MXR's entry level compressor (The Dyna Comp in the red casing), it simply isn't up to the quality of this pedal"}
{"source": "ADVICE - While compression doesn't \"color\" your guitar tone the way a distortion pedal does, it's arguably as important to your overall tone quality as any other pedal"}
{"source": "  If you're interested in compression and want the best option at an affordable price, I recommend the Custom Comp at $100 or less on Amazon, or used on eBay, where I've seen it go for about $70 to $85"}
{"source": "  It may not be \"necessary\" for everyone, but very few people who try it will come away disappointed"}
{"source": "  Turn it on, play with the settings for a minute or two, and then leave it on and strum away"}
{"source": "These days on my pedal board I have several MXR Micro pedals"}
{"source": "They have slowly earned their way on the board and eventually pushed some expensive boutique pedals into early retirementThe MXR Mirco Chorus is a perfect \"One Trick Pony\" it does one thing beautifully and simply - and that one thing is create a soft velvety chorus effect with good chime tones - when I activate the MXR Custom Comp pedal in conjunction with the MXR Micro Chorus I can easily copy the Andy Summers Police sound and a few other notable chorus stylesNote:It works great with distortion and with clean compressionI never have to bend over and adjust a bunch of NOBS in the dark - simply control the one speed NOB with my foot (on the fly quite simply)Presently I use these MXR products:The MXR Custom Comp = I highly recommend this very subtle very professional compression pedal (read any review of this pedal you'll see why)The MXR Micro Flanger = Easy, sounds amazing, never have to bend over and fiddle with it, does Jet airplane to subtle wavesThe MXR Micro Chours = Easy soft sounding with good chime - never have to bend over and fiddle with it - simple foot controlAnd the old standard (Ive had this since the 1980's) the MXR Phase 45 - simply the best phase pedal ever made - and I've tried them all"}

{"source": " Works with my Boss DS1 AC adapter too"}
{"source": "I was very excited to try this pedal when it finally arrived"}
{"source": " Just to find out it WASN'T WORKING!!! it is defective, and because i brought it to Mexico, now i can't get a refund or a replacement"}
{"source": "I will try to fix it through some local electrician or something"}
{"source": " Very dissapointing!"}
{"source": "This is the Godzilla of volume pedals"}
{"source": " It is a beautiful, massive, piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as I run signal through it"}
{"source": " It appears to be indestructible"}
{"source": " I like that it has a &#34;tuner output&#34; and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver"}
{"source": " When a friend offered to sell his for $30 bucks I bought it without hesitation"}
{"source": " I now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my Ditto looper so I can fade it out"}

{"source": " If you need &#34;light&#34;, maybe keep looking"}
{"source": " If you don't mind the heft, you will be pleased"}
{"source": "I like this volume pedal because you can beat on it and drop it and kick it and misuse the hell out of it and it still works"}
{"source": " Why that's overly important in a volume pedal I'm not sure but this one is built like a tank and can stand the beating of regular gigging"}
{"source": " It takes up a huge footprint on a board so I generally run it at the end of the chain and to the side but the large footprint allows for getting your whole shoe/boot on the thing and that is comforting while playing"}
{"source": " Overall the pedal has a good throw or travel to it and doesn't suck the tone like other volume pedals"}
{"source": " Good buy-"}
{"source": "I bought this pedal, tried it out and returned it"}
{"source": "  On the plus side, it is quiet, sturdy, has a reasonable footprint, does not suck tone, and it is passive"}
{"source": "  But the feel was not quite right for me:  Even with the adjustable tension - I couldn't lock it in to where I wanted it"}
{"source": "  I'm very used to the Ernie Ball pedals, and I also like the new Morley Volume Plus"}
{"source": "But to be fair, pedal tension is a pretty personal factor, and this might easily be a 5 star product for you"}
{"source": "This is a genuine Fender Switchcraft brand input jack"}
{"source": " It is a bit bigger width wise than the import copies, but that's an easy adaption if using a copy strat"}
{"source": " It works perfectly"}
{"source": " Great price from the seller as well"}
{"source": " If you want a sturdy jack, this is as good as it gets"}
{"source": "Great product, with a little soldering knowledge (really basic in fact), you can fix that noisy jack in no time at all"}
{"source": " Nice and snug with my American Stage Cables (D'Addario is great! Hey, R"}
{"source": " Ford uses them)"}
{"source": "  Great price too, much less than what my local music shop asks for these"}
{"source": "This is an A+ pedalIt's small and fits on a complex pedal board nicely - it does one thing and it does that one thing perfectly"}
{"source": "The MXR Micro Flanger works great with distortion or just turn down the effect level and speed up the rotation and it works beautifully on clean passagesIf you want a Flanger to do any more than that you're just goofing off - mostly I need a subtle wash for flanger work and the MXR Micro is perfect for that"}
{"source": "Simple and nails a lot of the sounds for a working musician"}
{"source": "  Three big ones are the jet sound, choral/flange and leslie speaker!"}
{"source": "First off the pedal is constructed of metal and feels really durable"}
{"source": " Turning the knobs on the pedal reveals the the smooth and efficient quality of the pods"}
{"source": " The pedal &#34;gets along&#34; fine with no interference with the other pedals on my board"}
{"source": " The sound is exceptional and can be adjusted  within a wide range to one's liking"}
{"source": " I can't say it's my favorite pedal, but it sure does play a nice role on my pedal board of various effects"}
{"source": "I am not a big user of flanger and my only comparison is with the flanger that is in the Boss ME 70 multi-effects pedal"}
{"source": " This unit sounds good and is adjustable"}
{"source": " It appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it"}
{"source": " There is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use"}
{"source": " There is no &#34;subtle&#34; setting on the flanger, and so when it is on you know it"}
{"source": " I think it is pretty cool and I mostly use it on my Fenders when I looking for heavy rock sound with overdrive"}
{"source": "I ordered these because I wanted to deck the tremolo on my Strats because I don't really use the trem"}
{"source": " I have a modern American Standard and an American Vintage Reissue Hot Rod 62 Strat"}
{"source": " There are differences in the bridge and tremolo block but as far as I can tell the springs are the same other than the modern ones are black"}
{"source": " My Standard now has 3 black and 2 silver springs but the 62 Hot Rod has 5 of the silver which are a perfect match for the ones that it came with"}
{"source": " Easy to install and works like a charm"}
{"source": "I purchased a set of Fender Vintage Tremelo Tension Springs in order to \"beef up\" the tremelo tension on an inexpensive Squier Jagmaster guitar that I recently purchased"}
{"source": "  These springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the Jagmaster (the loop actually goes all the way around, which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar) and it seems that they are of a higher tension"}
{"source": " Highly recommended as replacement springs, or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars"}
{"source": "At first I wanted to get these to replace the 3 cheap springs to came in my MIM Stratocaster for it was the last thing I needed to change to have a functional reliable floating tremolo"}
{"source": " After installing these tremolo springs (which by the way have a nice flexible tension) I notice that my tone and sustain greatly improved"}
{"source": " I did some research and found out there are other websites out there that sell vintage specs tremolo tension springs for like $20-$30 to enhance tone and sustain on Stratocasters! So at $8 this is definitely a WIN!!!"}
{"source": "Good upgrade, Fender vintage springs"}
{"source": " Use 5 of them (in my case) and they work well"}
{"source": " I would recommend this"}
{"source": "There's no substitute for the right part"}
{"source": " These are great"}
{"source": "  I like having extras around, just in case I rescue another orphaned guitar, to rebuild"}
{"source": "  The springs are almost always missing"}
{"source": " Cost less here, than at Guitar Center, so bada-bing!"}
{"source": "I gave this a 5 star for the simple fact that this tremolo has a bigger block for more sustain and a better all around intonation on any cheaply made guitar, I replaced this with the one that came on my squier affinity strat and let me just say the sustain and over all tone has been shaped on my guitar, it now stays in better tune and sounds amazing, I did also replace the tuners on my chinese made squier as well so that also helps with this tone, sustain and intonation and playing ability of the guitar"}
{"source": "This is intended to replace a MIM 6 screw Stratocaster bridge"}
{"source": "  It only comes with the bridge, no body screws, no back springs, no arm"}
{"source": " nothing"}
{"source": "  That's why it's so inexpensive"}
{"source": "  What you see in the picture is what you get"}
{"source": "But that being said, it a great value if you want to spruce up your MIM Strat"}
{"source": "  The block is HUGE compared to a standard MIM bridge"}
{"source": "  It was incredibly easy to install"}
{"source": "  And the sustain is improved"}
{"source": "One tip which I forgot, do not tighten the 6 screws into the body all the way"}
{"source": " The bridge has to be loose enough for the bridge to move like a hinge"}
{"source": "  The springs in the back keep it back"}
{"source": "  The string tension keeps it balanced in the front"}
{"source": "  What I did was tighten the body screws all the way, and then loosened them one 1/4 turn back"}
{"source": "Very nice bridge"}
{"source": " This was an OEM part so didn't come with screws, springs,claw, or tremolo bar, just the bridge itself"}
{"source": " Not the best but for the price was a killer deal"}
{"source": " The block is full size, probably zinc or some mystery metal, vintage bent saddles"}
{"source": " Would be a good replacement for an older MIM Strat with the smaller block, or other Asian import, or just to replace one that's wore out"}
{"source": " Like I stated it was dirt cheap and decent quality"}
{"source": "Excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic Squire Strat series"}
{"source": "  This Bridge has more strength and solidness than the original"}
{"source": "  Replace the Tremelo Arm with the one offered on Amazon as well"}
{"source": "Key:  This bridge is slightly thicker/higher than the one it replaces on the Squire, so the back plate won't fit back on"}
{"source": "something to mod if you need a backplate, but the difference in the quality make it worth the loss"}
{"source": "This comes COMPLETE with bridge, saddles and full size block"}
{"source": " and it's FENDER! I don't think this is a true steel block"}
{"source": " I believe it's Zinc Alloy but that's Fender's fault"}
{"source": " The company I bought it from, Ant Hill Music via Amazon, is very honest and likable people"}
{"source": " I have nothing but respect for them and bought two of these for Squiers"}
{"source": " They made my cv50's sound fuller with greater sustain"}
{"source": " I'm sure I'll buy more in the future"}
{"source": "I should add it does not come with a whammy bar but your my old squier whammy bars fit perfectly into it!"}
{"source": "This is a cheap and easy upgrade!!!  At about 20 years old, my MIM Standard strats' hardware was starting to show her age"}
{"source": "  Most of the screws and the bridge had some surface rust"}
{"source": "  For about $40 bucks, I was able to replace all the screws, springs, bridge, neck plate"}
{"source": "  This is stage one of my rebuild"}
{"source": "  The tone block on the replacement bridge has about twice the mass as the original which increases the tonal quality 10 fold"}
{"source": "  Don't forget the bridge screws as this bridge replacement does not come with them"}
{"source": "You can mess around swapping parts, pickups, and capacitors"}
{"source": "  But the biggest change I've experienced is with the tone block change"}
{"source": " The Mexi Tremolo bolted right in to all my Strats and even my MIK Squier"}
{"source": "  It went from thin and tinny, to being a real tone monster, with superb sustain"}
{"source": "  The combination of the mass of the tone block, and flat steel saddles, has given me the exact sound i was looking for"}
{"source": "  Couldn't be happier"}
{"source": "These are great strings and were my favorite until I found Fender Pure Nickel strings"}
{"source": "  Some may like the sound of these some may like the Pure Nickel"}
{"source": "I've been a Fender player since I first picked up the guitar"}
{"source": " I've used different strings from D'Darrio to Ernie Ball and now I always use Fender strings"}
{"source": " For Stratocasters I always use Super Bullets and for Telecasters I use Super 250s"}
{"source": " The only difference between the two is the bullet end vs a ball end on the 250s"}
{"source": " The bullet end is designed to give you better tuning stability with the tremolo on a Strat"}
{"source": " I don't use the tremolo very much so I don't know how critical it really is for me but since the super bullets cost the same as the super 250s I figure I might as well get the ones that are designed for the Strat"}
{"source": " Also, these are the OEM strings that Fender installs at the factory so you can't go wrong with that"}
{"source": " I highly recommend them"}
{"source": "Having trouble with my usual D'Adderio strings I decided to go back to the a well known brand"}
{"source": "  These are solid strings that never let me down"}
{"source": "  They go in tune and stay in tune"}
{"source": "  I just wish they had a little bit slinkier feel to them"}
{"source": "I put these on my instruments with the confidence that they will sound as expected each time"}
{"source": " Great strings and great value"}
{"source": "the strings are very comfortable on the fingers and sound pretty good the bullet ends work well with the trem on my axe"}
{"source": "Picks are picks right? Select your material, select your weight, and you're done, right?No! these picks have this difficult to describe pattern molded into them"}
{"source": " They &#34;grip&#34; your fingers"}
{"source": " It's uncanny"}
{"source": " They do not slip"}
{"source": "I wouldn't touch anything but Fender mediums for years and years"}
{"source": " Tried these on a whim"}
{"source": " Not I have piles and piles of picks going unused"}
{"source": " These are THAT good!"}
{"source": "Love these things"}
{"source": "I feel a little guilty because I put a pair on my Epiphone Les Paul plus top"}
{"source": " I also have them on my Fender Marauder and now I can easily swap straps between guitars and I'm secure in the knowledge it's not going to land on my foot"}
{"source": "Yeah you could put one of those plastic Dunlop pick looking things on a regular strap to keep it in place but these look and feel so much cooler"}
{"source": " They use a quick connect of the kind found in natural gas, and compressed air connectors"}
{"source": " Pull up on the locking ring, slide it on and release"}
{"source": "I bought these for my new Strat"}
{"source": " They look great, they're easy to install, and they work very well"}
{"source": "I like the release, it's performed by squeezing with your thumb over the \"F\" and with your finger on the the metal ring on the inside of the guitar strap"}
{"source": " Hard to explain, but I prefer this to some of the pull-style strap locks I've seen in the past"}
{"source": "The only down side is that they aren't as easy to install or uninstall from the strap as the locks that attach with a Hex-type nut"}
{"source": " Make sure you have the strap set up at the correct length (for vintage-style leather straps) before you install the locks to avoid having to rework later"}
{"source": "This is one beefy string winder"}
{"source": "  There is really no comparison between this professional tool and those cheesy $2 toy string winders you find 100 to a bin at the accessories counter of your nameless local guitar superstore"}
{"source": "Pros:- VERY sturdy- Rotates extremely smoothly- Well balanced- Fits every guitar tuning key I've tried- High-impact plastic body should withstand years (decades?) of abuse- Clandestine compartment in handle was a nice bonus -- for earplugs, extra end pins, whateverCons:- None whatsoever"}
{"source": "Buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits"}
{"source": "This is a great winder"}
{"source": " Steel shaft will probably last"}
{"source": "One of these should come standard issue with every guitar"}
{"source": "Unquestionably a top-of-the-line manual string winder, but still the user must careful not to scratch a guitar's headstock"}
{"source": "  On some tuners this might work great, but on various of mine, still sloppy"}
{"source": "  For now I'll stick with good old fashioned fingers and thumb"}
{"source": "The ZT Lunchbox is some sort of new technology that allows LOUD and GOOD sounding tone to come through a box the literal size of a lunchbox! I was amazed at how small the amp was when I first purchased it - tiny"}
{"source": " Then I was amazed at how LOUD it could be and still have clean headroom"}
{"source": " Others have reviewed and written about a hissing sound, but I have not had a problem with that"}
{"source": " After trying it with 3 guitars (1 passive p/u's, 1 active p/u's, and 1 acoustic electric) it remains nice and quiet"}
{"source": " I have been using it as a practice amp as well as in a band setting"}
{"source": "Now here's the thing"}
{"source": " it does NOT have a lot of bass frequency to it, but I noticed that setting it on the floor does help some, but still not enough if you're looking for that heavy metal \"scooped\" sound"}
{"source": " So, I would not recommend it for you metal heads out there; however, for all you jazzers and rockers, the tone knob makes a big difference"}
{"source": " I keep my tone at about a 9o'clock setting because I prefer a little darker sound and it has enough mids to cut through the mix nicely still"}
{"source": "Bottom line"}
{"source": " I would recommend this amp (obviously I gave it 5 stars)"}
{"source": " I don't think you will be dissappointed"}
{"source": "I have purchased several amps over the last 7 months (see the reviews)"}
{"source": " I attempted to move to tube amps becuase I wanted to set up a pedal board and dial in my own effects"}
{"source": " And really, any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes"}
{"source": " I went Vox AC4 and realized I didn't want a tube that already has a defined and limited sound (no fault of the amp - I just had to experience it myself)"}
{"source": " I also didn't want a modeler impersonating a tube"}
{"source": " I loved the Orange Crush, but it was totally unreliable"}
{"source": "Enter the ZT"}
{"source": " Holy-moley"}
{"source": " The amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior"}
{"source": " Nice break up, very reactive to your playing and literally miles of clean head room"}
{"source": " But unlike those tube amps - my pedals can come into play and I can manipulate that clean sound at any level without losing a bit of clarity or depth"}
{"source": " It also has an iPod jack, headphone jack and ambiance (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " make it sound kind of boxy)"}
{"source": " It does not model"}
{"source": " Like the Crush or Roland Cube, it has it's own voice"}
{"source": " I've heard it compars to a Fender Tweed in tone"}
{"source": " I guess I can see that, but it still has it's own voice - which is important to me in any amp"}
{"source": " I should note - an AC30 or Fender Twin or high end 1x12 Tube still are louder and much fuller"}
{"source": " But we're talking $1000+ tube amps"}
{"source": "I don't have the matching extension cabinet because I just don't need it"}
{"source": " It is REALLY loud"}
{"source": " I have a Mustang III and it gets destroyed by the ZT"}
{"source": " At 75% volume on the dial, I can hit my DS-1 and actually make out the notes"}
{"source": " That is something the Vox AC4 or Fender Blues Junior cannot do without getting muddy"}
{"source": " It is fully giggable"}
{"source": " I haven't played live with it yet, but in a rehearsel environment, keeping with a loud drummer is no issue"}
{"source": " A friend plugged it into his Marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous"}
{"source": " Really, just stupid powerful for $300"}
{"source": "For blues, jazz or light rock, it's brilliant right out of the box"}
{"source": " It not only can do medal with a pedal board, but check youtube for videos of the Lunchbox being played in a live setting by a metal band"}
{"source": " It has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility"}
{"source": " I would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video"}
{"source": " You simply will not find a negative thing about the ZT Lunchbox anywhere"}
{"source": " It really is a solid state aimed to take prefessionals away from their bigger, heavier, more expensive tubes"}
{"source": " If you play effect laden music, boy are you going to have a hard time walking away from the ZT"}
{"source": "If there is a drawback - $300 for a solid state amp that really needs external pedals to shine could be a turn off for some - especially for players looking for a swiss army knife for an amp"}
{"source": " Roland, Fender, Line6 and others still have that niche dialed in"}
{"source": "Well this amp does have it's pros and cons, however the cons are overshadowed by the pros"}
{"source": "Pros:1) Small!!!! 2) sounds like a big combo amp 3) makes overdrive pedals sound better 4) sustain 5) big bottom bass 6) HD construction and components"}
{"source": " 7) I can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback"}
{"source": " 8) it soundsREALLY good!Cons:1) yes, it \"could\" be louder 2) Not \"bright\"Now the details,  I have a tube combo amp and in comparison the ZT is a bit on the dull side as far as presence"}
{"source": "Its not that it does not have it, just could use more"}
{"source": " However this is made up for when you step on your overdriveor distortion"}
{"source": " Solos just sing on this amp"}
{"source": "  I feel like my guitar pickups and stomp boxes sound better"}
{"source": " The ampcompliments your rig in some mysterious way"}
{"source": "  I stopped using my combo amp all together because the sounds so good"}
{"source": " I also kinda detect some what of a processed chorusy sound plugged straight in when I first turn it on (seems to go away)"}
{"source": " I know it is an analog path but has some digital modeling processing internally"}
{"source": " It also seems to have a positive compression/pumping release that make the notes sing and get louder as they ring"}
{"source": "Volume?  For a conservative band in a small room it fits the bill"}
{"source": " Mic'ing for larger venues would work just fine"}
{"source": "If you're in a LOUD band, you might consider plugging in an external cabinet as it does have that option"}
{"source": " (darn I meant to test before this review)"}
{"source": " TIP- so on youtube and some other forums guys are making the amp louder by plugging a blank cord into the1/8\" aux input on the back"}
{"source": " I tested this and yes, it does go louder for whatever the reason"}
{"source": " (I'll be getting a blank 1/8\"jack to put it that aux port) A small but very noticeable volume increase"}
{"source": " If you need to be LOUDER then I suggest the larger ZT, but its double the price"}
{"source": " A friend of mine has one and he no longer uses his mesa boogie or marshall amps anymore"}
{"source": " The 12 club ZT is super loud"}
{"source": "I can turn all the knobs all the way up and it doesn't get all noisy or feedback"}
{"source": "1-100 I rate this a 98% gear head satisfaction"}
{"source": " Remember we are talking about a lunchbox with a 6"}
{"source": "5\" speakera tremendous feat of technology to get that much sound out of a little box"}
{"source": "Check it out the reviews on youtube"}
{"source": "PART II -Ok, the extension cabinet option: Hooked up a 8 ohm cab and it sounded bigger and louder"}
{"source": " However do NOT use the internal speaker together with the extension cabinet - Turn the switch off"}
{"source": " It WILL overheat the amp and start acting weird"}
{"source": " I found out the hard way, verified with the manual that you should shut off the internal speaker"}
{"source": " I would assume that at a low volume you could conceivably use both"}
{"source": " You'll know if you touch the back of the amp and its more than warm, but I would not recommend it"}
{"source": "I have been using a ZT Lunchbox Amp for about a year"}
{"source": "  Blindfolded you won't confuse it with a Marshall stack or a blackface Deluxe but for a small, portable, solid state amp it works as advertised"}
{"source": "  People that say it is loud aren't kidding but there are limits"}
{"source": "  The sound from the 6"}
{"source": "5\" speaker requires some space to develop"}
{"source": "  Up close it can be painfully loud but the sound is rather directional and it lacks bass"}
{"source": "  I use mine for practice at home and for low-volume band rehearsals"}
{"source": "  I played it once on stage, mic'd through a PA, but wasn't happy with the sound and switched to a tube amp with a 12\" speaker"}
{"source": "To me it sounds best with humbuckers but I've played single coil guitars (Fender and Gibson) through it with usable results"}
{"source": "  If you are after clean volume you might be disappointed"}
{"source": "  It only gets so loud before distortion (and noise) becomes annoying"}
{"source": "  Players that use a lot of distortion (e"}
{"source": "g"}
{"source": ", Metal) will get a lot more out of this amp than players that need cleaner sounds at volume"}
{"source": "  While the ZT Lunchbox isn't as versatile as some other small amps, it is great for a \"one trip\" load in at rehearsals"}
{"source": "One thing to consider is adding the matching ZT extension cabinet"}
{"source": "  It makes a big difference in two ways: two 6"}
{"source": "5\" speakers move more air and the doubled speaker cone area helps thicken the sound"}
{"source": "  Also, because the speakers can be angled and separated the area covered by the sound is increased"}
{"source": "  This is a big help at rehearsals"}
{"source": "  I point one cabinet towards myself and the other into the room"}
{"source": "  I've tried using a guitar speaker cab, a PA speaker, and a PA floor monitor as an extension speaker but the ZT extension cabinet sounds best to me"}
{"source": "  It's the same size as the ZT Lunchbox and they thoughtfully put the handle on the back so you can stack them"}
{"source": "For an ultra-portable guitar (or harmonica) amplifier that can get decently loud the ZT Lunchbox is hard to beat"}
{"source": "  But if you are particular about tone you might find that a lower wattage practice amp with a 12\" speaker works better"}
{"source": "This is an overpriced item"}
{"source": " That is my only complaint"}
{"source": " There's enough reviews on here that state the obvious"}
{"source": " It is small, it sounds good, and can keep up with a little jazz trio by itself which is amazing"}
{"source": " HOWEVER I have to say I'm super uber pissed that the day after I bought this amp at sam ash for $450 it dropped to about $250"}
{"source": " How does an amp just come down half price over night? I mean, what kind of scam was this company running if they can afford to stay in business and sell them half the price than they were originally marked at? It's like the blue blocker sunglasses"}
{"source": " On TV They're sold for $80"}
{"source": " 6 months later you can get them in the barging bin for $2 at CVS"}
{"source": " This is not ethical business, this is trying to get as much as you can from your customers with no regard to true value"}
{"source": " PS the ambiance was a better feature than newer verb processors"}
{"source": "Edit: Just read another guy who gives it 5 stars because it can be \"used as a weapon to knock someone out"}
{"source": "\" Not sure if this amp deserves the 5 stars it is getting, and certainly not because it can bludgeon someone to death in an alley"}
{"source": " I stand by my logically opinions of this item"}
{"source": " ZT should not have sold this for $450 in the first place"}
{"source": " It inadvertently turned customers like me off to the company name"}
{"source": "Let me preface this review by saying that I am not a professional musician, but I have some experience with guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement equipment"}
{"source": " I bought this amp for a couple of reasons- I wanted a combo that was light in weight, easy to move,store, and carry, and also was clean sounding and slightly loud"}
{"source": " I can get the sound level I want out of this amp without turning the volume knob up more than 1/4, but if I ever want more, there's plenty of headroom there"}
{"source": " It is definitely a clean, noise-free amp at moderate sound levels, and I can add effects through my Line6 Pod Pro if I want to, like more drive, reverb, etc"}
{"source": " As far as durability goes, I've only had it for a day, so I can't say"}
{"source": " It has a year warranty period"}
{"source": " Price through Musiciansfriend was good, I buy everything for music through them( no offense to Amazon)"}
{"source": " It's solidly built "}
{"source": " All in all, a beautifully designed and executed product"}
{"source": " Thanks, ZT!Update- 3/1/12 So far, so good! I've played through the amp for a couple weeks now, and it's great"}
{"source": " Clean, low noise, I'm used to the controls and love the sound of it"}
{"source": " No need to even use my Pod Pro"}
{"source": " I'm now thinking of adding an extension speaker cab of my own design, using Eminence Designer software and an Eminence Commonwealth 12\" guitar speaker"}
{"source": " Also considering the Lunchbox extension cab"}
{"source": " I don't really need more volume but a 12\" speaker might change the sound enough to where I like it, although I like the sound through the 6"}
{"source": "5\" speaker it comes with"}
{"source": " Always experimenting with my sound"}
{"source": " To think some people buy $2000 tube amps, wow I'm not that kind of expert!Update- 3/10/12 I hooked the amp up to a JBL PA cab, and it really rocked! The JBL 15\" woofer in the cab had a lot more bass, so I adjusted the ZT tone to give the signal more treble to compensate"}
{"source": " Hooking up an external speaker is definitely a way to get more volume if so desired"}
{"source": " Now thinking about an Eminence Deltalite 12\" neodymium speaker in a 1 cu"}
{"source": " ft"}
{"source": " As an extension speaker"}
{"source": "These picks sound great, very durable and grip is the best I have used"}
{"source": " My main complaint is the very small size,I haven't got enough room to vary my finger position and get different tones out of the pick"}
{"source": " I find the Dava master control more to my liking for most things, but I still use the jazz III's from time to time when I just want a simple clean pick tone"}
{"source": "I had no reference point to judge the size of these picks perhaps compare pick with a quarter in the shot as a sizing method"}
{"source": "Good picks though"}
{"source": "These have the correct thickness and texture that I want, but they are smaller than a typical pick"}
{"source": " So be sure to try them out first before buying"}
{"source": " One just cannot tell the size from the picture Amazon has"}
{"source": " I wish they put a reference picture by the side of this pick (may be dim the ref image a little so people won't get confused)"}
{"source": " Some people swear by these, but I that find my fingers get a little numb after playing these for an hour or two"}
{"source": " May be you need to get acclimated to this pick before you can fully use it effectively and for long duration"}
{"source": " I won't be buying these again"}
{"source": "The Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III carbon fiber picks really helped improve my accuracy, no doubt in large part due to their relative stiffness and profile"}
{"source": " I tend to drop picks and have tried numerous brands and types of picks, but for ease of grip these are hard to beat"}
{"source": " I am a relatively inexperienced player, and while more experienced players can address technical subtleties better than I can, I have come to depend on these as they have helped me to hugely improve my picking accuracy in a relatively short time"}
{"source": " As far as durability goes, they are the reigning champs"}
{"source": " I bought a pack of six, and I've been using them for a while now and can't tell them apart: the three I've used look like the three that are still in the bag to my eye"}
{"source": " I doubt seriously I will need to buy more for months (who knows, maybe years) as they just don't seem to wear even after hours and hours of use"}
{"source": " I recommend these picks without reservation"}
{"source": "Sounded good"}
{"source": " Warmer sounding than stock tubes in my ac15"}
{"source": " I rocked all night and loved the sound"}
{"source": " Next day i turned it on, my amp was crackling out and wiping out the signal i checked the tubes and one of them was making violent purple flashes before the signal burnt out"}
{"source": " I then noticed that one of my fuses blew out as well"}
{"source": " I changed out the fuse and checked again and the tube was still doing the same thing so i just swapped the tubes back for atock"}
{"source": " Id like to see a real set of jjs, im sure one of them was a dud"}
{"source": "Replaced the stock tubes (Groove Tubes) in my Blues Junior with a matched pair of JJs"}
{"source": "  Much better tone IMHO"}
{"source": "  The sound is exactly what you want in an EL84 and the tubes have held up very well"}
{"source": "  I am coming up on needing a complete retube of my Palomino V32 and I will also be using JJs"}
{"source": "My first amp with EL84's is a totally scratch built older single channel Trinity AC15, which is based on a Lightning"}
{"source": " Initially installed JJ EL84's after reading so many good reviews about them"}
{"source": " They sound great to me (personal opinion of course), and are priced right"}
{"source": " Thought about New Sensor Mullard RI's or Sovtek EL84M/7189's"}

{"source": "JJ Tubes are the best sounding vacume tubes & the only tubes that go into my vintage & boutique amps,"}
{"source": "This keyboard far exceeded my expectations for the price - the quality of most of the \"bread and butter\" sounds is very high"}
{"source": " This keyboard also has tons of neat features - there's something here for musicians of any skill level (check out Yamaha's product blurb)"}
{"source": "To get an idea of how good this keyboard can sound, search YPG-235 on YouTube and check out \"trying out my Yamaha ypg 235\" by JoshTheMusician90"}
{"source": "Since it's also 76 keys (unweighted), MIDI(USB) compliant, very portable and can even run on batteries in a pinch,the YPG-235 could be used in a variety of situations"}
{"source": "One star off for a couple of caveats below - Other than that, at around $200, this instrument is a steal"}
{"source": "*******In my mind, the only \"negatives\" (aside from trying to install the USB MIDI driver/see below) are that Yamaha sells this keyboard without the AC adapter and sustain pedal as standard accessories, and you really need both"}
{"source": " Yamaha should note that a lot of people feel burned by the non-inclusion of the AC adapter"}
{"source": "********NOTE FOR THOSE WANTING TO USE THIS KEYBOARD VIA USB/MIDI ON A WINDOWS 7 SYSTEMThe USB MIDI drivers for this instrument are provided on a CD - the disk I got only contained drivers up to Windows Vista - I tried cheating and using this driver on my WIN 7 system, but it didn't work"}
{"source": " The CD will supply you with a link that should take you directly to the latest driver downloads, but it doesn't - I ran into a lot of problems going that route - I suggest you bypass trying to use the link the CD suggests and just go directly to the Yamaha website to get the latest driver"}
{"source": " Much easier, and my YPG-235 now works fine with my computer, but still surprising since most USB MIDI keyboards are plug and play"}
{"source": "After having played the Yamaha YPG-535 88-key Portable Grand Piano Keyboard in a showroom and loving it, I was torn, wondering what all I would be missing out on if I went with the more economically priced YPG-235"}
{"source": " I now own the 235 and it appears as if I am missing out on twelve keys"}
{"source": " That is, I am not experiencing even an ounce of buyer's remorse after opting for the cheaper 235"}
{"source": " This is a lovely keyboard with more beautiful voices than I will ever know what to do with and extremely user friendly functionality"}
{"source": " Of course, my opinion should be taken with a grain of salt as I will be the first to admit that my experience with other products of this variety is extremely limited"}
{"source": " As such, it might be best to say that, for a novice, one could not ask for a better instrument for the price"}
{"source": "So what is the difference between the 235 and the 535? Based on my previous comparative shopping, I have come up with a few differences"}
{"source": " First is the obvious fact that the 535 possesses 88 keys, while the 235 has 76"}
{"source": " The 535 also includes a stand, sustain pedal, and power adapter, which must be purchased separately for the 235"}
{"source": " While I am unaware of the specifics, the 535 also has greater storage capacity and capability as well as a few more voices"}
{"source": " Beyond these definitive differences, having now played both models, the 535 also wins out with regard to aesthetics in that it looks and feels to be of a slightly higher quality, from its display to the apparent craftsmanship in assembly"}
{"source": "Why buy the YPG-235? If price is not an issue, go ahead and get he 535, it is a beautiful instrument"}
{"source": " However, for those on a budget or for those who simply do not need 88 keys, purchase the 235"}
{"source": " Like the 535, the 235 possesses piano style Graded Soft Touch (GST) keys, which are not exactly weighted but occupy that perfect gap between pure synth keys and weighted"}
{"source": " The feel is perfect for one who is used to standard synth-style keyboard keys yet longs for a little more control without sacrificing playability"}
{"source": " The 235, like the 535, also features USB connectivity and general MIDI compatibility, as well as almost all of the same high quality voices, which separate both the 535 and the 235 from many other models in their price brackets (besides the pianos, the multitude of stringed instrument voices are amazingly realistic)"}
{"source": " While it is unfortunate that Yamaha decided to not include a power adapter with the 235, theYamaha Survival Kit D - Accessory Kit for Yamaha YPG-235 & YPG-235 Keyboardswhich includes a power adaptor, extended warranty, and a couple of other low quality extras can be purchased relatively cheaply"}
{"source": " In my opinion, the YPG-235 offers the buyer more bang for their comparative buck"}
{"source": " Again, the 235 sounds great, feels great and is hard to beat for the price!"}
{"source": "This keyboard sounds good, but the inability to go below that low E is just killing me"}
{"source": " The speakers are good"}
{"source": " Buy a good sustain pedal"}
{"source": "M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action for Keyboards"}
{"source": "I was looking for a cheap way to get some drums miced up in a hurry for this Saturday's St"}
{"source": " Patrick's Day parade"}
{"source": "  I took a chance on this kit, even though I have never purchased anything that says \"Pyle\" on the label"}
{"source": "  Upon receiving this kit, my first surprise was the quality of the case, and then upon opening, I was surpised to find that these were the EXACT same microphones as the ones I borrowed once from a friend to do some recordings, but branded differently"}
{"source": "  He paid about 350-400 for his kit (still cheap by today's standards)"}
{"source": "I pulled out 1 overhead condensor and the kick-drum mic and mounted them, fired up the PA and had our drummer play a bit and was shocked at the clarity of the overhead mic!  We could probably get away with just using this one microphone to mic the entire kit, or two overheads; they pick up everything very clearly"}
{"source": "  I turned up the volume on the kick-drum mic and was even more surprised to hear the thump of a much more expensive mic coming out of this seemingly too-small mic"}
{"source": "  Now, I have a wonderful drum mix coming from only 2 microphones and my mixer has more channels free than I would have expected"}
{"source": "  For fun, I added one of the tom/snare mics and they sounded equally clear"}
{"source": "After purchasing this, I can tell you that there is absolutely NO way I would purchase one of the \"high-end\" drum-mic kits"}
{"source": "  If you are looking for a solution for recording or live sound, this is it"}
{"source": "  I promise you will LOVE the sound and you will be ecstatic about the price you paid to get that sound"}
{"source": "It doesn't seem to be loud enough for a recording device that I have, but other than that, it works as described"}
{"source": "Great mic for the price"}
{"source": " Is it a SM58? No, but sounds pretty damn good"}
{"source": " It's light, don't know if it would handle major abuse, but wow"}
{"source": "for 12 bucks"}
{"source": " you really can't go wrong"}
{"source": " Plus, they throw in a cheapo cable for a backup"}
{"source": " It also looks pretty damn sharp"}
{"source": " Don't see how they even afford to make these things for this price"}
{"source": " If you want a really good SM58 clone, I would recommend a Behringer XM8500"}
{"source": " If you are looking for a back up mic, or you are a cheapo, this will probably satisfy you"}
{"source": " I would have knocked off a couple of stars if it was over 20 bucks, but for 12 bucks"}
{"source": "I don't think you are gonna find a better microphone"}
{"source": "After first receiving the wrong item (not a mike at all) Amazon promptly corrected the error and sent the microphone ordered"}
{"source": "This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables"}
{"source": " The included cable is light duty, but not bad if you treat it with respect"}
{"source": " For under twenty dollars, Pyle-Pro can't be beat"}
{"source": " Just be mindful it's inexpensive because it's made in China, but it doesn't feel cheap in any way"}
{"source": "The mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the midrange and upper registers while the low end is slightly attenuated"}
{"source": " For most singers, it will be just what they need"}
{"source": " The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise, making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production"}
{"source": "One issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam D40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable, the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics"}
{"source": " Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem, but both mikes work perfectly with any other device"}
{"source": " The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue, but it usually only occurs using an unbalanced non-XLR input"}
{"source": " In this case, the unbalanced cable that comes with the mike actually works better with the Tascam than the XLR to XLR cable"}
{"source": "its perfectly done but it seems its not fitting Squire fender guitar in terms of E-to-E string spacing, The Low E string out of range and not fit in the hole :("}
{"source": "Good quality cable"}
{"source": " I have other cables around it and was unsure about its shielding, but have never noticed any feedback or hissing"}
{"source": " Seems like it works just as described"}
{"source": "Good delivery time, too"}
{"source": "This is certainly a step up from the Hohner Piedmont Blues Harmonica Set that Amazon sells"}
{"source": "  I have that one too"}
{"source": "  I thought it was O"}
{"source": "K"}
{"source": ", but I found that some of the harps don't work well and the gawd-awful smell!  Actually it went away after awhile, but in the beginning the plastic odor made me light headed"}
{"source": "Anywho"}
{"source": "This is a nicer set"}
{"source": "  All harps work"}
{"source": "  They feel substantial"}
{"source": " No smell"}
{"source": "  Pay the extra money and get this set"}
{"source": "**UPDATE**  The letters designating the key wears off pretty quickly"}
{"source": "  A nusisance"}
{"source": "I bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes I record, the notes don't bend easily"}
{"source": "if you think your will cheat the big boys harps, youll be dissapointed quickly"}
{"source": "these are little more than toys compared to $40 dollar harps, they feel cheap but have a decent sound "}
{"source": "i dont know if they will last, but to make harp noises without decent bends "}
{"source": " Ill use these sparingly"}
{"source": "Jim"}
{"source": "Nice presentation, although the harmonicas are plastic, they look and sounds great"}
{"source": " Also the price is great, so go ahead, buy it and have fun"}
{"source": "I play harp with some some that I perform"}
{"source": " I found that all of these Harmonica's the note's are off and it's hard to play, I have G Blues harp that I compared the G harp to and the notes were a little off"}
{"source": " The C harp was terrible"}
{"source": " That said the only thing I like about this order is the case"}
{"source": " I going to see if I can return them for store credit"}
{"source": "Let me start by saying that I never even opened these"}
{"source": " I've given it a 3 star merely out of respect for Hohner"}
{"source": " I have no clue how they play, so you'll have to look at other review for that info"}
{"source": "I ordered this product based on the fact that the description states \"Includes a deluxe, red pro type hard shell case\""}
{"source": " Well"}
{"source": " not from Music123 it doesn't"}
{"source": " When I asked Music123 about this, they said \"oh"}
{"source": " well, we provide Amazon with our catalogue, and we leave it up their discretion to input the pictures and descriptions of our items\""}
{"source": " REALLY!!!???Not only did this not come in the red case (which I didn't really care about anyway), it didn't come in any version of this case style (which I was interested in)"}
{"source": " The case that's shown, is the case that's sold individually on many sites for $19"}
{"source": " So I figured"}
{"source": " wow!"}
{"source": " what the heck? I'm getting 7 harmonicas that cost $6 a piece if puchased individually, and I'm getting a $19 case with them"}
{"source": " You'd be silly not to bite on that, right? Well"}
{"source": " they came in a cheaper, nondescript black zipper case, not the one with the Hohner logo on it"}
{"source": " Save your money and order this through Musicians Friend"}
{"source": " It's the same price, free shipping, and you get the actual item as it's described on their site"}
{"source": "In closing"}
{"source": " it's been a week since I sent this product back to Music123, and I still have not received my refund"}
{"source": " Do yourself a favor and avoid them!!!"}
{"source": "If you are a broke performer of harmonica blues and need to get back on track, these will not help much"}
{"source": " That being said, these are not junk, nor are they cheap nasty instruments - there are plenty available that are much worse than these"}
{"source": " Straight from the case, these don't bend well, but do not despair"}
{"source": " Having an experienced player break them in gets one of them behaving well in a couple of days (about eight hours of playing) So far I have persuaded the G A Bb and C to bend enough to satisfy curiosity, but they will not hold up to serious playing"}
{"source": " I do not destroy my harps easily, so am not the most aggressive player out there, but I felt like these would certainly be something even I may wear out pretty quickly"}
{"source": " For the purpose I intended these to perform they are about perfect - with me breaking them in, I can pass them on to my non harp playing relative for them to learn the basics"}
{"source": "  Better use these inexpensive harps to over-blow and squawk through, than the set I will be buying in six months; if the promise of musical ability follows through"}
{"source": " The advantage of the plastic comb is that I don't need to pass on any germs with them - they wash very easily, with no damage"}
{"source": " For the price, you get seven good harps, that make presentable learner instruments, with just a little prep"}
{"source": " Without the experienced blues player to break them in, it will take a bit of patience to learn bending on them - there are many YouTube videos that will teach the method, so try hard, persevere and you will crack it with these harps  - try learning bending on the lower key instruments first; they will be easier"}
{"source": "Nice and thick, the adhesive is very strong"}
{"source": " I have used it on microphone electronics to shield out RF noise"}
{"source": " If you don't have the shielding grounded, or in a continuous loop, it won't work"}
{"source": " If you hear hum, it's not the shielding, it's your technique"}
{"source": "You really need to double the quantity and charge accordingly"}
{"source": " The single order wasn't really enough to do one guitar and I doubt you could do a bass, either"}
{"source": " I used the copper under a clear pickguard, which matched the rest of the guitar pretty closely"}
{"source": " Then, I finished the pickguard compartment and the jack area with aluminum foil tape from my local hardware store"}
{"source": "This is the best thing I have done to my Telecaster"}
{"source": " I had some noise, even at moderate volumes"}
{"source": " After shielding, it is absolutely quiet"}
{"source": " This peel and stick tape has conductive glue, so you don't have to solder the overlap joints"}
{"source": " I overlapped about 1/4&#34; and had a 3 1/2&#34; X 8&#34; piece left over after shielding two humbucking pickups and the control cavity"}
{"source": " The tape is petty easy to use, sticks well inside the cavities and is strong( I didn't break or tear any pieces)"}
{"source": " I will definitely be using this product on my next guitar build"}
{"source": " There is probably enough tape to do two telecasters with single coil pickups"}
{"source": "If your electric guitar is noisy and crackly then you need this tape to shield it, even with humbuckers my guitar was picking up noise, interference , I installed this copper tape and the only sound comin from my guitar is sweet sweet music, no more hum, noise, crackling etc"}
{"source": " overall this was an excellent buy"}
{"source": "Great product! Easy to use and I was able to shield my entire Jazz Bass"}
{"source": " It would have been nice to get a little more of it though, since this was JUST enough"}
{"source": "The picks work well with bass, but they are just too thick to use with ukulele"}
{"source": " The pics also shed easily, making your instrument dusty in no time"}
{"source": "I'd been shopping for a music stand at local music stores, all of them at the cheapest price for this type with a solid backside are $45 plus tax"}
{"source": " This item including shipping cost me only about $23 here from Amazon, and the seller Musician's Friend sent it promptly, got it within 10 business days without any problems"}
{"source": " I had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions"}
{"source": " The bolts aren't as easy to adjust compared perhaps to a more expensive stand, but I don't care about that"}
{"source": " It's not hard to adjust, and most of the time I have it at a certain height, so no need to fiddle with it, but during a group performance, it did need to be adjusted for different people and that was ok but could be smoother"}
{"source": " If you're someone who needs to fiddle with the stand height constantly you might want to get a higher priced one that makes that easier, but if you are only occasionally going to adjust the height, it's no big deal"}
{"source": " Other than that, it is a solid and handy stand that meets expectations and does what it should, for 1/2 price off retail"}
{"source": " Excellent"}
{"source": " I'm completely satisfied with this"}
{"source": "A great item for the price"}
{"source": " Comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble"}
{"source": " You only need to put in the two screws that attach the head to the stand"}
{"source": " Each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand"}
{"source": " It took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions"}
{"source": " It looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands"}
{"source": " Its also pretty lightweight and as I said the head comes off with two screws if you want to break it down for traveling"}
{"source": " I am very satisfied with my purchase"}
{"source": "This is definitely a sturdy and well made stand - I have no fault with it about that"}
{"source": " Solid materials, everything snaps and latches tightly"}
{"source": " Good materials"}
{"source": " Works just like it's supposed to"}
{"source": "I have two complaints about it, though"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " The part that holds the music isn't as wide as other stands"}
{"source": " I probably could have read the description and realized that, but I made the assumption that all stands are the same size"}
{"source": " It's just wide enough to hold two regular sized pieces of paper"}
{"source": " It will hold bigger things, of course, but the edges will go past the edge of the stand"}
{"source": " So it works, but to me, it looks unprofessional to have the stuff leaking over the edges"}
{"source": " The ledge is nice and wide, though, so it can hold some pretty thick stuff"}
{"source": " But if you are using quite wide materials, especially if they are loose-leaf, you will want to look for a wider stand"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " Adjusting the height and tilt is difficult"}
{"source": " To alter the height, one has to twist and untwist the tightening ring (like one finds on microphone stands)"}
{"source": " It doesn't just pull up or push down like the majority of music stands I've encountered in life"}
{"source": " Adjusting the tilt requires untightening and tightening a wing nut on the back, which is a bit difficult to reach"}
{"source": " Unlike every other music stand I've used that one can simply force into position"}
{"source": " The good news of this is, though, that because everything is held in place with wingnuts or that tightening ring, everything stays right where one puts it"}
{"source": " No slow sliding down in height, no slow tilting backwards"}
{"source": "On the plus side, they are sturdy, and the feet can be retracted (is that the word?) so that they are parallel to the stand, making moving them around or stacking them up quite easy"}
{"source": " I love the fact that the feet do this"}
{"source": "These are excellent music stands"}
{"source": "Yea how could a music stand be amazing?  Well compared to those worthless folding portable pieces of junk- this is a godsent"}
{"source": "  It actually hold by 500 song fake book (you know the one- that weighs about 10 pounds!)"}
{"source": " It stays where you set it and works wonderfully"}
{"source": "  NO complaints!"}
{"source": "Bright tone"}
{"source": "  If you have a dead sounding ukulele, as is sometimes heard in laminate ukes, or you want added volume, the Aquila strings are second to none"}
{"source": "  There are other wonderful strings (Fremont flouros, Worths, etc"}
{"source": "), but Aquilas remain the pinnacle of affordability and enhanced sound"}
{"source": "  If you own a less expensive ukulele (under $300) and it came with \"no-name\" factory strings, or strings known to be of lesser caliber than the Aquilas (strings such as Martin, GHS, etc"}
{"source": "), please just try a set of Aquilas, and you will hear a major difference"}
{"source": "  There are internet videos showing the painstaking process of making these Nylgut strings in an old factory, owned by a middle aged couple, in Italy"}
{"source": "Winners"}
{"source": "I only have a low-cost Mahala ukulele so I wasn't expecting much of an improvement when I replaced the stock Nylon strings, (after watching several Youtube videos showing me how to do it)"}
{"source": " I was wrong"}
{"source": " These strings sound much better - the sound is much brighter and &#34;cleaner&#34; than the nylon strings my ukulele was supplied with when new"}
{"source": " The Aquila strings took about 30 minutes of continuous playing and stretching until they settled and now they stay tuned for long periods"}
{"source": " My ukulele now sounds wonderful for such a cheap instrument and is limited only by my clumsy fingers"}
{"source": " I would definitely recommend these strings to any uke player looking to replace their stock nylon strings with something better"}
{"source": "A perfect sounding string!  The crisp ring these strings give is undeniable, they are the best you can get"}
{"source": "  Your uke is going to come with crappy strings, change them to Aquilas!!"}
{"source": "As a guitar player, I recently (march 2013) started to play the uke"}
{"source": "  I bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument"}
{"source": "  These string play good and stay in tune pretty well"}
{"source": "  I will buy again"}
{"source": "Everywhere I go, anytime I hear 'ukulele', I also hear 'Aquila strings"}
{"source": "'  I've tried several different uke strings for both my soprano and my concert ukes, and I've got to say, these are not my favorites"}
{"source": "  I think the sound these strings produce are overly bright, a little squeaky and they don't seem to allow for smooth transitions from chord to chord in my opinion"}
{"source": "  At least for the two ukes I have, these strings did nothing for their tone"}
{"source": "  I much prefer the Martin Clear Flurocarbon strings!"}
{"source": "My newest amp (the Marshall JVM410 Joe Satriani) replaced the reverb with noise gates"}
{"source": "a function I absolutely love"}
{"source": " But then I needed a reverb pedal"}
{"source": " Honestly, there are more expensive pedals out there, but this will do exactly what they do for a lot less money"}
{"source": " Give it a try"}
{"source": " I've been using it for a few weeks and I'm extremely happy with it"}
{"source": "I ordered one of these bad boys on a whim"}
{"source": " It's definitely the best verb it's price range"}
{"source": " You can dial in some pretty lush tones"}
{"source": "It has a 3 way toggle, that changes it from hall, spring and room verbs"}
{"source": "There'd is also an a/b switch that is almost a tone mode"}
{"source": " A is bright and in your face, and B is very lush and ambient"}
{"source": "Using these settings you can go from electro harmonix holy grail to fender spring reverb"}
{"source": "Also has a blend knob, which controls wet and dry signal mix, and time knob that controls, you guessed it reverb time and amount"}
{"source": "Very versatile"}
{"source": "This pedal is built with great construction, though the first one I received was faulty"}
{"source": " All sorts of popping and weird stuff going on"}
{"source": "The 2nd one works flawlessly"}
{"source": " Seems very durable, switch and jacks are quality"}
{"source": "I highly recommend getting a 1spot or 9v adapter b/c this thing drains batter power FAST, though all modulation pedals do"}
{"source": "This pedal does not suck tone, and is true bypass, though I wish this wasn't, as I wish reverb trails were avail after the effect was turned off"}
{"source": "For &lt; $75 shipped I certainly can't complain"}
{"source": "If you have any hesitations on the Biyang stuff, I definitely recommend it"}
{"source": "I've been using it for nearly a year now"}
{"source": " I was going to buy the Boss RV-5 when I somehow discovered Biyang"}
{"source": " I had never heard of them, but at 1/3 the price of the Boss AND stereo Ins and Outs, I gave it a try and I haven't looked back"}
{"source": " The 3 modes are nice"}
{"source": " I leave mine set on hall because I've never liked spring reverb, but the spring setting on this pedal does sound exactly like a spring reverb"}
{"source": " The decay time in any mode is more than enough for probably anybody, and I can say the same for the blend control"}
{"source": " Overall, this is a great pedal with lots of sounds that will suit just about any style of playing"}
{"source": " More than enough decay and wetness"}
{"source": " Seems well-built"}
{"source": " I've since bought other Biyang pedals and I have never had any issues like other reviewers have stated"}
{"source": " I'm not ashamed of having Chinese clones on my board"}
{"source": " In fact, I highly recommend Biyang whenever somebody asks about it"}
{"source": "Well I didn't expect much due to the price"}
{"source": " But trust me this thing is really good"}
{"source": "I've tried EH nano grail"}
{"source": " I own the holier grail"}
{"source": "  I've heard the boss verbs"}
{"source": " And I really like this one"}
{"source": " Save your money this pedal is good enough"}
{"source": "I'll make a video and post it soon"}
{"source": "I just picked up a Pod HD500 and I love it"}
{"source": " Of course a couple days later they announced the HD500x, but it doesn't look like they've made any major changes"}
{"source": " Anyway, if you're thinking of getting one, here are my thoughts, in no particular order:*This thing is versatile"}
{"source": " You can use it in a number of different ways"}
{"source": " Just as an effects board with 8 customized effects, with effects and amp sims, as a midi controller, and as a recording interface, to name a few*Line 6 gave you access to the guts"}
{"source": " Everything is tweakable, assignable, and flexible"}
{"source": " They trust their users to read the freaking manual"}
{"source": " I'm amazed at how much you can customize this thing to suit your needs"}
{"source": " Want the foot pedal to control the feedback level on the delay? No problemo!*For live performance, this thing would be perfect"}
{"source": " It allows you to organize your presets in \"Set Lists\" and name everything whatever you want"}
{"source": " You can change between banks of patches easily and change between the patches themselves"}
{"source": "*While not all the effects are my cup of tea (in particular, some of the distortions sound too harsh to my ear) there are enough options to make anyone happy"}
{"source": " For example, I love the distortion I get from the tube compressor with the drive turned up"}
{"source": "*The built in looper goes forward, backward, half speed, before effects, after effects"}
{"source": " Fantastic!* It's built like a tank"}
{"source": " Metal exterior, everything feels solid and like it will last longer than I willIf you've got the cash and need a solid array of effects for live performance, take a look at these and the new 500x version"}
{"source": " Just buying a handful of the actual pedals this simulates (not to mention the amps) would cost you more money, assuming you could even find some of the vintage ones"}
{"source": " Truly a great piece of gear!"}
{"source": "I've had several PODs and have never really been impressed with their tone"}
{"source": " Right out of the box, the HD 500 totally blew me away"}
{"source": " I know their marketing calls it \"HD\" because of the added tonal characteristics, and it's true - there is a huge difference between the HD series and the older PODs"}
{"source": " I can't really say why they sound better, but to my ears the amp models sound significantly better than the older PODs without much tweaking and NO EQing (although one can tweak the tone with several EQs)"}
{"source": "One complaint with the older PODs (that I agree with) was that one could never seem to get a great high gain tone"}
{"source": " This is not the case with the HD 500"}
{"source": " I've been able to get some great high gain tones out of it without much work"}
{"source": "At first, I purchased theLine 6 POD HD 300because I didn't see the value of the HD 500"}
{"source": " After thinking about it, I decided to pick up the HD 500 and compare the two pedals"}
{"source": " I definitely think the HD 500 is worth the extra cash, even for a hobbyist such as myself"}
{"source": " There are extra controls on the looper, and extra record time"}
{"source": " The wah pedal seems to be better constructed on the 500s (I could be wrong, but I DO remember them being different)"}
{"source": " The dual tone feature and flexible routing options of the HD 500 are amazing"}
{"source": " I'm sure I'm forgetting some differences, but I know I'm happy that I went with the HD 500 over the HD 300"}
{"source": "The drivers seem to work great on both Windows 7 Pro 64-bit and Mac OS 10"}
{"source": "6 (they have 64-bit Mac drivers now)"}
{"source": " The included software is OK - I get the feeling they are still building it out"}
{"source": " It's a bit glitchy but seems to work OK for the most part"}
{"source": " The software updater works great and I've already had a couple of firmware updates since I purchased the HD 500 (bug fixes)"}
{"source": " There is also a much anticipated firmware upgrade coming at the end of this month that will add six more amp models and several adjustable parameters that are supposed to really help dial in the correct \"tube amp feel and behavior\""}
{"source": "I nearly purchased the M13 to plug into myFender Super Champ XD Electric Guitar Amplifier, but I noticed the HD 500 had the same number of effects PLUS amp modelling for the same price! I know the two pedals are designed for different purposes, but for me the HD 500 made much more sense"}
{"source": " I can use it to practice with headphones, or plug into my amp as an effects pedal"}
{"source": " To use it as an effects only pedal, one need only disable the amp modeling and set the output mode to match the appropriate amp setup"}
{"source": " I also decided to test playing the HD 500 directly into aBehringer Eurolive B215D Active 550-Watt 2-Way PA Speaker System with 15-inch Woofer and 1"}
{"source": "35-inch Compression Driver, which may replace my other amps as my primary rig (I get the Behringer today, so we'll see)"}
{"source": "The build quality over the POD X3 Live has improved"}
{"source": " The case is now entirely metal vs"}
{"source": " a combination of metal and plastic"}
{"source": " I can definitely see this being heavy road/gig worthy"}
{"source": " I also purchased aGator GK2110 Compact Keyboard Gig Bag, which fits the HD 500 (albeit very snugly)"}
{"source": "Overall I'm very happy with this setup, and recommend this amp modeler/effects pedal to anyone looking to practice at home (especially with headphones) on a wide variety of musical styles"}
{"source": "Before we get started, I am more \"pro\" than amateur"}
{"source": " I work at a church as a pastor of Worship Arts and use this in my work"}
{"source": " But I hesitate to say I'm only \"pro\", because \"amateur\" means you do something purely for the love of it"}
{"source": " and I feel that way about music"}
{"source": " So"}
{"source": "First"}
{"source": " the models I've tested are far and away more realistic to my ears than other modelers I've used, which includes Logic Studio's amps (these sound almost as good btw), POD X3Live and XTPro (the HD models are noticeably better"}
{"source": " and the fizz is GONE GONE GONE), the original POD and 2"}
{"source": "0 (which sounded the same to me and made me happy at the time), and the ToneLab SE (which I missed for a while, but not anymore)"}
{"source": "I made a few patches for one of my guitars based on having a Bassman 4x10 alongside the Dr"}
{"source": " Z, and it is the coolest sound I've ever made with this guitar"}
{"source": " easily"}
{"source": " Better sounding, to my ears, than the real amps I've been using (maybe because I put them off stage and don't run them very loud)"}
{"source": " I ADORE the sound of this unit"}
{"source": "Oh, and as always"}
{"source": " forget about all the pre-sets"}
{"source": " They're probably all as useless as you imagine they might be"}
{"source": "Now the bad news"}
{"source": " And it's significant"}
{"source": " for some"}
{"source": "First off, editing is clunky like it was on the XT and X3Live"}
{"source": " Just forget about trying to use the display"}
{"source": " Connect to a computer"}
{"source": " Seriously"}
{"source": " When you start from an init patch, you only get lucky, it seems, to manage to coax it into \"two amp\" config"}
{"source": "Next, The functionality of this unit is exaggerated by it's specs"}
{"source": " You will almost certainly NOT be able to do 8 FX at once the way you're thinking"}
{"source": " Why? Let's say you use an XT or a X3"}
{"source": " think about what you're used to"}
{"source": "You start with 8 FXSubtract effect banks for"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " volume pedal (you need to use an effect bank)"}
{"source": " You might be able to use an analog pedal, but I like my volume after my compressor"}
{"source": " so I have to do it in the loop I guess"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " FX loop (only works with an effect bank"}
{"source": " Line6, is there any way you can make this always active in a firmware upgrade? Seems like you could"}
{"source": ")3"}
{"source": " Noise Gate (used to be always available"}
{"source": " don't worry if you mix this with the M13 as I plan to do, though, as the M13 has a great gate)"}
{"source": " I mostly use clean or just barely broken-up amps, so I might be able to skip this"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " Wah (this is always available and active in the X3 and below)"}
{"source": "5"}
{"source": " Post-EQ"}
{"source": " The X3Live had a final EQ before final output that I liked a lot"}
{"source": " in addition to all the other FX, too"}
{"source": " You need to dedicate an FX bank now"}
{"source": "SO"}
{"source": " you might only have 3FX left"}
{"source": " For me, put in a clean boost and tube drive (which I think sound better in this box than they did in the M13"}
{"source": " Probably because they're \"digitally part of the signal\" is all I can think) and a verb for the amp"}
{"source": " No slots left"}
{"source": " What if you need delay and modulation? EEK! I have to re-think the way I use FX in this box"}
{"source": " Still evaluating how that will work for me"}
{"source": "What if you're a guy like me who was using the X3Live (occasionally) as a one-box solution for a dual-voice guitar"}
{"source": " (All my guitars have piezo bridges"}
{"source": ") No dice"}
{"source": "I will have to use an acoustic preamp"}
{"source": " No matter"}
{"source": " I have one"}
{"source": " I will probably dedicate a \"null\" amp to bring this signal into the unit and mix it"}
{"source": "In addition, there aren't as many computer-recording routing options as the X3Live, and the SUPER-sweet ability to switch between two FX chains in one patch (instead of switching programs) is gone"}
{"source": " As far back as my old Vox ToneLab SE, I could literally switch channels from one amp/cab to another in the same FX chain"}
{"source": " You could do something similar on the X3Live"}
{"source": " Not here"}
{"source": " Also"}
{"source": " Line 6, why on earth can't you make the Midi in and out work as a USB Midi interface with this unit? How complicated can that really be?In short"}
{"source": " the X3Live has significantly"}
{"source": " SIGNIFICANTLY more flexibility imho than this unit, for many of us at least, and ought not to have been discontinued imho"}
{"source": " For some of you, it's still a viable option"}
{"source": "You also still might need your other FX!I thought it might be possible that this unit, even if I needed to use my AG Stomp for my acoustic side again (which I'm happy to do) would bump my M13 off the stage"}
{"source": " It did not at first, but after a while, I did indeed get rid of the M13, and don't miss it"}
{"source": " That said, I think from what I'm hearing that some of the FX (especially the dirt pedals) work FAR better inside this box than they do in the M13 when you connect it to a POD or amp"}
{"source": "My favorite patches so far that I've made (which use the Bassman model and the UNBELIEVABLE Dr"}
{"source": " Z model"}
{"source": " far and AWAY my favorite amp model EVAH!) don't leave any room for modulation or other special FX"}
{"source": " (I'm not a \"switch whole patches on the fly\" guy"}
{"source": " I turn FX off and on"}
{"source": ") But after a bit of tweaking and patch-making, I discovered that for my sounds, I didn't need dual amp chains that often, so I have all my flexibility back"}
{"source": "So am I complaining about these limitations? No"}
{"source": " Because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary"}
{"source": " I'd take off a full star for this shortcoming, but the fact is the unit sounds good enough that I can't do it"}
{"source": "There will, at some point, I hope, be a next-generation of this technology which will possibly address some of the usability shortcomings, but I have to say, for this price, I am totally satisfied with the sound!In the meantime, am I willing to trade the flexibility of my former rig for the sound of this one? Heck yes, it sounds that good"}
{"source": " I even love the models of amps I know I'll never use for the first time ever"}
{"source": " And after a few months of experimenting, I was able to make patches that completely worked for my two-voice guitar stuff"}
{"source": " with NO additional outboard gear if I didn't want"}
{"source": " So I've simplified to where I wanted to, and no longer feel like I'm really compromising anything"}
{"source": "So"}
{"source": " started with a rig consisting of the HD500, and sometimes an M13, and an acoustic preamp (currently a Yamaha AG-Stomp) mixed in with the HD signal through the aux input"}
{"source": " I've now gotten to the point where I can do everything I want, if I need, without the additional pedals, and I sold the M13"}
{"source": " I kept a few analog pedals and such that I just like, but rarely take them out of the house anymore"}
{"source": "I'm only nit-picking so that you will know all the trade-offs"}
{"source": " For what I have been fantasizing about, basically an M13 in form and function with a handful of amp models shoved in the box, this is as close as we're probably going to come"}
{"source": " And, did I mention"}
{"source": " the SOUND! It's seriously great!UPDATE! I have learned that I will indeed have no problem replacing my M13 as well, and sold it off"}
{"source": " I thought I'd miss it, but I don't"}
{"source": "UPDATE! As of February 2012, I have supplemented this product with a black James Tyler Variax JTV59 (Korean), and it's a marriage made in heaven! If you are going to go with this product, and if you are looking for a new guitar, check out the new Variaxes"}
{"source": " Totally amazing"}
{"source": "You'll see much controversy about this device if you read the line 6 forum"}
{"source": " My own opinion about this is \"I Love it\""}
{"source": " I play the guitar privately (not live in public) and I have no complaints at all"}
{"source": " I still use it all the time and learn something new everyday"}
{"source": "For any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp"}

{"source": "  The body is 2 inches wide (less than the 2"}
{"source": "75 inches stated for this stand)"}
{"source": "  My uke does not fit well in the stand"}
{"source": "  Why?  The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow, and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke"}
{"source": "  Thus, any uke that is concert size or greater"}
{"source": "  So, most ukes don't fit well"}
{"source": "  They fit, just not well"}
{"source": "I did, and you will likely need this advice, remove the bottom fork, turn it upside down, and reinstall it (no tools required)"}

{"source": "  Not great but better"}

{"source": "All in all, not great, this tiny stand"}
{"source": "  One stand fits NOT all"}
{"source": "  Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments"}
{"source": "  You may think you can bend the lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the Amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all"}

{"source": "I am mostly happy with this amp, it sounds great for my acoustic amplification needs"}
{"source": "  With that said, when I was shopping around for an amp, both online and in person, ALL the amps I tried and read about (both very expensive and very cheap amps) had one characteristic in common, which is missing from this one, and which I thought was universal: it doesn't allow you to connect a headphone for private practicing, I had to purchase a headphone amp separately, wasn't expecting that"}
{"source": "This may seem a nit pick, but considering the universality of this feature, you are best advised to know it is not present in this amp"}
{"source": "  Other than that, this is a great amp"}
{"source": "  I could see myself making a recording in a small to medium venue with it"}
{"source": "Nice little acoustic amplifier that gets the job done with high fidelity and sufficient volume"}
{"source": "  Numerous reviews posted on Amazon, Sweetwater Sound, and Musician's Friend pages and the positive ones pretty much all hit the mark"}
{"source": "  This is 60W mini-PA that amplifies your guitar nicely and reproduces vocals beautifully- if you have a quality mic"}
{"source": "  There are 'package' sets with this amp by other sellers on Amazon that bundle cables and mics, et cetera"}

{"source": "  5 stars just for service"}

{"source": "You probably won't be able to find a carry case that fits this amp, but I bought the 'Singer Black universal Sewing Machine Tote' for just over $20 and it's perfect"}
{"source": "  It fits the mini snugly, with room for odds and ends like cables and mics and maybe a few small pedals"}
{"source": "  With my current setup I can walk in the room carrying the whole shebang in two hands, and that's really neat"}

{"source": "  When compared to other makers (Fender/Roland) nothing gets the consistently good reviews that this little guy gets, and I understand why"}
{"source": "  Recommend without hesitation!  And as with all my reviews if something goes wrong down the road I'll edit the review to share"}
{"source": "  But I expect that this amp will meet my needs for a long time to come"}
{"source": "Acoustic guitar amps have more in common with stereo systems than traditional electric guitar amps: neutral full-range sound (rather than crunch & distortion), high power ratings for clean tone, full range speaker system with woofer and tweeter and sensitive preamp inputs optimized for the low output of piezo pickups"}
{"source": " Unfortunately for me, acoustic amps tend to be optimized for steel-strings and rarely get classical guitar tone right, even with dial diddling"}
{"source": " As a dedicated nylon-string player, I'm always looking for the holy grail of amps"}
{"source": " Is the Mini sent from heaven?PIEZO TONE: I jacked in my Takamine LTD2012 Classical and Hirade TH8SS (classicals with Cool Tubes preamps) and with tone controls set flat and had my ears pinned back with shockingly powerful output"}
{"source": " The master volume was barely cracked but this little guy is loud and muscular"}
{"source": " Unfortunately, that big sound wasn't natural and sounded closer to an electric guitar than a classical: big bass, bright lower trebles, weak mids, quacky tone and compressed"}
{"source": " Obviously, under-saddle piezo pickups are no studio mic but it should sound better than this"}
{"source": " So I diddled the controls and it improved a bit but I couldn't dial in a pleasing tone"}
{"source": " The best timbre with my Hirades was bass-11:00, mid-3:00 and treble-9:00 (clock face orientation)"}
{"source": "Some acoustic guitar amps allow the tweeter to be disabled and I suspect the Mini's overly bright tone would benefit from cutting that little guy from the circuit"}
{"source": " As a point of comparison, Cool Tube piezo pickup tone from my 21 year old Trace Elliot TA50R is much more natural, complex and sustained"}
{"source": " Cool Tube piezo tone from my SHEN-CPK-8T is drop-dead gorgeous"}
{"source": " Perhaps these other amps have additional processing to naturalize and de-piezo the tone? They cost more than the Mini so they gotta earn their keep somehow"}
{"source": "I plugged in my mid-1990s Trace Acoustic TAP-1 preamp into the Mini and was able to dial in better tone, albeit still not as good as my ancient TA50R"}
{"source": " I also tested my Fishman Aura Spectrum D"}
{"source": "I"}
{"source": " and it rendered more natural classical tone"}
{"source": " So you can get decent classical guitar tone if you're willing to carry another box to your gig"}
{"source": "REVERB: The single program digital reverb makes amp timbre brighter and harsher sounding, even when mixed in sparingly"}
{"source": " Wish this amp had an effects loop as any budget half rack unit will sound better"}
{"source": "MIC TONE: I don't normally use a mic for casual gigs but this is feature is handy when you need to mic a friend or blend in a small internal mic for extra ambience"}
{"source": " The Mini lacks phantom power so I installed a battery in my Shure 849 condenser mic, set tone controls flat and was greeted with surprisingly natural mic tone"}
{"source": " I also tried my ancient Shure SM57 dynamic mic with similar good results, albeit that mic needed a little treble cut"}
{"source": " As a point of comparison, the Mini whips my TA50R good in terms of mic output and tone"}
{"source": "APPEARANCE & BUILD: The Loudbox looks more attractive than the pictures"}
{"source": " And it is much lighter and slightly smaller than my TA50R"}
{"source": " If you drag it to gigs you'll find the exterior delicate: the vinyl material and underlying wood are easily damaged by gentle pressure from straps and carts"}
{"source": " It's the most delicate amp I've owned"}
{"source": "FINAL BLURB: My feelings about this amp are mixed"}
{"source": " For value and use as a wee PA it's a 5 star deal"}
{"source": " For under saddle pickup classical guitar amplification it works but is far from natural: compressed dynamics, bright lower highs (even at full treble cut) and the dreaded piezo quack"}
{"source": " So 2 stars for classical guitar reproduction"}
{"source": " The Fishman Aura Spectrum D"}
{"source": "I"}
{"source": " or similar acoustic guitar processor does significantly improve tone, but that's another 2 or 3 bills"}

{"source": " I suspected the Mini was optimized for steel-string guitar tone, so I borrowed a friend's Takamine EF341S and I was right: steel-string reproduction is significantly better than nylon-string"}
{"source": " All in all, the Mini packs a lot of punch for 3 bills and just may be the best buck to tone ratio deal for a novice coffee house artist"}
{"source": "It definitely changes the sound of my Classical Guitar for the better (Pavan TP-30)"}
{"source": "  It allows the the bass notes to have distinct upper note harmonics/partials and it takes away the boominess of the fundamental"}
{"source": "  My initial thought was that it did away with the \"blurriness\" of the low bass to mid-range response and balanced the entire spectrum of the guitar's range"}
{"source": "  Amazing what a $20 piece plastic can do"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended"}
{"source": "I use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there"}
{"source": " It was a pain to take out, too"}
{"source": " However, it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar"}
{"source": " It did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall"}
{"source": " I had to cut part of it for the volume and tone control which is located in the sound hole"}
{"source": " Something you might want to think about before getting one of these"}
{"source": "Let me first start off with the sizing"}
{"source": " When they say \"Fits Soundholes from 33"}
{"source": "75\" - 35\"\", they really mean it"}
{"source": "You are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1/16\" smaller than the specifications"}
{"source": "I know I did"}
{"source": " My friend's Oscar Schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well"}
{"source": " The edges did not \"catch\" completely  and it looks terrible"}
{"source": "My classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole, it did not fit at all"}
{"source": " You could try cutting the edges off the Oport at the fretboard"}
{"source": "The main issue is the sound"}
{"source": "Yes, it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming, slightly but enough to tell"}
{"source": "However, it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes"}
{"source": "Fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before, even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes"}
{"source": "For me, that does not justify it"}
{"source": "A simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less"}
{"source": "Another thing I found out was what was Amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new"}
{"source": "The packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened"}
{"source": " Does it matter? In practical terms, no, not for this sort of item"}
{"source": "I guess that is how Amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies"}
{"source": "- Put this on a Gibson J-45"}
{"source": " It did increase the bass (OK, as that's not a J-45's strength) but it ruined the wonderful clarity and balance these guitars have"}
{"source": " Also took off a little of the finish on the sound-hole when I removed it"}
{"source": "- Tried it on a Martin D-28"}
{"source": " Nope"}
{"source": " The bass got muddier, which is definitely the *wrong* way to go with a Martin"}
{"source": "- At this point, was going to return it, but finally tried it on a small body"}
{"source": " Now THIS worked GREAT"}
{"source": " Louder, focused and projects much better - almost resonator-like"}
{"source": " Fantastic for slide or capo'd high"}
{"source": " That's it's home now"}
{"source": "So"}
{"source": "An O-Port can help a guitar that needs help - a small body or cheap guitar"}
{"source": " In my sample of 2, it made high-end guitars sound worse"}
{"source": " If you can't afford a better guitar, may be worth a try"}
{"source": " But, be careful, as it did chip off some finish on at sound-hole"}
{"source": "Very pleased with this item"}
{"source": "  It really gives the guitar a richer mid sound and definitely picks up more of the bottom"}
{"source": "  Definitely projects more of the sound from the sound hole"}
{"source": "I used it to whenever I am changing guitar strings and whenever I am tuning and intonating my Fender Strat"}
{"source": " The surface is perfect (no rolling away of screws, no scratching of the guitar shiny finish, perfect)"}
{"source": "The mat is just the right size for your guitar when performing maintenance"}
{"source": "  It is firm but is soft enough to protect the finish of your guitar"}
{"source": "  Spills are easily wiped up and do not leave a stain on the mat"}
{"source": "My friend has commented on its bright color - \"you'll never lose that thing!\" I hope he's right cause I love this little tuner"}
{"source": " Works well and easier to read than many of its competitors"}
{"source": "I am editing my earlier review"}
{"source": "  I bought 2 of these about 6 months ago"}
{"source": "  One works just fine, no problems whatsoever, I use it on every gig and at home"}
{"source": "  The other has some kind of short in it"}
{"source": "  It drains batteries almost overnight"}
{"source": "  When I take the batteries out, no problem"}
{"source": "  Tunes just fine, but I am sure over time the battery harness will break as it is made of flimsy plastic materials that surely will not stand this kind of test"}
{"source": "I contacted Snark and Marcy, their customer service rep, sent me a new one free of charge even though the tuner was out of warranty"}
{"source": "  Excellent customer service!  They have earned my loyalty even if their products are not perfect because their service is!I will edit this review later if the replacement turns out not to work perfectly"}
{"source": "Although I didn't purchase my Snark SN-1 on Amazon, I wanted to share my excellent customer service experience about a company that clearly cares about its customers"}
{"source": " I had a problem with my Snark, and the company displayed first class customer service -- exceeding my expectations"}
{"source": " The SN-1 is a must-have as far as I'm concerned"}
{"source": " I had been using my iPhone until a friend recommended the Snark tuner"}
{"source": " SO much easier to use, and I like the logical incremental LED display that shows if you're flat or sharp"}
{"source": " On my iPhone, the app I've been using doesn't always display the frequency when I'm really out of tune, so I have no visual indicator of where the tuning is at"}
{"source": " If I had a better ear, no problem, but such is not the case"}
{"source": "Snark not only shows you with the bar display, but also displays the notes your string is playing"}
{"source": " Much easier -- you don't need to select your tuning or anything first"}
{"source": " It picks up your frequency on whatever string you're on and you simply dial it in"}
{"source": "Great, sturdy clip with a well thought-out foot pad works perfectly with my acoustic and electric"}
{"source": " I usually just leave the Snark on my music stand where I can use the visual metronome"}
{"source": " You can also just clip it to a nearby desk"}
{"source": " Buy this with confidence -- you'll love it"}
{"source": "******************************EDIT: Although I still love this little tuner, my model has suffered a few issues which I will address here"}
{"source": " I'm not certain if it's a design flaw or not, but the little plastic pieces that serve as the socket joint on both ends of the adjustable ball arm have a tendency to snap off"}
{"source": " I think the manufacturer should look into this and perhaps design a single ring of plastic which may have more integrity"}
{"source": " Also, the rubber feet fell off long ago with very moderate use at my home"}
{"source": " The electronics themselves have held up admirably"}
{"source": "There is a problem with the design"}
{"source": "  When you move the head, the 3 little plastic pieces that hold the ball that allows you to rotate the head, just break off"}
{"source": "  The tuner itself is great, but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes"}
{"source": "For some reason, this one just doesn't hit the notes right"}
{"source": "  It looks like it should tune more precise than other models but the tone is way off for mine anyway"}
{"source": "  I have tried it several times and it just doesn't tune right"}
{"source": "  Then I recheck with my other brand and it's not even close"}
{"source": "  Maybe I just got a bad one?  I like that this one shuts off automatically"}
{"source": "but again, it's WAY off tune"}
{"source": "I did like the style, size and color"}
{"source": "but it doesn't work right so it's like running with a flat tire"}
{"source": "I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there"}
{"source": " Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals)"}
{"source": " In addition I couldn't use those on my acoustics"}
{"source": " Snark solves all of these problems"}
{"source": " The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock"}
{"source": " There is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo"}
{"source": " I can easily move it from electric to acoutic, and Amazon's pricing is so low I am considering getting one for each of my guitars"}
{"source": " This is one of the few 5 star ratings I've given any product on Amazon and I rate a lot"}
{"source": "I ordered this from the Amazon warehouse as a refurbished item"}
{"source": " It was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together"}
{"source": " The glue didn't  hold so the clamping base separated from the stem that allows the meter to swivel"}
{"source": " This was unfixable so I sent it back for a refund"}
{"source": " Warehouse deals are not such good deals"}
{"source": "Really love this product; works well, helps me stay in tune quickly, is helping me to train my ear to \"hear\" when I'm in tune"}
{"source": "This snark thing is the cats meow, its absolutely Charlie"}
{"source": " It hears things I don't and tells me whether they are what I want to hear to be in tune with the standard tuning used by so many musicians today to play musical things alone or together"}
{"source": "If you like being in tune, this is probably for you"}
{"source": " It is colorful plastic and is fun to look at even if you are not tuning anything"}
{"source": " You can clamp it on a cat's tail, but the cat will not like it and the cat will break it so don't even think about doing that you sicko"}
{"source": "Great design, easy to read, works better than 2 other brand tuners I own"}
{"source": " only bummer is you can't carry it in your pocket cause its plastic and it is designed to break so you will buy another one or superglue your fingers trying to fix this one"}
{"source": " If it were available in titanium housing it would be perfect and about 400 dollars, oh well"}
{"source": "I suggest you purchase one immediately or risk your status of being cool, hip, out there or whatever standard definition of outside the mainstream you use to characterize yourself in an attempt at being singular without risking ostracization for standing outside the contemporary definitions of humanity"}
{"source": "  oh the peer pressure"}
{"source": "These tuners are so convienient and I have yet to see a musician I show these to who who doesn't appreciate it's simplicity"}
{"source": "I love these clip on ,vibration reading tuners, This was the second one I tried , The first was a Barcus Berry, which worked equally well, They both have lots of features, such as tap tempo, up and down tuning adjustments"}
{"source": " With the Barcus Berry, it was the first one, after trying the Snark, which is a cool name and a lot more colorful, I tuned up a brand new guitar in a store , out of the box in less than 2 minutes, never came close to doing that before"}
{"source": " That convinced me, the Quicktunes I had been using were accurate, but these seemed to be better, and get you perfect, I have heard that they work better on acoustic instruments, which makes sense, they put out a lot more vibrations than a solid body electric"}
{"source": "From the literature it, seems that the snark could have been made by the quicktune company and the company that makes the cool cats pedals, that have been raved about"}
{"source": "Hello, Raving bout this"}
{"source": " I seen on Amazon they are cheaper, I bought a blue guitar only one at my local store for 19"}
{"source": "99, here they are around 10 to 12 bucks"}
{"source": " These type of tuners, especially the intellitouch are popular wih Bluegrass folk like me, The grapics on this are great , no more shaky needle, just a dead on still reading when you are perfect"}
{"source": "Excellent price"}
{"source": " Excellent tuner- with one flaw"}
{"source": " Using it couldn't be simpler, and it has excellent contrast"}
{"source": " I would say it was the best clip-on tuner I've had a chance to use, except that it broke the first time I carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal"}
{"source": " One of the little fingers that holds the \"ball\" in the \"socket\" on the back of the tuner broke off, so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces"}
{"source": " This model works only by vibration unlike the red one, so without the clip, it is not very useful (it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it, but it isn't very convenient)"}
{"source": " I would just super-glue it together at a good angle, but I have to put it in different positions on different instruments"}
{"source": " I've seen a number of complaints elsewhere about this same problem, so I would call it a design weakness"}
{"source": "Despite the negatives, I would buy another if they beefed up the construction or sold it with a hard protective case"}
{"source": "Update 4/4/13: Added back a star"}
{"source": " I'm still managing to use it after hobbling together a fix involving a rubber sink washer"}
{"source": " Even with a slightly compromised mount, it continues to provide excellent results"}
{"source": " I recently purchased a replacement, the SN-8(B), but found it really disappointing"}
{"source": " So much so I may send it back"}
{"source": " I also tried a Planet Waves Mini Headstock Tuner, which no matter how much I try, I simply cannot love"}
{"source": " So I just ordered another one of these"}
{"source": " Despite the ball socket issue, it is still one of the best tuners I've ever used"}
{"source": " For the money, I can afford to keep a couple on hand"}
{"source": "The snark makes tuning your guitar easier and faster than anything I've ever seen"}
{"source": "  It does wonders for tuning your guitar and cuts down on the time to tune your guitar"}
{"source": " The music stores can't seem to keep these in stock because they are so popular"}
{"source": " The price in the stores is $20"}
{"source": "00 and at Amazon, you can get it for half the price"}
{"source": " I saw no difficulties with using the tuner and it was up and running on the guitar and is easy to use"}
{"source": "This tuner is nice , inexpensive and very easy to use"}
{"source": "  It does a very nice job keeping the instrument tuned"}
{"source": "I have to edit my once five star review because twice in a row I recieved a tuner in the mail, and after less than one week the screen goes totally dim"}
{"source": " I Can't imagine this is the battery since that is supposed to last a year and I only used the tuner 4-5 times for less than a minute each time"}
{"source": " It's so dim I can barley see the reading when I squint"}
{"source": " It's only $10 just a pain to wait two weeks for amazon to give a refund"}
{"source": " I'll be buying another one and trying it again! Good tuner, unlucky with two lemons I guess"}
{"source": "Very accurate tuner BUT it broke within the first week I used it"}
{"source": "  The little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when  you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless"}
{"source": "  I will try to get a replacement"}
{"source": " Now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need"}
{"source": "Started to take guitar lessons locally to balance out the DVD's and books, and my teach used a clip-on tuner and my interest went sky high"}
{"source": " (I am a professional drummer with serious guitar envy)All I can say is GOODBY JACK-IN TUNERS"}
{"source": "With this little baby it makes no difference whether you are playing an electric guitar/bass or an acoustic, and you can tune on the fly with the thing clipped on to your headstock all the time"}
{"source": " Admittedly you can do this with with a jack-in tuner without the jack-in part, but the results aren't always that good, and you have to fish around for the tuner"}
{"source": "The whole turn the amp down, unplug from the amp, jack into a tuner, unplug from the tuner, plug back into the amp, turn the amp up process every time something sounded a bit off always soured me and brought down my enthusiasm while practicing/playing the guitar, but those days are over"}
{"source": " I need to keep my enthusiasm level high, and actually play the guitar instead of fishing around for a tuner"}
{"source": "As far as accuracy, it is as good, or better than any jack-in tuner I have (I have three different brands)"}
{"source": "Tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice"}
{"source": "  This device just clips to the guitar and tuning is easy"}
{"source": "  Why you would almost think I know what I am doing"}
{"source": "Like the other one star reviewers -- my problem is that the head broke off"}
{"source": " I tried to glue it back on, but it just fell apart even worse when I tried to do that"}
{"source": " If you buy this, you really need to baby it! My advice is look for a more sturdy model!"}
{"source": "It is bright, easy to attach to my guitar but there are some problems with it being so \"fragile\" at the base"}
{"source": "  The battery was a bit tricky to insert since it is so close to the base"}
{"source": " I like the swivel but it is delicate since it is plastic"}
{"source": " Be careful not to twist it around quickly or it might snap off"}
{"source": " It is very sensitive and has been more accurate than a Planet Waves tuner I currently own"}
{"source": " Would I buy it again? I don't know"}
{"source": " Going to see if it durable and if it continues to be accurate"}
{"source": " Looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way"}
{"source": "I've owned four of these over the past two years and after 6 months of light use (4-5 times per week) the first two malfunctioned"}
{"source": " What I mean is the screen became so faint you could hardly see it and putting in a new battery didn't help"}
{"source": "  My current one I bought in July and so far everything is holding up"}
{"source": " Knock on wood!  They are cheap "}
{"source": "so I guess you could look at them as a disposable tuner but you'd better have a back up cuz they break when you least expect it"}
{"source": "The traditional black box tuners are boring and slow"}
{"source": "  This thing is super responsive to string selection just hopping on the new tone immediately, exact, easy to use, fun to look at"}
{"source": "  There is a linkage arm that is not shown in the photo that makes it even better"}
{"source": "I've used electronic tuners for a long time"}
{"source": "  Most of them that I've owned you have to plug into your instrument"}
{"source": "  That means they don't tune with a microphone but only with an electronic signal directly from the instrument"}
{"source": "  I bought a Korg GA-30 that was about the size of a credit card with a built in microphone to tune acoustic instruments about 8 or 10 years ago"}
{"source": "  I used that Korg until getting the Snark"}
{"source": "  The Korg was durable and fairly accurate but the LCD display wasn't lit making it tough to read in low light and the needle seemed to jump around sometimes for no good reason"}
{"source": "  Still for the money the Korg was a good deal on a tuner with a microphone in it's day"}
{"source": "Enter the Snark SN-2"}
{"source": "  This Snark will tune about anything"}
{"source": "  It will tune either by vibration clipped onto the headstock of a stringed instrument or don't clip it to the instrument and use the built in microphone"}
{"source": "  Clip it to a music stand, clip it to anything and it still works when you use the built in microphone for a guitar, upright bass, violin, saxophone, trumpet or even a tympani"}
{"source": "  Use the vibration setting for tuning an acoustic or electric guitar or ukulele or mandolin or banjo without interference from other sound sources"}
{"source": "  It tunes about anything no matter the notes or key you want to tune your instrument to"}
{"source": "  It senses the entire scale"}
{"source": "The Snark SN-2 has a well lit, clean and bright display that is easy to read in bright light or total darkness"}
{"source": "  The display pivots to any angle"}
{"source": "  It is very light so it adds very little weight to the headstock"}
{"source": "  The battery seems to last a fairly long time, longer than the 9-Volt battery in my tuner pedal that burns through pricey 9 volt Duracells at the rate of about 1 per month"}
{"source": "Long term durability seems to be a question to me due the small pivot on all the Snark clip-on tuners"}
{"source": "  I've only been using mine for about 2 months now and while the pivot part seems sort of fragile I've had no issues at all yet and it still works good"}
{"source": "  I don't think you should drop it very often"}
{"source": "  So far I've dropped mine once with no damage"}
{"source": "  Even if it did break, 10 Snarks are cheaper than the rack tuner I have and the Snark is just as accurate"}
{"source": "While long term durability is undecided I can't complain at all about the versatility, accuracy, high visibility display or the low cost"}
{"source": "  I really like mine and use it everyday on an electric bass or a ukulele or a guitar"}
{"source": "  It really gets around and tunes them all"}
{"source": "  The color is sort of a metallic red, almost Candy Apple Red"}
{"source": "  I ordered spare batteries but haven't needed to change one yet"}
{"source": "I'd buy it again and suggest one as a gift for any musician that doesn't have one"}
{"source": "  I'm sure they'll use it often"}
{"source": "  This tuner is a real good buy at a good price"}
{"source": "  Spare CR2032 Lithium batteries are less expensive on Amazon, so I suggest ordering several with your tuner so you'll be prepared"}
{"source": "I've never used the metronome feature other than to check it out"}
{"source": "  It flashed a locked tempo but I really don't need that feature"}
{"source": "I was using my iPhone and line 6 input but having to plug in can be a drag when you're no where near your gear"}
{"source": " But hands down this is the most accurate, easy to use, and most portable tuner ever"}
{"source": " I use it for all mu guitars, bass, mandolin, banjo, etc"}
{"source": " I bought two more, you will love this tuner"}
{"source": "It works really well for tunings other than standard EADGBE"}
{"source": "  I am still trying to get it tuning in standard, but so far it's pretty accurate"}
{"source": "  I know it can do standard tuning, i just can't figure it out"}
{"source": "I haven't read a lot of comments about these guys breaking, so maybe my wife and I are just ham-handed Shrek wannabes, but we have busted two of these little gizmos"}
{"source": " They are basically made of a clip that attaches to your instrument, a round frisbee shaped tuner, and an arm that connects the two"}
{"source": " The arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into"}
{"source": " She and I have each busted one, doing something mundane like putting it into a case or setting down a guitar on a carpeted floor"}
{"source": "While the tuner works well otherwise (except the low E string on a bass which can be problematic), and the things don't cost very much, it's a shame we keep busting them"}
{"source": " I do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable"}
{"source": " Just be extra careful handling them"}
{"source": "We've been only using it for two days, and so far so good"}
{"source": " I cannot say anything about durability for now, but I'll update this review if it breaks"}
{"source": "====One of my kids has been borrowing my trusty old BOSS TU-12 chromatic tuner forever for her violin, and I finally bought this for her"}
{"source": "There are many clip-on tuners, but I liked the following about this tuner:1"}
{"source": " LCD mimicing an analog needle so you know how much you're off (as opposed to just flat or sharp)"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " You can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic"}
{"source": " Most of the time you want to use vibration sensor anyway, but a mic sometimes comes in handy"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " Can set different pitch than A=440"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " Not expensive (was less than ["}
{"source": "]$ including shipping)"}
{"source": "Upon delivery I tried it on my guitars (both acoustic and electric) using vibration sensor before giving it to my kid, and was impressed"}
{"source": "It is quick to track the note even for low E"}
{"source": " It's not picky about where on the peghead it is clipped on"}
{"source": " No stress whatsoever, indeed it's just as quick and smooth as my BOSS"}
{"source": " LCD is bright and clear, and needle-ish display works as expected"}
{"source": "It worked very well on violin too"}
{"source": " And I saw kids singing to internal mic to check the pitch of their voices just for fun"}
{"source": "And a note about the looks"}
{"source": " From the picture I expected it to be ugly, but actually it was not that bad"}
{"source": " It's tiny and doesn't look like a Fisher-Price product"}
{"source": "====First update, Nov 24 2010: I've tried it on an electric bass (4 string), and it worked equally well"}
{"source": " Still 5 stars"}
{"source": "====Second update, Oct 20 2011: It's still working happily for my daughter, and I bought a second unit for myself"}
{"source": " Fantastic product"}
{"source": "Tuner works great"}
{"source": " Both by vibration and mic"}
{"source": "Only real problem is the fact that the joint between the tuner and the clip is really weak"}
{"source": " Mine broke off"}
{"source": " not even a year old"}
{"source": "Extreamly easy to use, you can tune any instrumet witn this"}
{"source": "  The display is bright and clear, easy to see in the dark"}
{"source": "  You can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration; the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument"}
{"source": "  The price couldn't be better, I just can't believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists"}
{"source": "Stopped working all by itself"}
{"source": " Fresh battery didn't help"}
{"source": "Fortunately, I've another, plus a Korg and an two Intellitouch"}
{"source": " (I've 2 fiddles and 3 guitars)The Intellitouch is simply \"champion!\""}
{"source": "Got this for a 15 year old learning guitar"}
{"source": "  They thought the guitar was fine before the tuner"}
{"source": "  My, how things change when you can see what is really going on"}
{"source": "  Recommended"}
{"source": "My mother \"plays\" the guitar (I am a banjo/mandolin player), and the Snark SN-2 came in the mail while I was gone for 5 days"}
{"source": "  She opened it up, got curious and tried it out on her guitar that prolly hasn't been in tune since"}
{"source": " I dunno"}
{"source": " and she LOVED it!  lulz  This little thing really is my absolute favorite instrument accessory, both a vibrational and an internal mic pickup"}
{"source": "  I was using my old Korg chromatic for those times I wanted to see if I was singing the correct note"}
{"source": " and was actually pleasantly surprised that the Snark SN-2 had a mic"}
{"source": "  One less accessory in the little bag now"}
{"source": "  :DI am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function, however"}
{"source": " its neat as you can play without the TICK TOCK distraction and still look up once in awhile to see if you are on beat, but as an actual instructional tool for keeping tempo"}
{"source": " mmm, I would still highly recommend using an audible metronome"}
{"source": "Side note, if you have friends/family that play a string instrument, be aware your Snark SN-2 *WILL* be making the rounds"}
{"source": "This is a very versatile tuner!  I use it all the time to check my instruments, and keep things sounding good"}
{"source": "  Highly recommend this product"}
{"source": "Price is Right for entry level"}
{"source": " Using as a backup or on my mixer when using my higher quality short stand during recordings"}
{"source": " The Mic mount was a PLUS, using it for one Karaoke \"Cheap Mics\" It is just pop-riveted on so a Bit LOOSE, but could improve with a little 2 part epoxy"}
{"source": " Only thing keeping it from 5 stars! Still for the money a great buy"}
{"source": "It is so small that it cannot hold all mics"}
{"source": " If you have a big lopsided kick drum mic  with a skinny neck and akward COG(AKG D112), this stand will not be able to hold it up"}
{"source": " It can however hold up the Audix D6 and it can hold an SM 57 up to a guitar cab if its the right height"}
{"source": " I love this because it has allowed me to mic things in really really tight spaces"}
{"source": " I would never have had room to use full sized instrument mic stands in some of the tiny stages I have seen this summer"}
{"source": " This thing takes up very little real estate, I have put this thing in the pocket of my jeans before!"}
{"source": "I use this short stand for mic'ing my guitar amp cabinet"}
{"source": " It is pretty small and on the edge of \"light duty\" but I wouldn't call it cheap or crappy"}
{"source": " The adjustable features work well and feel like they will hold up reasonably"}
{"source": " I don't use it for gig'ing so it isn't getting beat on but it seems to be a pretty good mic stand and the price was great"}
{"source": " I also purchased a \"musician's gear\"  [ http://www"}
{"source": "amazon"}
{"source": "com/gp/product/B0018TC7BW/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title ]similar mic stand which was a few dollars more, I think I prefer the musician's gear unit becuase it's a bit beefier than this one but I still like this stand and it was a great value"}
{"source": " This unit folds up particularly compact which migh be and advantage for some"}
{"source": " Both are perfect for home recording and practice studios, likely even hold up to some gig'ing"}
{"source": "I much prefer curly cable as they keep the slack up off the floor and help prevent nasty little tumbles and equipment spills due to general clumsiness"}
{"source": " These cables are no different"}
{"source": " They may not be the nicest looking cables ever, but for this price you can't shake a stick at it"}
{"source": "The connectors are injection molded so theres no easy unscrew and re-solder when the time comes, but hey for a budget curly cable I am not complaining"}
{"source": " I'll just nip the ends off if I need to replace them later"}
{"source": " The cable seems to be of good quality; I'm guessing it's about 24 gauge wire and has a nice bounciness to it"}
{"source": " I have not yet noticed any degradation of tone so it's probably fairly well-shielded"}
{"source": " With the right-angled jack on one end it ensures a low profile so I don't easily kick the cable out of the pedal and will probably help it last longer with the reduced cable strain on that end"}
{"source": " That's more than I thought I had to say about a cheap, but good, cable"}
{"source": "these are great for people when practicing they are cheap and sound good"}
{"source": "they are almost as good sounding as monster cables but just a little bit worse"}
{"source": " i actually dont use monster cables anymore i like this one more and for the price how can i complain"}
{"source": "a tip for people new to guitar, cable that have a angled jack are best for when you sit and play because when you plug a straight one into the guitar jack and you sit you actually bend the wire, and what happens is the wire actually have to be bent in a certain way to work and eventually wont work at all,just like headphone wires"}
{"source": "but when you plugged the angled one into the guitar its all good and no problems"}
{"source": "GOOD POINTS: [1] This cable, unlike many other coiled cables I've tried, does NOT add noise when it's moved"}
{"source": " I swung it about quite a bit while playing through it, and it made no noise at all"}
{"source": " [2] It also has good plugs in that the indentation on the male plug provides a generous gap, making it easy for the female jack to connect to the male end"}
{"source": " As a result, the cable does not slip out TOO easily; the connection between jack and plug is quite secure"}
{"source": " BAD POINTS: [1] The package it comes in says it's a 20-foot cable"}
{"source": " Not even close! Holding it up by one end, with the other end simply dangling (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", not plugged into anything), I saw that it measures 3 feet (again, that's when it's not stretched); when not stretched at all, it measures just 3 feet"}
{"source": " Of course, this would not result in 20 feet when it's stretched"}
{"source": " Sure enough, when I plugged it into an amp, I could COMFORTABLY stretch it to only about 6"}
{"source": "5 feet"}
{"source": " This might not bother you; it doesn't bother me since I didn't want the extra cable length"}
{"source": " But if you need anything like a 20-foot cable, you're going to have to get something else"}
{"source": " [2] Finally, a minor point: If you're using this on a guitar with a Strat-style jack, this cable will be a bit---but only a bit---more difficult than most cables to unplug from the guitar, no matter which end you plug into your guitar, because there's not much to grip when unplugging"}
{"source": " Of course, if you pull on the cable itself, instead of one of the ends, you'll ruin it in no time"}
{"source": " Overall, I am quite happy with this cable and would buy more, since I don't need more than the length it has, and since it makes no noise"}
{"source": "Thank goodness Amazon doesn't sell this gadget for the forty-dollar retail price tag"}
{"source": "I just got mine today and tried it out"}
{"source": " The sound quality complaints are no joke"}
{"source": " There is a constant hiss and any slight movement of the iRig or iPhone while playing will create a loud static noise"}
{"source": " Don't know if a better quality jack on the iRig would've solved this problem or not"}
{"source": "But if you're willing to tweak with the input and output line levels as well as your speaker or headphone volume settings, you may find a happy medium that you can live with"}
{"source": "Still, the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool"}
{"source": " If I find the need to really use one of these I'll probably spring for something that plugs into the iPhone dock connector"}
{"source": " Until then this'll be a fun toy to play with"}
{"source": "March 29, 2012 - Just a quick addendum to my initial review"}
{"source": " I've since discovered the noise filter in the AmpliTube iPhone app, and wow, what a difference! It sounds much, much better now"}
{"source": " No more hiss, no more static"}
{"source": "I was very disappointed when I tried this thing"}
{"source": " I bought it so that I could play along the songs that I have on my Ipod but the guitar sounds really distorted (don't thing I haven't tried changing the settings on the effects/amps)"}
{"source": " Also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables"}
{"source": " If you want to record what you play, you're probably better off saving some money and buying the Boss recorder or something like that"}
{"source": " Being able to slow the songs down is somewhat useful but forget about playing along to it, it sounds so horrible is unbearable"}

{"source": " Against my better judgement I brought the Slash Amplitube app just to satisfy my curiosity and let me tell you is much much better"}
{"source": " I guess the tittle of this review stands, the free app sucks but if you pay for it it'll be actually useful"}
{"source": " I added two stars to the product"}
{"source": "I've used 4 different brands of clip-on tuners to tune my Classical guitars and electric basses, but this tuner is the most accurate"}
{"source": " It captures the note immediately without errors, whether the low E on an electric bass guitar or the high E on my classical guitar"}
{"source": " It is fast enough to use real time during intonation practice/training on fretless bass"}
{"source": " It works flawlessly on solid body and acoustic instruments"}
{"source": " Takes a little getting used to but simply, if the rings spin clockwise, the note is sharp; if the rings spin counterclockwise the note is flat"}
{"source": "  If you can afford it, the Peterson is the best clip-on tuner out there"}
{"source": "This is my first strobe tuner"}
{"source": "  So far it has been wonderful for intonation/initial setups"}
{"source": "  It may be a little bit of overkill for average string tuning but one thing is for sure; it is accurate!  The only thing I don't like is that the housing feels \"cheap"}
{"source": "\"  Like plasticy cheap"}
{"source": "  It was packaged in an attractive tin (which is not good for fitting in the guitar case) and I wouldn't take it on the road but it most definitely will be on my bench as the go-to tuner"}
{"source": "It is easy to use, though the precision requires very gentle turns of your tuner"}
{"source": "UPDATE:The battery life is short as noted by another reviewer"}
{"source": " Since I only use it for initial setups and intonations I remove the battery when I place it back in its tin"}
{"source": " There's a little storage slot for an extra battery in the the case which is useful"}
{"source": "I really like this tuner"}
{"source": "  it works very well"}
{"source": "  once you understand what you are supposed to be looking for on the tuner (ie"}
{"source": ", the moving black squares to no longer move),  then tuning is a simple and accurate thing"}
{"source": "  it works great on all of my guitars, acoustic and electric"}
{"source": "  comes in a very cool metal box which protects it nicely when traveling or not using it"}
{"source": "  it cause a few bucks, but I think it is so much better than the other less expensive clip ons, that it is worth it"}
{"source": "As my reviews demonstrate, I'm a sucker for a new tuner"}
{"source": "  Peterson has an excellent reputation for its strobe tuners"}
{"source": " I'd even tried one, once, but decided it wasn't the sort of thing to be carrying around to jams"}
{"source": "  So, when I saw that Peterson had introduced a clip on tuner, I couldn't help but salivate"}
{"source": "\"Awkward\" is a relative term, but I don't feel it's a disservice to use it here"}
{"source": "  The typical clip-on tuner has an LCD \"needle\""}
{"source": " When the needle is dead center, the string is tuner"}
{"source": "  If it's short of center, the string is flat"}
{"source": "  If it's past center, the string is sharp"}
{"source": "  The SC-1 has two sets of rings that appear to rotate, analogous to what a strobe might look like"}
{"source": "  A string is in tune when the rings stop rotating"}
{"source": "  I found that with the way the sound of strings decays, it's difficult to get the rings to stop spinning, even in the SC-1's sustain mode"}
{"source": "  (I've already returned the tuner"}
{"source": "  Otherwise, I just realized, it would have been a big help to have done a short video of tuning a guitar with the SC-1 and with a Zoid or Intelli"}
{"source": ")The SC-1 also boasts a \"sweetened\" mode for tuning guitars"}
{"source": "  However, when  I tuned my lounging-at-home guitar this way, I found the needle was dead center on every string on my Intelli tuner"}
{"source": " (For those who've read my other reviews, my preferred Zoid was in the case with my favorite guitar"}
{"source": ")It may well be, and others may report, that the SC-1's feature set make it ideal for other situations"}
{"source": "  However, if you main purpose is to keep a guitar in tune, then, with the SC-1 costing more than THREE ZoidsZoid Z-1000 Clip-On Tuner by Sabineor FOUR IntellisIntelli IMT500 Clip-on Chromatic Digital Tuner for Strings, I recommend that you consider the Zoid or Intelli"}
{"source": "All that needs to be said is that  &#34; It's a Peterson &#34; Just the best Tuner's ever"}
{"source": " I also use one on My Pedal Board, Wouldn't use anything else !!!!!!"}
{"source": "Peterson makes some of the best and most accurate tuners and their high end strobe tuners are a must for the professional guitar repair shop allowing for accurate intonation and set ups"}
{"source": " This tuner is accurate and I have even successfully set the intonation on a couple of my instruments using it (although it is not intended for this purpose)"}
{"source": " However I purchased it for the intention of taking it along to gigs in my guitar case"}
{"source": " Unfortunately, due to the flimsy plastic construction I don't feel that it is up to the task and it would only be a matter of time before it gets broken if taken out of the house or on the road"}
{"source": " Far better off purchasing a cheap Snark tuner that if lost or broken wouldn't be a big deal to replace and is accurate enough for most peoples use"}
{"source": "USB Condenser mics and more specifically this one are great for doing Podcasts and for portability"}
{"source": " The reason being is that they are condensers for one, and the other is that this mic has a built in interface"}
{"source": " An interface is a glorified sound card with both a microphone preamp and (Analogue to digital, and digital to analogue) AD/DA converters"}
{"source": " Of course most any standalone interface is going to give you way more desirable results than just plugging a microphone into the mic jack on your computer; way, way better"}
{"source": " So this MXL Studio 24 USB even with the built in interface is going to give you quality far exceeding your computers potential"}
{"source": " So instead of having to carry a separate interface around with you having this all in one MXL Studio 24 USB all you need is a laptop with a USB input and you"}
{"source": "There are limitations though with a USB mic with the main one being that you can only record the microphone without being able to plug in any instruments"}
{"source": " (Although you could record instruments using this microphone and that way be able to layer more tracks in your DAW"}
{"source": ") Recording multiple tracks at the same time is not possible with this mic unless you are recording the same thing in multiple tracks"}
{"source": "The really good thing about this mic is that you are getting some pretty decent quality for the money"}
{"source": " So for anything that you need to do using a microphone as your one and only sound device it is ideal, quick, easy, and affordable"}
{"source": "One of the problems with using it in Pro Tools, or any DAW is that you can only use one interface at a time"}
{"source": " Since the mic has a built in interface you can't use any other"}
{"source": " Even in Garage Band for MAC, although they have the ability to use more than one interface because you can toggle between the two but not be able to use two simultaneously"}
{"source": " So in plain words if you are planning studio capabilities a USB mic is not what you need"}
{"source": " I have a couple of MXL condenser mics that I bought for my studio"}
{"source": " I have the MXL V57M which was their early offering but is no longer made and I have found the MXL V250 to be comparable to that one"}
{"source": " Some other MXL's like the 990 are muddy in the bottom end"}
{"source": " When bottom fishing for a good/decent condenser mic some of the CAD offerings are also top sellers"}
{"source": "When using the MXL 24 USB in Win 7 no driver download is necessary"}
{"source": " If your mic comes without the included CD you can download the free MXL Studio Control app which includes input controls for microphone gain and an adjustable high pass filter"}
{"source": " It also has a nose gate with adjustable threshold"}
{"source": " There are also output adjustments as well"}
{"source": "One other thing that is unique about USB mics working with your PC is that they are dependent of course on your PC"}
{"source": " So I had the hardest time trying to figure out what was wrong when I couldn't get the output from my PC or into the free Reaper DAW recording software (free 60 day trial) also downloadable from MXL"}
{"source": " So I finally gave up after trying various input options etc and discovered through the troubleshooter in Windows 7 accessible via Control panel, and then \"Sound\" and then type \"Troubleshooter\" into the search box in the upper right corner"}
{"source": " The answer was that my mic input volume inside of Windows was down to zero"}
{"source": " I moved the slider up and bang it worked"}
{"source": "So for sound quality you are getting decent quality for the price and it has a built in interface and even an output jack you can plug your headphones into; it's a mini jack like you have on your computer"}
{"source": " So with just your laptop and this mic you are set for pod-casting, or any other function that requires only one microphone and no other channels"}
{"source": " This mic comes with a desktop stand which is an indication of its intended purpose as opposed to a studio vocal or instrument mic"}
{"source": "I occasionally give radio interviews and participate in telephone conference calls"}
{"source": " I'm also toying with the idea of eventually doing a podcast and/or recording audiobooks"}
{"source": " When I first opened this package I was struck how sturdy and professional-looking this microphone was"}
{"source": " Even the case impressed me"}
{"source": " The travel case is elegant and beautifully designed all by itself"}
{"source": "The microphone was easy to put together and place on its stand"}
{"source": " One thing I didn't like was having Reaper pushed on me"}
{"source": " I've successfully used Audacity for years, and, even more important, it's a free program that does everything I ask of it"}
{"source": " I installed Reaper and immediately disliked its interface"}
{"source": " It also repeatedly yelled at me about how if I used it past 60 days it was going to make me pay for it"}
{"source": " I didn't like its tone, so I uninstalled it"}
{"source": " MXL really should reconsider its association with Reaper"}
{"source": "I tested the Microphone on a phone call using Google Voice"}
{"source": " Everyone I spoke with said the voice quality was superior to the cheaper mike I've been using"}
{"source": " I also tested it with Audacity in recording my voice"}
{"source": " Again, I was very happy with the results"}
{"source": "The packaging materials said that I should have received a CD in the package"}
{"source": " I looked everywhere but couldn't find it; apparently I need it for something called a custom Grahic User Interface (GUI)"}
{"source": " I emailed technical support "}
{"source": " and I'm still waiting to hear back"}
{"source": " Not cool"}
{"source": "So Reaper and customer service are definite negatives, but the equipment itself is outstanding"}
{"source": "This microphone only records in mono, and if you're unsure of what that means, it doesn't capture sound to it's full potential, and doesn't create a left/right feeling"}
{"source": " All recordings sound like it is coming from just one direction, and though this is useful for some things such as podcasts, I wouldn't recommend it to a musician looking for great voice quality"}
{"source": " It looks nice, and it would b e great for a Skype call, but it really wasn't what I was expecting when i opened the box up and tested it out"}
{"source": " If you're looking for a mono microphone, this is however a very good mono microphone"}
{"source": "This power supply is unbelieveble versatile"}
{"source": " when i first saw this i believed it was only for 6 pedals but it turns out it can power up A LOT pedals better than any power supply out there"}
{"source": " this power up my 12 pedals i got in my pedal board and i can even power more"}
{"source": " im buying 3 more and it will work, only with this!! Thats why i say this is the best on the world!"}
{"source": "its a must have for guitarist with multi effects"}
{"source": "  it comes with a range of wires but I did not like that you camt use the last two ports together (the ac ports)"}
{"source": "  other than that it good"}
{"source": "With this power supply you can offer to your pedals 9Vdc, 12Vdc, 18Vd or 12Vac"}
{"source": " I'm using 8 pedals conected to this power supply, and I don't have any kind of noise or hum"}
{"source": "I love this guitar!! It has a terrific sound and it's GORGEOUS!  The gig bag, although not padded, works very well and is well made"}
{"source": "  The pockets are very handy"}
{"source": "  All in all"}
{"source": "one of the best purchases I've made for the money"}
{"source": "  VERY HAPPY!!"}
{"source": "This is an amazing guitar"}
{"source": " I couldn't put it down, I have experience playing really, really expensive guitars"}
{"source": " My $500 \"beater\" acoustic I was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all, I couldn't imagine what I would b getting for $90"}
{"source": " By was I wrong"}
{"source": " It's my best acoustic currently! This thing sounds like, sustains, and holds its' own tune like a similar $2000"}
{"source": "00+ Martin model and that's ZERO exaggeration! Get it and see, you will be blown away"}
{"source": " I bought a second one"}
{"source": " I just wish I had found this guitar sooner"}
{"source": "This strap is comfortable, has plenty of room to expand it to fit, and is just wide enough to continue to be comfy around you"}
{"source": "  Perfect for uke or mandolin or banjolele, and even the extra thin travel ukes"}
{"source": "  I really like it!"}
{"source": "I have had trouble finding uke sized straps and have often had to use the larger guitar straps"}
{"source": " This fits just right and looks just right"}
{"source": "  It's well made and not too expensive"}
{"source": "  I just wish I had found them before buying all those guitar straps"}
{"source": "I ordered this strap to use with both my concert & tenor ukes"}
{"source": "  It just works"}
{"source": "I already owned a ukulele leash-type thing that required me to poke my arm through a loop at one end and then put a hook in the uke's sound hole or tie it off to the head"}
{"source": " The problem, of course is that if you just let go of the uke it still falls away from your body (sometimes disastrously)"}
{"source": "  With a strap like this one, you can completely let go of your uke & it stays perfectly in place"}
{"source": " Chord changes & strumming become easier when you don't have to concentrate so much on clamping the thing to your body or supporting the neck"}
{"source": "This is a nice size strap, not to wide not to narrow"}
{"source": "  The length is easily adjusted to work with a variety of uke (and uke player) sizes"}
{"source": " It does require at least one button on the bottom of the uke"}
{"source": " The other end of the strap can be tied to the head with the included string if you like to do it that way"}
{"source": " In my case I installed two buttons - more convenient and the strap doesn't interfere with my chord-hand"}
{"source": " Here are the buttons I used:Strap ButtonsIf the thought of installing buttons makes you hesitant, put your fears aside"}
{"source": " It can be done quickly & easily and the end result is well worth it"}
{"source": " Here's an entertaining how-to video that will walk you through it: ("}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "I looked at a lot of different straps before ordering this one"}
{"source": "  I hesitated a bit because I couldn't find anywhere that they specified the width, but it was a good price, so I took a chance"}
{"source": "  It's about one and a half inches wide, by the way"}
{"source": "  I'm very happy with it and I like that it has the flexibility to attach one end to either the headstock or a button"}
{"source": "  I can't think of any negatives, it's a nice, functional, non-flashy strap that does it's job well, and it's wide enough that it doesn't feel like it's digging into my shoulder"}
{"source": "Was a little hesitant to get a stomp pedal, especially a delay, for this price"}
{"source": " But I figured, how can you go wrong"}
{"source": "if it's not good, at least you're not out a lot of money"}
{"source": " I've been thoroughly impressed with this pedal"}
{"source": " Much more sturdy than it appears in photos"}
{"source": " I actually like that the input and output jacks are at the front of it"}
{"source": " Works great so far and don't regret purchasing"}
{"source": "worth every dime"}
{"source": "where else can you get a great-functioning delay pedal for this price?"}
{"source": "This delay is really nice, especially for the price"}
{"source": "  I am a fan of the FAB line of effects and have several of them"}
{"source": "  My favorite is this delay and the Echo"}
{"source": "  They have been very durable and I am confident that the plastic body of the pedals will remain durable"}
{"source": "  My only complaint is the markings on the level knobs"}
{"source": "  They have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see"}
{"source": "  This could have been more thoughtfully desingned with a thick bright white line that would contrast against the knob surface"}
{"source": "  This can be done yourself with a paint marker or whiteout brush, but it should have been considered ahead of time"}
{"source": "Bought this for a friend"}
{"source": " Cheap plastic enclosure"}
{"source": " Affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay"}
{"source": " He tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay"}
{"source": " Stay away from this one and get a better used pedal"}
{"source": "Like most of the other Danelectro pedals this one has a great sound and in this case a fairly inexpensive price though it is higher than most of their other pedals"}
{"source": "  Once again though get the AC-DC adapter for it as it'll put you in the poor house supplying 9v's to it"}
{"source": "it eats them like candy"}
{"source": "I love these cheap little pedals"}
{"source": "I don't know if these would make a long tour with rough use - but they will be good for small club use with a careful handler"}
{"source": "Great for around the house and rehearsal"}
{"source": "A little noisy - but what do you expect at this price, right?So far very reliable after a few months of use"}
{"source": " I will take this out on a little club tour and post back with problems and reliability concerns and if there are any preventative measures to address beforehand"}
{"source": "Otherwise - great product"}
{"source": " They look cool also - like something out of the 60's Star Trek or something"}
{"source": "*************************************09/27/2013I still use this pedal on my main pedal board - it just sounds so good!Sound guy asked me about it the other night - and when I showed it to him he didn't believe me"}
{"source": "$10 for some of the best analog delay sounds out there - who needs boutique pedals?"}
{"source": "I have two delay pedals, both inexpensive (this one and a Behringer) and although this one is even cheaper than the already cheap Behringer, the Danelectro sounds more natural"}
{"source": "  The Behringer has a somewhat brittle high end to the delayed signal, which is perfectly ok for some applications"}
{"source": "  The Danelectro has a warmer, almost analog feel"}
{"source": "  It sounds awesome when used in conjunction with your lead boost for solos"}
{"source": "  The case is plastic but unless you eat 3 times your weight at the Golden Corral buffet then jump up and down on the pedal with both feet, you're not going to break it"}
{"source": "  The only thing I don't like is that the three control knobs are facing away from you when you use it"}
{"source": "  I suppose this was done to allow the knobs to fit into the \"retro\" look of this pedal"}
{"source": "  Ok, fine"}
{"source": "  I've heard pedals costing twice as much that don't sound as nice as this one"}
{"source": "  As one reviewer once wrote, there are guitarists who would rather catch AIDS than be seen with cheap pedals on their pedal board; I, however, think some of these cheap pedals function quite well, and in some cases, just as well as their more expensive counterparts"}
{"source": "  If you have the nerve to put this pedal in the same board with your Holy Grail, OCD, and other \"boutique\" pedals, I promise the other ones won't catch AIDS from this"}
{"source": "  In fact, the whole ensemble will benefit"}
{"source": "I've owned two of these pedals and they both  had the same quirk"}
{"source": " The delay is amazing, the repeats trail and decay beautifully,The controls give you a wide range of tones"}
{"source": "But, They've both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me!  One constant high pitched screeching tone!My signal chain was low gain, And its done it when it was the only pedal In the chain, so It's not  another pedals Influence"}
{"source": " I love the sound, but, I won't use it live in case of feedback"}
{"source": "That being said its still a very good pedal"}
{"source": "People tell you you need to buy a 1000 dollar tube amp to sound good"}
{"source": "shuuut up"}
{"source": "mic this through a PA and you;re set never need another amp againUse amp modeling software that fender includes and you have a vast array of tones"}
{"source": "for 100 bucks"}
{"source": "Spend money on a top end guitar if you get this amp its all you need"}
{"source": "I haven't picked up a guitar in 15 years, but this was a LONG Winter and I needed something to occupy my time"}
{"source": "I broke out my Strat and discovered that the amp was dead - mice had eaten the wiring"}
{"source": "Crap"}
{"source": "So - Online to see what defined \"State of the Art\""}
{"source": "  This is It"}
{"source": "If you need a basic practice amp that, with a decent laptop and internet connection, can help you produce ANY sound with a few simple instructions THIS IS IT"}
{"source": "No Foot pedals or expensive add-ons [until you really have to have them]"}
{"source": " Just pure creative sound that won't break the bank"}
{"source": "Buy This Amp !"}
{"source": "The last amplifier I purchased was a Fender Twin valve some years ago"}
{"source": " It is difficult to use in a small apartment - too loud!! So, after giving up trying to use this with the volume at '1', I searched for a smaller thing"}
{"source": " This amp looked suspiciously cheap and, although the reviews were great, still was concerned whether it would be good enough"}
{"source": " It arrived and I got into realizing it went on the web for downloading presets and all kinds of features, including recording"}
{"source": " This was really a mind blowing thing"}
{"source": " The built in sounds and effects are better than many of my effect pedals, and I no longer use my Zoom"}
{"source": " Setting it emulate a twin reverb, with the effects used lightly, I am amazed at both the quality of this 'practise amp' and recommend this to anybody who wants a huge bang for their buck!!!"}
{"source": "This amp is a ton of fun"}
{"source": " The presets sound great by themselves, but you can also spend hours tweaking the sounds with the Fender Fuse software"}
{"source": " It is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike"}
{"source": "This is really a great amp for the price"}
{"source": "  If you're new to electric guitar, and you want an amp to get started, buy this one"}
{"source": "  It has incredible versatility, and you can get started with trying out a huge range of different sounds without having to invest in a variety of effects and different amps"}
{"source": "I got much more than I expected for the price of this amp"}
{"source": "  I really like the Bassman and Twin Reverb settings"}
{"source": "I won't claim that you can buy this amp and never have need for something bigger, better, vintage tube, etc"}
{"source": ", but this will more than meet your needs to use at home"}
{"source": "  Buy the 20W version, which is plenty loud for home"}
{"source": "  Later - when you have the skills to justify it, start buying some tube equipment"}
{"source": "  This amp will help you figure out what tones you like for the music you want to play"}
{"source": "I considered various new/used amps in the same price range, and I'm extremely happy I picked this one"}
{"source": "  If you came by my house with some other brand new amp that cost twice as much as this and wanted to trade me, I'd tell you to go away"}
{"source": "  But if you stop by with a nice Twin Reverb, I'd give up my Mustang "}
{"source": " but then I'd go buy another one"}
{"source": "I love small amps and have played many of them over the last 25 years"}
{"source": " I still own a few, my favorite being the first Super Champ from the early '80s; Rivera nailed that one"}
{"source": " I naturally prefer tubes for that true tone, but tried one of these out last year at a pal's place and was sold within two minutes"}
{"source": " I bought one six months ago and after playing it almost daily since then I can say without doubt that this is the most versatile solid state practice amp I've ever used"}
{"source": "For the money it's a crazy deal"}
{"source": " I have never once used the included online stuff or the Ableton software, so those add even more value to this package, no doubt"}
{"source": " All I wanted was a warm up amp with real tone, and this is that and plenty more"}
{"source": " My all-time favorite tone is the clean glassy Fender late-'50s/early '60s sound, typified by the Bassmans and Twins and Deluxes of the pre-CBS era"}
{"source": " That tone needs tubes to really sing, but to my amazement the amp modeling of this Mustang comes amazingly close to that sound without tubes"}
{"source": " You'll always miss that tube sag but the crispness and snap is all there, especially on the Bassman settings"}
{"source": " My Strats sound so damn good through this on clean settings, and my PRS absolutely smokes with real lease-breaking volume on Super-Sonic (dial the gain way back for a nice low-throttle roar)"}
{"source": "Having gain, volume and master lets you dial in a TON of tones with each amp model, and the two separate effects knobs let you add chorus/tremolo etc plus various reverbs/delays etc, though I find myself keeping everything totally clean as time goes by; if I can't get the tone I want with my fingers then I need to learn how to is my motto"}
{"source": " And this amp is so accurate that I can"}
{"source": "Above all, this Mustang is MUSICAL"}
{"source": " For a small amp that's a real feat, but for 100 clams it's a near miracle"}
{"source": " Add a built in tuner (the most useful \"extra\" ANY amp can have), good effects, great amp models, the software and more online amp models (which I'll get around to one day but so far I get all the tone I need from the amp as it is), plus 20 watts for lots of headroom, and this is a straight up steal for a bill"}
{"source": "The only thing missing is serious bass at volume, but this is an 8 after all, not a 10, so you'll always miss some of the real bottom"}
{"source": " But what's there is solid and tight and only craps out at top volume; only with a rock drummer will you need more roar than this provides"}
{"source": " You could easily do quiet jazz and folk gigs with this puppy"}
{"source": "All told, the Mustang I is easily not only the best value practice amp of them all out there now (Crate and Line 6 etc don't come close), but paired with a mini-Strat this would be the absolutely PERFECT beginner's set up for a kid looking to play anything from the Beatles to Metallica and everything in between"}
{"source": "Can't recommend this highly enough to anyone who thinks real tone can't come in a small solid state amp"}
{"source": " It can, it does, and it's cheaper than I can still believe"}
{"source": "Fender truly went to 11 on this one"}
{"source": "Leo would be proud!"}
{"source": "I bough this amp for my 9 year old son who is learning guitar for his Christmas present"}
{"source": "  I thought that since I love Fender guitars and since he has a mini Squier we'd like to get something in the Fender Family"}
{"source": "  I seriously expected a cheap imitation of a Line 6 Spider with a Fender logo slapped on it"}
{"source": "  I should have had more faith in Fender"}
{"source": "I am blown away by the sounds that come out of this amp"}
{"source": "  The AMP models are far more real and interesting sounding than any modeling tool I have ever used"}
{"source": "  The amps don't sound digital or processed, they actually sound overdriven when you crank the gain"}
{"source": "  You would swear that there are tubes in this thing when you listen to it"}
{"source": "  I can't get over the Bassman, the twin Reverb and the Deluxe"}
{"source": "  They sound so full and strong"}
{"source": "My biggest compliment of the Mustang is that it is the ONLY modeling amp that has great sounding Vintage tones"}
{"source": "  Line 6 has tons of metal stuff, and a lot of weird niche tones"}
{"source": "  Vox has never really made great modeling stuff"}
{"source": "  Digitech sounds super processed and the vintage tones are terrible"}
{"source": "If you play Blues, Rock, Classic Rock, Country, Funk etc"}
{"source": " This amp is for you"}
{"source": "  There is just enough metal or heavy sounds to have a few choices for Modern Metal, but Metalheads might be better off with the Line 6 stuff"}
{"source": "The other great thing about this amp is how easy it is to tweak the tones using the amp controls"}
{"source": "  By looking at the controls, you know right where you are and what you have to do to edit your sound"}
{"source": "  You don't need to dive 5 levels deep into an LCD screen in order to make great sounding tweaks"}
{"source": "But if you like to go deep, you'll love the Fender Fuse software"}
{"source": "  It is easy to use and there are countless user submitted tones to help shape your sound"}
{"source": "The fact that Fender not only included FUSE with this amp, but also the Ableton recording software that is also pretty user friendly and fully usable without having to pay to upgrade anything, is just frosting on the cake"}
{"source": "I am a father of 4 who normally has to practice at night and being able to have an amp that can get quiet but still sound amazing, with the added features of a headphone jack and an AUX in, I can play whenever I want"}
{"source": "  I am actually selling my nice Tube amp and using the Mustang as my only amp for now, and I feel like I am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at all"}
{"source": "The value of this amp is amazing"}
{"source": "  People will shell out 2-3x as much for a Line 6 modeler, but the vintage tones will not sound anywhere close to as good as the Fender tones"}
{"source": "This amp is awesome! Its great JUST like it's advertised"}
{"source": " I play more of the modern metal side but i managed to make quite a few sick distortions using the Fender Fuse software"}
{"source": " Fender Fuse is very simple to use and once you get the hang of it you can get more detailed & advanced with your settings to get the tone you desire"}
{"source": " The amp itself has 24 presets (as advertised) & are shown in 3 different colors (Red, Green, & Orange)  and you can totally customize the presets"}
{"source": " So if you want 24 different distortions go for it! Another thing it comes with ableton live but its just a demo version of the program so u can look at the tutorials & learn how to use it & record some music but you can't save them (bummer i know) BUT! it gives you some kinda pass that allows you to save a few recordings"}
{"source": " One last thing you can purchase a one button foot pedal (about $20)the Fender mustang 1&2 can only USE the 1 button foot pedal the foot pedals that uses 2 buttons or up can only be use by Fender Mustangs 3 & up REMEMBER THIS!"}
{"source": "I've just received my Mustang I and have spent an hour playing with it and the Fuse software"}
{"source": "  This thing is outrageous for a practice amp and I've never heard anything like it in its price class and size!  With a good instrument mic and a decent monitoring system, I think you could probably gig with this thing"}
{"source": "  One feature in the Fuse software that no one seems to mention is the ability to add an overdrive or compressor module \"post gain\" (after the preamp)"}
{"source": " This is an incredibly useful tool for controlling the overdrive characteristics of the amp models"}
{"source": "  In effect, Fender has given this amp the ability to emulate power section saturation as the overdrive module sounds very different and much mellower post gain than pre gain (before the preamp like a normal stomp box)"}
{"source": "I don't know of any other dedicated modelers that do this except maybe the Axe-FX - and that costs about 20 times more"}
{"source": "  Power section saturation is highly desirable and is the reason why we're seeing a lot of very low power tube amps like the Fender Champion 600 and Bugera V5 these days"}
{"source": " Their problem is that they're pretty much useless for clean sounds at louder volumes - they don't have enough power for that so they're really only good for overdriven sounds"}
{"source": "  Not so the Mustang I"}
{"source": "  I think Fender has hit the perfect combination of flexibility and and simplicity in one package"}
{"source": "  This thing sounds way bigger than it looks and way better than its price would suggest"}
{"source": " It has the classic Fender sound and feel of many different Fender amps without the weight, cost and tube replacement needs"}
{"source": "  What's not to like?"}
{"source": "For $99 you get the best good sized, heavy duty, high quality amp with tons of SOUND!-Construction: Solid, good material and parts, Fender used the good stuff"}
{"source": "-Sound: Nice clear & LOUD sound especially for an 8\" speaker and 20W amp"}
{"source": " You can definitely jam with a drummer no problem, or just shred it wearing headphones"}
{"source": "-Effects: There are 9 \"amp models\" (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " \"57 deluxe\", \"metal 2000\", etc"}
{"source": ") and with these 9 amp sounds to choose from, you can apply 24 effects on top of any of the 9 amp models"}
{"source": "The effects include chorus, deep chorus, flange, tremelo, vibration, phaser, step filter, delay (150ms, 300ms, 700ms), Reverb, large hall, small room, echo filter, octaver, etc"}
{"source": ")So what are the presets? Each of the 9 amp models has been pre-programmed with three different presets (meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds)"}
{"source": "When you select a preset, like the first metal 2000 for example, the minute you touch the \"gain\" knob, the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set"}
{"source": " Same with treble, bass, volume, and all other effects"}
{"source": " The moment you touch any dials or effects knobs, you have custom control to tweak each preset, just temporarily, or save it if you wish"}
{"source": "It's so great, because often I feel I would have made a present slightly more this or that, simply grab the gain or change the treble, or move from delay to reverb and make it your own! Very easy"}
{"source": "-Ease of use: Plug in your guitar, spin the dials to select the presets and to change the effects"}
{"source": " Plug in ipod or computer with 3"}
{"source": "5mm male cable"}
{"source": " It's that easy!-PC Software: I've heard their is trouble installing, mine said \"error\" and did not install on Windows 7"}
{"source": " I know there are ways to fix this, and I will do so when I have some time"}
{"source": " Comes with a USB cable (mini for the amp, regular plug for the computer)"}
{"source": " Works for mac or PC, get more presets, use effects pedels and recording instruments through the computer"}
{"source": " Play on guitar rig and amplitude"}
{"source": " Awesome"}
{"source": "-Size: Perfect"}
{"source": " Big enough to give it a serious look, and a quality feel"}
{"source": " Small enough to fit easily under a table, next to your desk, etc"}
{"source": " Looks like 18\"x18\" to me"}
{"source": " The front metal-looking grill is mesh, but quality and looks great"}
{"source": "-Tuner: Super simple"}
{"source": " Doesn't tell you which note is in tune, just tells you left, right, or green in center for \"in tune\""}
{"source": "All in all when compared to the Line 6 Spider, and many other fender amps, this one has the quality sound, the dozens of different effect combinations, input for a footswitch, aux for ipod, and USB for computer"}
{"source": " It has it all"}
{"source": " I jam through headphones for hours each day since I bought it"}
{"source": " The reverb and gain distortion are so clean, and the clean channels on some of the amp models have really good tone"}
{"source": " My guitars sound way better than they used to through my old mini fender amp"}
{"source": "Don't sleep on this, it's $99 for a loud quality amp with $1,000s worth of effects peddles built in"}
{"source": "And did I mention, EASILY CUSTOMIZABLE so easy I could teach a 5 year old"}
{"source": " Select a preset, change the dials you want to change, make changes permanent only by hitting \"save\" otherwise presets stay the way the factory made them"}
{"source": "LOVE THIS AMP, and I've shopped EVERY comparable model"}
{"source": " This is the one, hands down worth a minimum of $150"}
{"source": "Louder than my friends 60W!:D ONE LOVE FENDER MUSTANG YOU ROCK!"}
{"source": "Well over the past 4 years I've been running through a bunch of these mini, micro, battery powered, small tubed, and solid state, model budget amplifiers"}
{"source": "Lets see, done all the Blackheart small amps, the Vox mini-3 & AC4TV, Roland MICRO-CUBE, plus a few other small amps"}
{"source": " I just sold my Fender Super Champ XD and wasn't going to get another amp because playing in my apartment with neighbors, I just cannot jam the way I'd like to"}
{"source": "I really liked all the above named amps but they really didn't give me the options of cranking it without disturbing my neighbors"}
{"source": " Loved the Fender Super Champ probably the best, but there wasn't a headphone jack"}
{"source": " Same with the Blackhearts and the Vox AC4TV and the potential of these amps just couldn't be used by me"}
{"source": " So I settled on the Vox Mini-3 (4watt), because it has a headphone jack, is also A/C or battery powered, among a lot of other great features and sounds"}
{"source": " but I did have to give up tube amp option"}
{"source": "So as I said I sold my Super Champ like a week ago and as I was mailing it out using the Amazon online mailing appz when I saw a picture and price (in the browser) on this new Fender Mustang I and I figured"}
{"source": " what the hell"}
{"source": " Lets see what its got to offer for under $100"}
{"source": " I mean everyone was giving it a 5-star rating, so whats a $100 bucks, even though I've never had a good sounding solid state amp"}
{"source": "Well I must say this thing rocks! There are like 3 phases of model amps, most I didn't like at first but was able to fine tune most of em to sound pretty great"}
{"source": " I mean its only a $100 amp so it cannot be compared to the real deals, but it does stand up pretty nice"}
{"source": " Plus it has the headphone jack (and a couple other plugins and effects) and this thing will blow your ears out"}
{"source": " Most amplifier headphone jacks"}
{"source": " tap out and never got loud enough for me, but this thing screams and blow-out your ears"}
{"source": " I've had it now like 3 days and was thinking about sending it back, but for $100, there's nothing in the market that can compare or compete with its, SOUND, low pricing, and options"}
{"source": " So I'm now glad that I sold my Fender Super Champ XD and bought this one and put the other $150 back in my pocket"}
{"source": " ya!This is the best solid state amp I've ever owned and I still miss the tube option"}
{"source": " But I'm sure something better will appear next year and until, then"}
{"source": " well a person just cannot go wrong by buying this Fender AMP!"}
{"source": "I got this on sale from GC for $80 shipped (plus $7 tax arrrgh)"}
{"source": " First and foremost this amp is AMAZING"}
{"source": "  All the hype and positive reviews you read are all true"}
{"source": "  My playing style varies from horrible attemps at sounding like a real player to half way decent renditions of actual songs (lol) and this amp does it all"}
{"source": "  The tube amp models sound like real tubes and have a tone and sound that just can't be described, they have to be heard"}
{"source": "  The modulations, and del/reverbs are well done also"}
{"source": "  There are a few of the effects that sound a little vanilla or digital but those can be tweaked with the Fuse software (or taken out completely)"}
{"source": "  All the controls are pretty easy to understand and adjust, and it does not take a brilliant mind to figure out how to make the amp sound good (even with my substandard playing ability!  Both of my cheap guitars sound great thru this amp"}
{"source": "  The tuner is pretty accurate and easy to use"}
{"source": "  Headphones work well also"}
{"source": "  About my only real complaints are so minor- no place to store the Power cord or USB cord (included!)"}
{"source": "  Printed documentation is pretty lame but the included DVD is more through"}
{"source": "  The Fuse software has to be downloaded and as I have limited online speed this took over an hour"}
{"source": "  The headphone jack is a 3"}
{"source": "5mm and most good headphones are still using the 1/4\""}
{"source": "  Not a big deal but the 3"}
{"source": "5mm to 1/4\" adaptors are somewhat weak and can be very touchy"}
{"source": "  The amp gives an audiable POP when powered down"}
{"source": "  No corner protectors on this"}
{"source": "  All in all if you are looking for a great small amp this will give you $1000's of dollars worth of effects and amp models all for under 100 clams!"}
{"source": "Originally put-off by the low price, I went with the reviews"}
{"source": "  Simply AWESOME!  This amp is packed with features"}
{"source": "  Beginner/Intermediate level player would be very pleased!  The best part is, it's not at all complex to learn the features"}
{"source": "Great little amp to mess around with"}
{"source": " The various sound changes and the range of sound mimics is amazing"}
{"source": " The software that came with it is a little limited for true professionals but has more than you need for home use"}
{"source": " Don't be fooled by the small size, this baby pumps out the noise quite well"}
{"source": " I'd rarely turn my master volume above level 4 (of 10) for home use and at small local taverns I'd set it at around level 8"}
{"source": " For a regular venue I have an extra Marshall 500-watt speaker system"}
{"source": "You will need time to read the manual and learn the settings making it fun to see what kind of effects you can get"}
{"source": " No pedals needed with this thing"}
{"source": " I only gave it 4-stars because I later bought the Mustang III which has a bunch more features for an extra $200 and a blow-out 100-watt speaker"}
{"source": " (The Mustang IV is the same as the III but with 150-watts"}
{"source": " Again, you can but an extra 100-watt speaker for $40, making the extra $200 for a Mustang IV a waste"}
{"source": ") The Mustang II is the same as this one but with a 40-watt speaker and $100 more"}
{"source": "If you need something to play with at home and want to try different effects and sounds this is a good one at a cheap price"}
{"source": " If you want the extra 20-watts (of the Mustang II) just buy this one and an extra 20-watt speaker (around $30) and jury rig it"}
{"source": " Otherwise I recommend plunking the extra $200 and get the Mustang III with a digital display readout and more effects"}
{"source": "I got one of these here on Amazon as a replacement for my other small practice amp, an older Fender 25 watt blackface two-channel that didn't have integrated EFX (that one has been more or less permanantly allocated to my church)"}
{"source": "Great little amp"}
{"source": " Only had it for a couple days, but the sounds you can evoke out of this thing are amazing"}
{"source": " Clean tones are pristine"}
{"source": " Distortion tones, a bit on the transistory side, but again, I haven't played with the setting enough (or even tried all the emulations)"}
{"source": " Controls are straightforward and easy to operate without glasses on"}
{"source": " It is a bit lacking in low-end, to be expected from a small 8\" speaker"}
{"source": " But that is okay for practice and rehearsal"}
{"source": " It is loud enough for rehearsal with a drummer (depending on the style of music)"}
{"source": " I did purchase the single button footswitch as well and it works great at switching between any TWO settings you define"}
{"source": "Have not had a chance to mess with the included software, but intend to do that when I have time"}
{"source": " I like the fact that I can tweak the amp to my EXACT preferences and it stays in memory; I only really have to do it once"}
{"source": " Great feature"}
{"source": "Only suggestions to Fender would be to add a recessed area in the back to stow the power cord (standard computer type) and optionally, the included USB cable"}
{"source": "Overall, for the price, it is an incredible value"}
{"source": " Great alternative to lugging my full rig (Marshall 2X12 cab, racked Rocktron Pirhanna, ADA 100 watt tube head, Alesis Midiverb IV and some other stuff)"}
{"source": " Get yours while you can at this price"}
{"source": "UPDATE -- The Fender software that you can download and use with this amp is freaking amazing"}
{"source": " I now have it more or less permanently attached to my computer via USB and am constantly tweaking and refining my tones"}
{"source": " The Princeton amp emulation is SWEET"}
{"source": " I am going to buy a second one, probably the larger Mustang III, cause I want the larger Celestion speaker"}
{"source": " You know, pretty much every Fender product I have ever purchased has been first rate, and this amp is no exception"}
{"source": " And I don't care if it is made in Mexico (my guitar is a differnt matter though"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "im not a profesional player but i like to play once in a while just for fun and this sound great"}
{"source": "My review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more"}
{"source": " When I first got it I liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first I thought it was great"}
{"source": " Then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away"}
{"source": "After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things"}
{"source": " Go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google"}
{"source": "The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things"}
{"source": " Fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and I don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body, unless I have a grand to pay for an older one, I'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first"}
{"source": "so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality"}
{"source": " Also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people I've read the complaints I was trying not to realize, as I didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, BUT I DID!And I am so glad I did"}
{"source": " I almost got a peavey vypyr, and I am glad I didn't"}
{"source": " This amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which I read on fender's own forum/website, FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS, BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS!! sorry, but that's some big company b"}
{"source": "s"}
{"source": "I've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and I was like \"what music snobs\" and what have you"}
{"source": " But I realized that I'm a music snob! I love the music I listen to more than anything, and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well"}
{"source": " So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt, cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn't have that crackle sound, but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return, as after that, it would have been final"}
{"source": "The decision I did make I think will be great for me, as I'd rather start with a good real tone, then get the effects I need"}
{"source": " I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying \"throw away your pedals, you won't need them\" and \"I was going to get pedals, but don't need to now\", that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume"}
{"source": "I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp"}
{"source": "I think if I played this at a GC I wouldn't of gotten it, and I just tried to make myself like it"}
{"source": "As far as amps that model vintage tones"}
{"source": "  This is the best"}
{"source": "For my ear, Line 6, Vox, Crate, Digitech etc are nowhere near the Fender Mustang if you are comparing Vintage tones"}
{"source": "I have played amps and effects from many companies, as well as many of the 'hybrid amps' that combine tube and digital tones, and if you are looking for the best recreation of Vintage Blues, Rock, Hard Rock, Country tones"}
{"source": " the type of tones that you get from some of the famed Fender amps, the Mustang Series is as good as you are going to do"}
{"source": "I originally bought the Mustang I for my 9 year old son to be his first practice amp and when we hooked it up for him, I could hardly let him play"}
{"source": "The tone editing is easy through the controls on the amp"}
{"source": "  It is easy and straight forward to see what you need to do to tweak your sound just by turning knobs"}
{"source": "  When you add the Fender FUSE to the mix and start to download new tones from the web and tweak it with dozens of stomp boxes and effects that are free to play with and try and keep on your amp this is an amazing value"}
{"source": " (not to even mention the Ableton recording software that comes for free with the amp"}
{"source": ")The reason I love this amp is because of the faithful recreation of the great Fender amps like the Bassman, Deluxe Reverb, and Twin Reverb"}
{"source": "  I have never heard a digital sound replicate tube amps even close to this well"}
{"source": "I have heard several people say that they would never buy this amp because it is not a tube amp or because they are not computer savvy"}
{"source": "For the Tube amp snobs"}
{"source": "Nothing is going to match the sound of a really great Fender Tube amp"}
{"source": "  But if you want to recreate great fender amps at low volumes the Mustang will be a great practice amp for you"}
{"source": " OR"}
{"source": " if you want to bring an amp to practice that weighs a fraction of what your Fender Tube amps weighs, the mustang is a great choice"}
{"source": "  I am selling my only tube amp now that I have the Mustang II because I don't gig and really need an amp that I can practice with at night while the kids are in bed"}
{"source": "For the Non-Computer folk"}
{"source": "There is plenty to keep you occupied on this amp without ever plugging it into a computer"}
{"source": "  And if you want to give it a try, it couldn't be easier to download new sounds and tweak your favorite tones"}
{"source": "For the Metalheads"}
{"source": "This amp probably is not for you"}
{"source": "  Go try and buy a higher gain Line 6 or the Vox ADT series of hybrid amps to get some really heavy tones"}
{"source": "  There are some decent metal tones to download on the FUSE, but the real strength of this amp is Vintage tones"}
{"source": "Let me make it clear!  I played my son's Squier Mini guitar through this amp and it sounds really amazing"}
{"source": "  I have a Fender Strat, Squier Tele and a Les Paul and they all sound amazing in this amp"}
{"source": "This is the first piece of guitar equipment that has given me absolutely NO buyers remorse"}
{"source": "  Unbeatable value"}
{"source": "  A great toy"}
{"source": "  A perfect practice tool"}
{"source": "  You can't beat it"}
{"source": "Well, just got it, plugged in and here are some initial impressions"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " Pretty much what I expected - much more \"relaxed\" at higher volumes than the M1"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " Definitely much bigger and fuller sounding with its commensurate drawbacks"}
{"source": "- slightly less naturally sparkly compared to the M1- will have to reduce the mids a bit via the Fuse editor"}
{"source": "- although it has less overall sparkle, that also translates to smoother highs"}
{"source": " I was actually a bit hard pressed to get it to sound buzzy"}
{"source": " This is of course via the front panel only"}
{"source": " I'm sure it can be done using the Fuse editor"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " It's supposed to be 7 lbs"}
{"source": " heavier than the M1 but it sure doesn't feel like it"}
{"source": " I keep looking at the M1 fiendishly wondering if there's a way to shoehorn a 12\" speaker in there"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " For the most part, the patches created in the M1 translated pretty well after the required firmware update, needing just a few adjustments here and there"}
{"source": "5"}
{"source": " I'm appreciative of the fuller more naturally extended low end as I won't have to crank the bass control as much as I have to on the M1"}
{"source": " That of course translates to more headroom for the power amp"}
{"source": "More from editing via Fuse - here are a few of the things that I found and liked"}
{"source": "- The 65 Deluxe model sounds better with the 57 Deluxe's Cab and vice versa"}
{"source": " The 65 has more headroom and works great as a clean spanky amp with the 57's cab while the 57 model's propensity to break up sooner works better with the 65's less sparkly cab"}
{"source": " The 57 also seems to have more low end girth"}
{"source": "- The Twin is a bit too icepick-y sometimes and it seems to pair better with the Bassman's cab"}
{"source": "- The SuperSonic's Cab is a bit more muted at the top end than any of the other cabs and works well for sounds I use that have a bit more gain"}
{"source": " It's good for keeping things from getting too buzzy"}
{"source": " It's a very fat sounding Cab sim"}
{"source": "- Both the M1 and 2 seem to respond really well with my Tex-Mex pickups"}
{"source": " I have not played a guitar with regular sized humbuckers on these amps yet (my other guitar has mini humbuckers) but somehow I get the feeling that I won't like it as much as I do with the strat"}
{"source": " I think this is understandable though"}
{"source": " Since Fender has always been all about the single coils, I'm not surprised that the impedance relationship between these amps and my strat feels so spot on"}
{"source": "So far, for 200 bucks"}
{"source": " I couldn't ask for more"}
{"source": "I passed on all the Fender G-Dec units for years,(still glad I did), instead buying the Line 6 Spyder Jam and then a Line 6 Spyder IV"}
{"source": " They are both great amps for sure, but for the money, Fender has really got this one right"}
{"source": "  The clean tones on this are just great"}
{"source": " The ability to modify with FUSE is an additional layer of gravy"}
{"source": "  The amp is just about perfect for bedroom, studio or practice"}
{"source": " I bet more than a few of these quietly show up in Nashville studios"}
{"source": "I still love my Line 6 units, especially my Spyder Jam cause I can play along with tracks, and I love the accuracy of the models in the Line 6 Spyder IV"}
{"source": "  But if you are in the market for a great practice amp, or an amp that will take you from super clean to vintage dirty for special effects on a demo, Fender hits the mark on this one"}
{"source": " It's just ridiculous what is in this for $199"}
{"source": "I compared this to a VOX Valve modeling amp, not even a contest"}
{"source": " Against a Spyder IV, individual tastes will vary"}
{"source": "Only complaint is the \"stacking\" of the six effects onto just two knobs"}
{"source": " But that is a minor complaint"}
{"source": " Most people don't use chorus and flange at the same time anyway"}
{"source": "If you are in the market for a cheap, reliable modeling amp that is less cost than a Digitec RP500 pedal, you owe yourself to look at this thing"}
{"source": " Right now, it is the biggest bang for the buck"}
{"source": " I only wish I had bought the Mustang III, but it was not available yet when I purchased"}
{"source": "This is my 3rd VOX Amplug I have purchased through Amazon"}
{"source": "  They are all awesome in thier own way"}
{"source": "  The Satriani Amplug has very nice effects similar to a flanger and delay with reverb"}
{"source": "  Without the effects on it is similar to the Lead plug with much lighter distortion - still has nice crunch to it though"}
{"source": "  If you are a Satch fan you will find this amplug endlessly entertaining!  If you could only buy just one, this one may not be for you depending on what style music you like to play"}
{"source": "  I love metal, rock, classic rock etc"}
{"source": "The first song I played through this plug was 'The Star Spangled Banner' (ala Jimmi Hendrix) and wow, the Satch effects just make it sound amazing!  The Top Gun anthem sounds wicked with this plug as well"}
{"source": "If you are looking for a pure distorted metal sound go for the Metal Amplug - it rocks your face off(I LOVE MINE)"}
{"source": " The AC30 Amplug is real nice for classic rock and country (it is nice and clean but can go into AC/DC tones) - very versatile Amplug"}
{"source": "The Satch Amplug is a welcome addition to my collection"}
{"source": "I would tell you to buy it, and if I lost mine I would replace it immediately"}
{"source": "  Same with the Metal Amplug"}
{"source": "  If I lost my AC30 Amplug I would wait for it to go on sale or something and pick up another -  as versatile as it is, I don't play enough classic rock or country as I do metal"}
{"source": "For those unfamiliar with Vox's amPlug products, these things are amazing"}
{"source": "  I'm just old enough to remember some of the portable options of the 1990's, and they were mostly terrible"}
{"source": "  What Vox has done with these tiny headphone amplifiers (which weigh virtually nothing, run for 10-15 hours on 2 AAA batteries, and plug directly into the guitar) is nothing short of amazing"}
{"source": "  They have incredible amp-like tone and get as loud as you can possibly want"}
{"source": "  Even through a pair of $20 Sony headphones, they sound amazing"}
{"source": "  The star of the collection, in my opinion, is the Vox AC30 amPlug, which does a great vintage tube amp ranging from sparkling cleans to Top Boost overdrive"}
{"source": "  If you haven't played an amPlug before, the AC30 one is $39"}
{"source": "99 of the best money you'll ever spend"}
{"source": "Now, getting to this specific Joe Satriani amPlug, it's impossible to talk about the tone without talking about the guitarist himself"}
{"source": "  Fans of Joe Satriani (even casual ones) will recognize elements of this sound right away"}
{"source": "  Satriani has a very distinctive sound, which he crafted over the years using a modified Boss DS-1 Distortion and (more recently) his Vox \"Satchurator\" Distortion Box"}
{"source": "  It's a thick lead tone with a nice sustain, and colored with a delay effect"}
{"source": "  Both of those elements are present on this signature amPlug"}
{"source": "  You have a level control, a gain control, and a tone control"}
{"source": "  There's also three switch positions: Off, On, and Fx"}
{"source": "  The \"Fx\" position engages the delay effect, but the tone is otherwise the same"}
{"source": "PROS:First, the price retails at $49"}
{"source": "99, whereas most of the other models are $39"}
{"source": "99"}
{"source": "  (I believe the Lead amPlug is also $49"}
{"source": "99 and also has a delay feature)"}
{"source": "  I think that the added delay feature and unique tone are worth the extra money, but this is admittedly a sort of \"niche\" product"}
{"source": "  Overall, however, you have several amPlugs to choose from, and if you choose this one, $49"}
{"source": "99 is still an incredible value for the ability to play your guitar virtually anywhere and enjoy quality tone"}
{"source": "  The tone has a real sweet spot between \"3\" and \"5\" that really makes it enjoyable to play lead notes"}
{"source": "  While it isn't necessarily and \"ideal\" rhythm guitar distortion, you can hit rich chords with nice sustain"}
{"source": "  I prefer the tone on the higher gain levels, and you can really crank it up if you want to, but it sounds great at lower volumes too"}
{"source": "  The delay is also surprisingly good - it's probably set to around the 400 milisecond gap, which is pretty standard"}
{"source": "  Adds a cool echo \"fullness\" to your solo progressions, much like a classic Satriani solo"}
{"source": "  Again, the overall tone is fantastic"}
{"source": "  With the amount of gain provided, you can play most types of rock and dabble into metal guitar a bit (though I've always thought of Satch of more a technical, melodic guitarist than a \"metal\" guitarist)"}
{"source": "CONS:There are a few things to know about the Satriani signature model, but I don't think any of them should discourage you from checking it out"}
{"source": "  While the delay is surprisingly good, you can't customize it"}
{"source": "  You can't make the repeats shorter or longer, and you can't adjust the timing of the repeats"}
{"source": "  Keep in mind that this is mostly a \"practice\" device for your personal use, however, and I still enjoy using the delay"}
{"source": "  As for the tone, which I mostly discussed as a \"pro\" in the paragraph above, you should be aware that this is not meant to be a \"clean\" signal"}
{"source": "  It is possible to get a somewhat clean tone by rolling back on the gain or lowering the volume of your guitar, but it's mostly distortion or bust"}
{"source": "  The durability of all of the amPlugs has also been questioned by some"}
{"source": "  The device is VERY lightweight and all plastic, except for the metal plug portion"}
{"source": "  I don't doubt that you could bang it on something and break it quite easily"}
{"source": "  The switches and dials may also fail over time"}
{"source": "  But frankly, at $40 or $50, it's probably a better value than making it out of heavy duty metal and charging $100 for it, which would lock more people out of the market"}
{"source": "  I would certainly buy another one (or several) if any of mine broke"}
{"source": "  Finally, there as an audible \"hiss\" noise through your headphones anytime the device is on"}
{"source": "  Slightly annoying when you're not playing, but I don't notice it at all once I start playing notes"}
{"source": "THE VERDICT:One other \"dirty little secret\" to point out about these things: in addition to the Aux jack, which allows you to plug in an MP3 player and jam along, it is possible to use a 1/8\" to 1/4\" adapter and audio cable to plug this thing directly into an amp, PA, or anything with speakers"}
{"source": "  You might be surprised how good it sounds"}
{"source": "As an after-note, I wrote most of this review playing on my Jackson DR6, which has two Seymour Duncan Humbuckers, and it sounded great"}
{"source": "  I later tried it on a Gibson Les Paul (which is usually my primary guitar), and despite the fact it also has two humbuckers, it did not sound as good"}
{"source": "  The distortion was much more \"fizzy\""}
{"source": "  Haven't tried it with single coil pickups, but I think that it would likely work well with a Strat-type guitar due to the overall \"roundness\" of the tone"}
{"source": "The amPlug is a great invention that allows so many players to log endless hours practicing, irrespective of their budget or living situation"}
{"source": "  The Satriani model brings its own special character to the series, and if you like the tone as much as I do, might become an instant favorite"}
{"source": "I thought that this may be just a joke but it turns out that it's a nice little portable amp"}
{"source": "Of course you can't drive it very hard or the distortion gets to be too much, but if you keepit low it works very nicely and the price makes it very attractive"}
{"source": "I use the amp in my shop when testing out new guitar configurations (Pickups) on the flyand then if it sounds OK go to the big boys in my blues room"}
{"source": "The amp will reach its max in short order, but again, for what it is and the price, it ishard to find an equal"}
{"source": "A nice little amp to rock out with"}
{"source": " So it may not be what professionals use or anything like that but it gets the job done which is all I asked"}
{"source": "I have a fully-weighted 88-key Alesis QS 8"}
{"source": "1 and an M-Audio Axiom 61 semi-weighted and they're both fine when I'm just playing standalone or recording audio or MIDI"}
{"source": " But I wanted something with a lighter touch for entering notation and experimenting with soft synth sounds, when my focus is more on writing and software than on playing, per se"}
{"source": " The Alesis is perfect: I can grab keys effortlessly without feeling distracted by playing the keyboard 'correctly' - if that makes sense (it makes a clear difference to me)"}
{"source": "I opted for the 25 key strictly for space considerations and, while the down/up octave shift keys are easy and intuitive to use, I often wish I'd gone for a larger model to get wider voicings"}
{"source": " I may trade it in for an upgrade at some point, but overall I'm very happy with the keyboard"}
{"source": "Could be a fluke, but my unit was defective straight out of the box"}
{"source": "  Plugged it into the Macbook Pro, fired up GarageBand and right away it's MIDI connectivity was intermittent"}
{"source": " Then it had some stuck notes"}
{"source": "  Then it stopped being recognized at all"}
{"source": "  It still got power from the USB bus, but no MIDI, no sound"}
{"source": "  The jack was visibly wiggly, too"}
{"source": "So, you're mileage may vary, but mine obviously had a defective USB port on the back"}
{"source": "  Rather than bust it open and get soldering iron, I returned it and bought an M-Audio Oxygen 25 for $20 more"}
{"source": "With drum pads, I basically either get 0 velocity, or max"}
{"source": "  And I have to really hammer on them to trigger"}
{"source": "  Hurts after a while"}
{"source": "Likes:+ Size+ Assignable knobs"}
{"source": "+ Works good w/ Ableton LiveDislikes:- Drum pads!Keys are pretty cheesy but workable and expected for this price and size"}
{"source": "I'm looking to upgrade after a month"}
{"source": " Want better drum pads"}
{"source": "  :-/"}
{"source": "This unit might be great if you have child hands - The KEYS ON THE  keyboard is soooo small"}
{"source": "  Don't get this if you have Man hands! wtf U[DATE THE DESCRIPTION Akai WTF"}
{"source": "This tuner looks nice, and works great"}
{"source": " It puts guitars into the best tune"}
{"source": " It has lasted for over a year and the battery hasn't died yet"}
{"source": " Some might say it breaks easily but as long as it is dealt with gently there will be no problems"}
{"source": " Great price, great tuner, worth the buy"}
{"source": "This tuner is great and well worth the $15 you will pay for it at most places but I've seen it as high as $30-35 and that is just a rip off"}
{"source": "For this price, you owe it to yourself to get at least one of these little things, better yet, get one for each guitar you own"}
{"source": "They're reliable and easy to use"}
{"source": " And ACCURATE!!!You can mount these in such a way that the display points to be back of the headstock"}
{"source": " That way, they're easy to read and don't screw up the look of your guitar"}
{"source": "Why no 5 star review? Because they're battery eaters"}
{"source": " The provided battery lasts for about a month, then starts dimming"}
{"source": " Not cool"}
{"source": " A rechargeable version would be good"}
{"source": "Other pedals in this category can be anywhere from 50-150 and more"}
{"source": "  I just wanted a decent simple pedal that could be used on occasion with my garage band buddies"}
{"source": "  This is perfect"}
{"source": "  I've only used a few times so I can't testify to the durabilty, but it sounds great"}
{"source": "  Does exactly what you want out of an analog delay pedal"}
{"source": "First, let me tell you what this pedal can't do"}
{"source": "  It won't do long delays"}
{"source": "  So, if you're into the sound of The Edge from U2 or David Gilmour, look for something else"}
{"source": "  Expect to shell out over a hundred dollars for a delay pedal with lots of knobs and switches that are more versatile"}
{"source": "  But if you just need a slapback delay or just a touch of ambience, this pedal will not disappoint!  Analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic"}
{"source": "  Users of MXR Carbon Copy swear by them"}
{"source": "  But for around $30, the Rogue pedal will get you close, minus the longer delay time"}
{"source": "  I've read in some guitar forums that these are the same as the Belcat and Modtone boxes"}
{"source": "  The pedal itself looks sturdy, made out of metal"}
{"source": "  Compared to my digital delay, the Rogue sounded warmer, although my other delay has a switch for \"echo\" that made it warmer too"}
{"source": "  This pedal sounded good and I have no complaints"}
{"source": "  I don't use a long delay time, in fact, I don't max it out"}
{"source": "  I only use about 75-80 percent"}
{"source": "  Before judging this pedal, please experiment on it's placement on your pedal board"}
{"source": "  The user manual advises you to put it before the distortion but unfortunately, it doesn't sound good on my rig"}
{"source": "  Placing after the distortion pedal sounded better"}
{"source": "  However, everytime I use the dirt channel of my Traynor YCV40, the tone gets muddy"}
{"source": "  Now it's in the effects loop just like my other delay"}
{"source": "  The sound has better definition"}
{"source": "  It might sound different on your amp but at least try placing it before the distortion, then after the distortion and finally, the effects loop in your amp"}
{"source": "  Ultimately, you and your gear will have the last say"}
{"source": "  Overall, a good deal for the price"}
{"source": "  I'm thinking of setting up a smaller board of 4 inexpensive pedals for that grab and go situation where my big board will be too cumbersome"}
{"source": "  And if anything goes wrong, I can easily replace the pedals (Joyo, Rogue, Mooer)"}
{"source": "  Play on!"}
{"source": "I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the guitar when I was thinking about buying it, but I read all the review on it and decided to give a shot"}
{"source": "  I figured for the price ($39"}
{"source": "99 in late Nov 2012) that it wouldn't be a big deal if it was a crap guitar because I bought it to play around with while I visit my family in CA"}
{"source": "  When I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised!The guitar came in great shape"}
{"source": "  It was packed well and didn't have any damage on it"}
{"source": "  The top fret on the fretboard has some extra glue on it, but it doesn't affect the performance of the guitar"}
{"source": "  It came with an allen wrench to adjust the trust rod and once I lowered the action on the guitar, it was much easier to play"}
{"source": "The sound is excellent even with the strings they provide which seem like medium weight"}
{"source": "  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase"}
{"source": "  It sounds as good or better as my old school ovation that cost three times as much"}
{"source": "  The pick guard looks a bit cheap, but that's just nitpicking"}
{"source": "If you want a cheap guitar that sounds great, I totally recommend this one"}
{"source": "  I am extremely happy with this purchase"}
{"source": "I have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100"}
{"source": " I have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and I also have some cheapies"}
{"source": " Some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the \"Cheapies\" I've been dealing with Musician's friend forever"}
{"source": " Rogue is Musician's Friend's brand"}
{"source": " Music 123 is a Musician's Friend affiliate and they also sell Rogue guitars"}
{"source": " I have several different models of Rogue guitars and I'm impressed with all of them"}
{"source": " The Rogue RA-090 is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the Fender Starcaster"}
{"source": " Here's the good part, the Rogue is about half the price of the Fender! Many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one"}
{"source": " Once they realize it's not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers,they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten"}
{"source": " If you're not sure if you're serious about learning to play, this is the guitar for you"}
{"source": " Even if you're an intermediate to advanced player, you still can't go wrong with this guitar"}
{"source": " It has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument"}
{"source": " The finish and workmanship is also like what you'd find on a more expensive guitar"}
{"source": " They look, play and sound great! Many people tend to shy away from Rogue guitars because of the low price"}
{"source": " They figure a guitar that cheap can't be much good"}
{"source": " That's where they're wrong! You have to actually play one to understand what I'm talking about"}
{"source": " Once you play a Rogue guitar, you too, will become a believer"}
{"source": " This is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire"}
{"source": " If it happens to get damaged or stolen you're not out an arm and a leg"}
{"source": " I love Fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites, but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar, the Rogue is a much better value than the Fender and equal if not better in quality"}
{"source": " The Rogue RA-090 comes in a variety of color choices"}
{"source": " If or when you decide to sell it, you can usually get back what you paid for it"}
{"source": "I give Rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one"}
{"source": " I've been playing guitar for 51 years so I should know what I'm talking about"}
{"source": " I do not own stock in Musician's Friend, Music 123, or Rogue guitars and I don't get paid to endorse them"}
{"source": " This review is my honest opinion"}
{"source": "I'm really happy with this pedal"}
{"source": "  Give a good phase sounds like Waylon would use"}
{"source": "  Simple to use, one knob and it doesn't boost or reduce the signal"}
{"source": "I bought this as i had already purchased tow other Joyo pedals just to see what the buzz was about"}
{"source": "This phaser is perfect"}
{"source": "  I do not use a dramatic effect, more or an EVH setting for leads"}
{"source": "  This pedal is 99"}
{"source": "8% sounding like the MXR"}
{"source": "  I never give anything a 100%"}
{"source": "  This is a a great phase pedal, great tone and a great price"}
{"source": "  I am done thinking a good pedal must cost $200 and above"}
{"source": "  This was like $35 and sounds awesome!"}
{"source": "This is as much a reply to the guy who wants to hear from people who have had this for more than a week as it is a review for prospective buyers"}
{"source": " I've used it for 8 months with no issues at all"}
{"source": " It sounds great, it works perfectly and it was $40"}
{"source": " As for quality control, I have several Joyo pedals, and I can say they all work perfectly and sound awesome"}
{"source": " I've never used a Phase 90, so the \"clone\" factor was a moot point when I purchased the Joyo Vintage Phaser"}
{"source": " It works, it's simple to use and I had money left over to buy more gear"}
{"source": " I've been playing for 29 years and I highly recommend Joyo pedals"}
{"source": " If you don't like it, get a refund"}
{"source": " It's not rocket surgery"}
{"source": "A dull, inept version of a TubeScreamer"}
{"source": " Just sounds flat and boring"}
{"source": " Not very inspiring"}
{"source": " At all"}
{"source": " (Then again, I never did really like TS's)"}
{"source": "This is a lot of overdrive goodness for not a lot of money"}
{"source": "  Mine has the older paintjob with the monkey on it, which makes it sound infinitely better IMHO lol"}
{"source": "  This is intended to be used with a tube amp to achieve breakup and it does that job very nicely"}
{"source": " Those seeking brutalzz should look elsewhere"}
{"source": "  You can't blame a chicken for not quacking properly"}
{"source": "  It plays nicely with other pedals and can be used to boost another dirtbox for when you've reached the part of Freebird that we've all been waiting for"}
{"source": " The build quality is decent for the price and it claims true bypass thought I haven't looked under the hood"}
{"source": "  Regardless of whether it's 'TRUE' or 'buffered', it doesn't color my sound when it's off"}
{"source": "  Truth be told, I kind of prefer my Behringer TO800 tonewise- more of a personal preferance in the way I prefer Pepsi to Coke but still drink both - but the TO800 pedal isn't true bypass and the build is much more flimsy on that one"}
{"source": " I think that if you are addicted to OD/FUZZ boxes like I am you should grab one of these for your toolbox"}
{"source": "  If you aren't a hoarder of dirtboxes but you are just looking for a very nice tubescreamer on the cheap you can't go wrong with this one"}
{"source": "  You can handpaint the cover with an owl or whatnot and tell your cork-sniffer bandmates that you spent an arm and a leg on it"}
{"source": "  They will be none the wiser"}
{"source": "  I think enough of this pedal/company that I just ordered the JF-02 OCD clone and will probably grab the Octive Fuzz when my wife isn't looking - though if one more pedal comes into the house this month I may be strangled in my sleep !"}
{"source": "I honestly was not impressed"}
{"source": " It looked Cheap, sounded cheap, what else is there to say, you get what you pay for!!! Another Chinese copy of a tubescreamer,"}
{"source": "I don't know if it lives up to all the hype and mystical powers of the all-mighty vintage tube screamers of Ibanez, but it is an exact clone including the same component values, potentiometers, ICs (JRC), etc"}
{"source": "For proof that it is exactly the same, I was able to modify it for different frequency response (corner frequency), and add asymmetrical clipping with the exact same components in exactly the same spot in the circuit as seen in TS9 mods"}
{"source": " Of course the board is layed out a little differently"}
{"source": "The only reason I gave it 4 (really 4"}
{"source": "5) stars was because it does produce some noticeable noise (hiss) at higher gains, but this is expected given the boosting stage acts like a high pass filter (this gives it the characteristic mid-range boost)"}
{"source": " It can be cut with the tone control, but it also may have been due to a poorly shielded amplifier, and or a one-spot power adapter"}
{"source": "If you need an 808 Clone on the Cheap this is your pedal"}
{"source": " Don't be fooled though, it does not school the classic Tube Screamer but it holds its own"}
{"source": " This was a main staple on my pedalboard until I found a great deal on a Bad Monkey and then sadly it came off"}
{"source": " I was not looking to replace it at the time, it just happened the Bad Money did what I needed it to do better"}
{"source": "I recommend this pedal to everyone and anyone who needs an 808 but has the budget of your average gigging musician :)"}
{"source": "Maxon 808 $150"}
{"source": "00Ibanez TS9 $100Joyo Vintage OD $50"}
{"source": "This is a really nice, sturdy pedal with a really warm tone"}
{"source": " I have a Marshall MG15CFX solid state amp"}
{"source": " This pedal sounds really good on the clean channel, but you can hear that it is not designed for a solid state dirty channel"}
{"source": " It has given me another tool in my toolbox and basically added a 5th channel to my 4 channel Marshall"}
{"source": " Great classic rock 70's tone! It responds really well to my pick attack"}
{"source": " You really can't go wrong for the money"}
{"source": "I wanted to add to my pedal arsenal, but I didn't have the big bucks to spend on a Tube Screamer"}
{"source": " So, I took a chance on this little stomp-box from China"}
{"source": "  It compares itself to the TS, right on the box, and for good reason"}
{"source": "  They use the same chip"}
{"source": " More importantly, the construction is solid, good looking, and takes up minimal pedal-board space"}
{"source": "  The on-off switch seems a little chintzy, but the tone that comes out of this thing is awesome"}
{"source": " I only found that out after replacing the dead battery that it comes with, and plugging in to a power supply (not provided with unit)"}
{"source": "  It turned my partscaster into a blues making machine"}
{"source": " It's responds well to your technique, and you can make it so funky, you can smell it!  It truly does have true bypass, and logical controls"}
{"source": "  I don't have A TS to make direct comparisons, but for the money, this little pedal gives me exactly the tone I want"}
{"source": "  And I saved about 70 or 80 bucks"}
{"source": "  Ba-Da Bing!"}
{"source": "There is no shortage of \"Tubescreamer clones\" on the market for guitarists in search of that warm overdriven tube sound perfect for blues, jazz, and rock"}
{"source": "  The DigiTech Bad Monkey is one such example"}
{"source": "  But the Chinese-made Joyo JF-01 Vintage Distortion just be the best, and it's half the price of a TS-9"}
{"source": "About the manufacturer - Joyo hit the market a couple of years back and has now released about a couple dozen pedals that utilize their own form factor (very similar to an MXR in size and switch) but \"cloning\" the circuitry of well-known classic and modern boutique effects pedals"}
{"source": "  Some people jump to conclusions about Chinese products, but don't just take it from me - do your homework"}
{"source": "  The response to these pedals has been overwhelmingly positive, and there are great vendors/distributors within the U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": " that test them out and can ship them to you within a few days"}
{"source": "  I'm definitely a fan of Joyo products"}
{"source": "As for the \"Vintage Distortion\" itself, people have said it's based on either a TS-9 or the (more expensive) TS-808"}
{"source": "  Frankly, while the latter is apparently warmer (and less mid-range heavy) than the former, I'm not sure there's any significant difference"}
{"source": "  I played this JF-01 side by side with my TS-9, and it's probably one of the more exact \"clones\" in the Joyo lineup"}
{"source": "  For example, the Joyo \"Ultimate Drive\" is an excellent (higher-gain) overdrive pedal based on a Fulltone OCD, but you can still notice differences in the resulting sound and settings required to get there (some of which are arguably BETTER than the original)"}
{"source": "  With the settings matched, the JF-01 performed almost exactly like the TS-9 in level, gain, and tone"}
{"source": "  There probably is little more gain available on this pedal with that knob cranked full, which isn't a bad thing"}
{"source": "  It's very responsive to your playing style and, again, it sounds like a Tubescreamer"}
{"source": "I'll probably be keeping my Tubescreamer, if only because it's an iconic pedal that performs well"}
{"source": "  But it's superior in name only - if I had to use the Joyo Vintage Overdrive in its place, I'd be no worse for the wear"}
{"source": "  5 stars, highly recommended!"}
{"source": "I ended up returning it and bought a cheaper generic model as the other one has better effect for less than half the price"}
{"source": "  This unit is of high quality, though"}
{"source": "This is the American DJ Micro Galaxian red & green laser"}
{"source": " It is the smaller version of the Galaxian laser with the same laser power output, but a smaller beam spread"}
{"source": " It is a compact well built unit with a power switch on the back and a small fan to keep it cool"}
{"source": " The small power cord plugs into the back of the unit and has a transformer block on the end of the cord"}
{"source": " It comes with a remote that works great, but has an antenna to pull up if needed, which seems like old technology"}
{"source": " The remote has 4 buttons which allows you to select auto/sound mode, blackout, color and direction of rotation"}
{"source": " When going through the color modes you can select red, green, red/green together or red/green changing and flashing"}
{"source": " You can select auto mode or sound mode so it will go with the music"}
{"source": " There is also a speed control knob on the back of the laser to have the dots stop completely, move very fast or slow"}
{"source": " The darker the room the better, but you can easily see it in any room with the lights on"}
{"source": " I am very pleased with it"}
{"source": " I havent tried it with fog but I know it would look great since it has 200 beams"}
{"source": " It will work great for any DJ to use on the dancefloor, wall or ceiling"}
{"source": " This is a great buy under $100"}
{"source": "PROS: It is small, bright, well built and works great"}
{"source": " It has a remote to control it"}
{"source": "CONS: Transformer on cord and antenna on remote"}
{"source": "I tried this about 3 months ago"}
{"source": " I use Fender 150L's and with it the longevity doubles"}
{"source": " I play every day and gig one or two nights"}
{"source": " They normally go dead in a week or less"}
{"source": " I just did my 3rd weekend with the same set"}
{"source": " I put it on when necessary on gig breaks"}
{"source": " After practicing, I wipe down the strings first with a cloth and fretboard, then I put the Slick on"}
{"source": " Next day, it's not so oily that it bothers me since I don't care for that oily feeling"}
{"source": " I just ordered 2 more of these"}
{"source": " Obviously, I think it a good product"}
{"source": "Update about 2 years later: I won't do without these"}
{"source": " They are part of my rig and I always have an extra at home in case it is time to change"}
{"source": " They also last quite a long time, maybe 7 months"}
{"source": "Purchased this for my son who plays both Acoustic and Electric guitars"}
{"source": " He's absolutely thrilled and loves this cleaner! Great buy, prompt shipping, great product!"}
{"source": "It was great to get quality Christmas gifts that my son was pleased with"}
{"source": " The budding musician in our home was glad to receive this item as we do not have a music store in our town"}
{"source": " So thanks to Amazon for making this possible"}
{"source": "Using the string cleaner on a regular basis helps to prolong string life and keeps your guitar sounding bright and full"}
{"source": " A repeat buy!"}
{"source": "I can't say much about this product"}
{"source": "  I tried it twice"}
{"source": "  It seemed like it kind of cleaned the strings, but I really didn't notice any great change"}
{"source": "  The strings didn't sound betteer or brighter"}
{"source": "  Now, it sits in my drawer and collects dust"}
{"source": "  Maybe I will try it again at some point, but"}
{"source": "I agree with the others - I've been using Fast Fret for over 20 years (and Finger Ease spray for over 40), but I believe Slick is a better product"}
{"source": "  I give it just 4 stars, though, due to its design"}
{"source": " The wiping cloth that comes with Slick is meant to fit in a small plastic ziplock bag inside the cap, but it's difficult to get the cloth back inside the small bag, and it's bulky inside the cap, making it a little difficult to close with the cloth inside the cap"}
{"source": " It would be easier to close if the cap side was deeper; the way it's designed now, the cap and the applicator are equally sized, when they needn't be"}
{"source": " That's a small gripe, though - if I could give it 4-1/2 stars (with half a star off for the design), I would - it's great stuff"}
{"source": "I requested and received one of these as a Christmas gift, then bought another so I could keep the first one at a weekend place where I keep a guitar"}
{"source": " It works quickly and easily to swipe on the strings, and keeps strings clean and rust-free (important here in humid Florida) and strings last longer than they did before I started using this even though I've always wiped the strings with a soft cloth after each use"}
{"source": "I keep my Slick string cleaner in a quart size ziploc-type bag because it's not airtight when you snap it together and I don't want it to dry out"}
{"source": " I hope when it does dry out that I can just add some juice to rejuvenate it"}
{"source": " I just don't know what kind of liquid to use"}
{"source": " I don't want to drop $8 or so for a new one every time it dries out"}
{"source": " Any ideas are welcome, please add a comment to this review if you can help me out"}
{"source": "Bottom line, it extends the life of my strings and that's always good"}
{"source": "I honestly don't see the purpose"}
{"source": "  It doesn't seem to have improved my experience with my strings on my guitar"}
{"source": "  I've used it a few times, but don't see the benefit"}
{"source": "Edit 5/30/13:After coming back to read the other reviews, it's obvious what happened:  This was shipped to me completely dry"}
{"source": "  There was no grease/lubricant qualities"}
{"source": "  It was like a dry erase pad"}
{"source": "  They need to improve their quality control"}

{"source": "  This is that device"}

{"source": "  In addition, this one has a metronome"}
{"source": "  I like this very much, and may well buy another"}
{"source": "Enjoy!"}
{"source": "This product has a quiet metronome; in a playing environment, it won't be easy to hear"}

{"source": "Great product, great price"}
{"source": "The tuner doesn't require you to hear either it or the guitar or bass to tune it, so it will work pretty well in a noisy/social environment"}
{"source": " Overall, works just fine"}
{"source": "This is definately worth the money"}
{"source": " I was looking for a metronome and got this awesome unit that does it all"}
{"source": " Bought another one for my friend!"}

{"source": " The metronome feature is also a nice addition"}
{"source": " It's a bit lightweight, making it seem like it wont last very long if even dropped once, but it hit the floor many times on me already and it's still going strong :-) This is a great tuner at an even better price, try it out and see for yourself!"}

{"source": "I upgraded my review based on the replacement I received"}
{"source": "see below"}
{"source": "I purchased this amp locally and initially, I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds"}
{"source": " This was my first Fender amp as well"}
{"source": "The presets were neat and all, but when I played around with some of the \"standard\" models (just the amp model, no effects) just to see how it's clean sound was, the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max"}
{"source": " The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on"}
{"source": " I've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it, even when there was no guitar plugged in"}
{"source": " All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes; very distracting and it drove me nuts! This isn't a ground loop issue (my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond), it's clearly a defect with this product"}
{"source": " Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse, again, even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume"}
{"source": " You'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil, but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS"}
{"source": " WTF?The next issue is the weird \"fizz\" sound, that was especially noticeable on the low e"}
{"source": " After striking a string, instead of a clean note, there's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that \"surrounds\" the note, and fades as the string stops moving"}
{"source": " It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency"}
{"source": " Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable"}
{"source": "The weird thing is, neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in, or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in"}
{"source": " but I'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans"}
{"source": " I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12\" Celestion speaker"}
{"source": "Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues"}
{"source": " Apparently, the Mustang I and II don't have these issues, and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp"}
{"source": " Is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? There is speculation that the LCD screen (which is not present on the I or II) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and Fender doesn't seem to care"}
{"source": "Definitely try this before you buy it"}
{"source": " You may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good"}
{"source": "This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage"}
{"source": " I am disappointed that Fender hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong, but I'm not taking that as a fact"}
{"source": "), but they have acknowledged that there is \"something\" wrong"}
{"source": "Whatever"}
{"source": " I took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead"}
{"source": " Guess what? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz, even when cranked"}
{"source": " How about that? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise"}
{"source": "I'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that I'd like to try"}
{"source": " But before I buy another Fender amp, I'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds"}

{"source": " I also have a ZT Lunchbox that I use for church work (miles of clean headroom and designed specifically for pedals)"}
{"source": " The Mustang III would work just fine, but I can throw the ZT in a backpack with my pedals (I only use an OD, chorus and reverb for church) and it has a lot more volume of I do youth group stuff outside and can't mic up"}
{"source": "I have several friends that play music as a primary source of income and 3 of them purchased the Mustang for it's overall lightweight, terrific sound and low price"}
{"source": " Played on the clean channels (settings 88-99) with pedals will give you an amazing tone that lets you forget it's not a tube amp - and for the most part, the crowd is clueless to begin with"}
{"source": " I did purchase the VOX AC4 and it was so one dimensional and limited it went right back"}
{"source": " Terrific for gigs or practice, a back up or just beginning guitar"}
{"source": "So this is the 3rd amp I've purchased in a very short amount of time"}
{"source": " I traded in my Line 6 and also purchased a Roland Micro Cube"}
{"source": " Chalk it up to a new guitar player and a whole world of amplifiers from every price range and style"}
{"source": " I bought the Line 6 becuase it had a lot of features and presets that I thought would be really fun"}
{"source": " They are, but Line 6 is for metal, despite \"You can play anything on it\" marketing"}
{"source": " Turns out I really enjoy playing country and blues (although I listen to punk, classic rock and metal (pre-1995)"}
{"source": "Enter the Mustang III"}
{"source": " It also is feature loaded, but with one kicker"}
{"source": " The models of the vintage Fender amps"}
{"source": " I have a very close friend that plays a 65' Twin Reverb - he was shocked at the modeling"}
{"source": " The Bassman is another that is just off the charts good"}
{"source": " The LCD screen is bigger and overall very simple to use"}
{"source": " The Vox model is also really jangly sounding - like it's supposed to"}
{"source": " I have to add that with Vox in particular, you can get the crunch without having to use massive volume"}
{"source": " This is true of modeling amps across the board and a huge advantage over tubes in general"}
{"source": " For $300 you can get a Vox w/ an overdrive, delay and reverb"}
{"source": " And you can get the full effect with the volume dialed to 3, not 11"}
{"source": " It doesn't sound exactly like a Vox - but I don't gig"}
{"source": " I'm a basement rockstar - the Mustang gets it done without any problems"}
{"source": "Adding virtual effect pedals and saving the settings are easy and intuitive"}
{"source": " That's without the FUSE software"}
{"source": " I'm not big into recording, so I'm content using it from the  LCD, but the Fuse software is slick"}
{"source": " The virtual pedal board is probably my favorite part of the amp"}
{"source": " The screen is easy to navigate and you can see exactly what effects you're using where they are set at"}
{"source": "The only reason I've given it 4 stars is beacuse is lacks low end punch and more importantly doesn't quite have the warmth of a tube amp"}
{"source": " To be clear - tube amps sound like tube amps"}
{"source": " If you are a metal guy on a solid state budget, Line 6 is still the way to go"}
{"source": " If you're more into the old school r'n'r sounds, take a look at the Mustang III"}
{"source": " Excellent sounds and value"}
{"source": "I gave it five stars! I purchased this for my young son but I find myself drawn to it because of all the really great things this amp does"}
{"source": "  I wanted something flexible and decided to buy the Mustang III over the II because of the power and the larger speaker"}
{"source": "I've read the reviews here and they pretty much sum up what I think about the amp"}
{"source": " It sounds great and it has loads of power"}
{"source": "  Since it's solid-state, it falls apart a bit when pushed really hard and lacks a little at the bottom end, but for this price?!? Wow! I have no complaints"}
{"source": "One thing most have failed to mention is the non-amp features like the input for an MP3 player and the Fuse software that comes with the amp for customizing tones, creating jam tracks and setting up the amp to suit his tastes"}
{"source": " Both Mac and Windows are supported"}
{"source": " My son is a newer guitarist and has used these things extensively"}
{"source": " Since he's 11, he doesn't have many opportunities to play with others"}
{"source": " He can create jam/click tracks and play along"}
{"source": " We also downloaded new firmware from Fender and used the software to eliminate a fizz issue that existed in earlier versions"}
{"source": "People who own this amp can create their own tones and tracks, then upload them to Fender's user web site"}
{"source": " We watched a David Gilmour concert and he was inspired"}
{"source": " He wanted a tone that sounded like his"}
{"source": " We downloaded a few Pink Floyd tones created by other people"}
{"source": "  One of them was particularly great"}
{"source": " We tweaked the delay settings a bit and saved it"}
{"source": "  He loves it"}
{"source": "Great amp"}
{"source": " I can't compare to Line 6 but I can compare it to other amps I've heard"}
{"source": " It's pretty nice"}
{"source": "  Equally nice is the fact he can experiment with tones without spending a pile of $$$ on FX"}
{"source": "ConstructionThis Amp certainly looks sharp"}
{"source": " It is not nearly as heavy as I would expect a 100W amp to be, but seems well put together"}
{"source": "ControlsThe III comes with a 2 button Foot Pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly"}
{"source": " (You can expand to add an optional 4 button switch that Fender sells separately and also includes in the IV and V"}
{"source": ")On the amp, you have separate EQ knobs (Treble, Mids and Low) you have a gain, a volume, a Master Volume and a Reverb"}
{"source": " Along with these, you also have an LCD screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals, presets, delays and reverbs"}
{"source": " You also have separate buttons for changing Amp models, reverb, delays and modulation effects"}
{"source": " The large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets, and once you press it, you can go into deep editing of the amp models, effects and presets"}
{"source": "The controls are intuitive and easy to use"}
{"source": " It is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs"}
{"source": "Comparing to other amps:The Fender GDEC 3 does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself"}
{"source": " You need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly"}
{"source": " But on the Mustang III, you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer"}
{"source": "I don't know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful"}
{"source": "The Sound (Most important)Let me first compare this amp to what Line 6, Vox, and Peavy have offered in the past"}
{"source": " All of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects"}
{"source": " BUT"}
{"source": " How many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them? Line 6 offers tons of sounds"}
{"source": " most of them are what I would call \"niche\" sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro, or some crazy effects laden sound"}
{"source": " What I find with Line 6 is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed"}
{"source": " They don't sound overdriven, they just sound distorted"}
{"source": " Also, Line 6 offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock, metal, and maybe even some weird jazz fusion"}
{"source": " These sounds are unique and interesting, but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that I love and looking for useful rock, blues, and metal tones"}
{"source": "What I can say about the Mustang III is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed"}
{"source": " The Vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds"}
{"source": " These are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the Real Thing"}
{"source": " You can find the actual base amp models in memory banks 88-99"}
{"source": " By playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps"}
{"source": " A few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are:'57 Champ This amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little 8 inch Champ"}
{"source": " Tons of character and tone"}
{"source": " You can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model"}
{"source": " Think the Jimi Blues cd"}
{"source": " The presets that use this amp that Fender created are all really fun and sound amazing"}
{"source": "Fender Bassman Wow! You can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model"}
{"source": " It has the recognizable tone of the Bassman modeled really well"}
{"source": " Big Bold bottom end with some singing highs"}
{"source": "'65 Deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model"}
{"source": " Throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock/blues"}
{"source": " Or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone"}
{"source": "The British Amps are all good models of Vox and Marshall type amps"}
{"source": " They are all bold and in your face"}
{"source": " Just play one ACDC riff into the 70's amp and you'll recognize the sound"}
{"source": "As far as the Vintage tones go"}
{"source": "I dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere"}
{"source": " If you play rock, blues, Country, hard rock or Jazz, you have so many great choices"}
{"source": " People who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs"}
{"source": "What surprises me is that Fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music"}
{"source": " I was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good"}
{"source": "I was wrong"}
{"source": " The 90's stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it"}
{"source": " I'm pretty sure that this is a Mesa Boogie type of model"}
{"source": " This is certainly your Metallica amp"}
{"source": "The 2000 metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too"}
{"source": "The BIG bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the SuperSonic"}
{"source": " This amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal, thrash or whatever"}
{"source": " If you overdrive it with a built in pedal, you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this"}
{"source": " I play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that I like"}
{"source": " I personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this SuperSonic amp"}
{"source": "The fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones"}
{"source": " You can have one guy who sets all 100 presets with vintage tones, and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash"}
{"source": " It is limitless"}
{"source": "I would, without a doubt choose this amp over ANY modeling amp out there for practice and fun"}
{"source": "I own a pimped out MIM Strat, and a off-the-rack Classic Vibe Strat and Tele as well as a Les Paul style guitar"}
{"source": " They ALL sound very cool on this amp"}
{"source": " The Classic Vibe 60's Strat really impresses me through this amp"}
{"source": " So versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound"}
{"source": " I am really loving it!This amp can play really really loud with it's 100 Watts, but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes"}
{"source": " (I have 4 kids and practice at night, and this amp is perfect"}
{"source": ")Fender Fuse and Ableton SoftwareI have to admit that I really don't feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what I can do manually on the amp"}
{"source": " However, You'll find amazing tones all over the Fender Fuse"}
{"source": " The system is super easy to use and store on your amp"}
{"source": " As with any open online forum, you will have to wade through tones that you don't love and aren't described well"}

{"source": " Perfect"}

{"source": " I have a $300 strat that I love that sounds beautiful through it"}
{"source": " After buying it, I have listed a Tube amp and several effects pedals that I have loved because I no longer will play it"}

{"source": " I have several guitars, and always thought Epiphone to be an inferior guitar"}
{"source": " Well I was dead wrong"}
{"source": " It may not have the price tag of my \"better\" guitars, but it sure has the playability and sound"}
{"source": " Especially for the $100 tag on it"}
{"source": " Great for beginners or a seasoned player to add to his collection"}
{"source": " The simple, yet killer sound of the single humbucker is hard to beat"}

{"source": " The noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup"}
{"source": " I run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig, when using fuzz and distortion"}
{"source": "It does what is supposed to, i'ts a gate, and clamps the noise as good as I expected, at the begining I had problems with power, some how it didn't power correctly, but I was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain, so I solved it isolating the MXR connecting it with another power supply, and it work, so I left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine, also check config and the routing of the signal, this might influence on how it works, I have it right after my Wha and before my compressor, and it works just fine"}
{"source": "I use this every now and then, it does seem to suck tone, but it does reduce noise, though I actually stopped using it and didn't hear much difference! with distortion and reverb, things can get a little noisy in there, but the original tone with everything set up is worth it unaltered"}
{"source": " but I will keep this as it will come in handy one day I'm sure"}
{"source": "I couldn't be happier with this pedal"}
{"source": " I have a Les Paul/Marshall Class 5/BB preamp/EP Booster/Analog Chorus and Carbon Copy"}
{"source": " I used to get this annoying hum and feedback when I cranked the amp up, even when I just plugged the guitar straight to the amp, but those days are long gone, now everything is nice and quiet"}
{"source": " I even have the trigger knob all the way down and it still does its job, I haven't noticed any difference in tone so far"}
{"source": " I was scared that the Smart Gate was a better option but this one has worked like a charm and it's cheaper, not to mention it has its own effects loop"}
{"source": " I don't understand how the Noise Supressor or the Decimator could be better than this one, I mean, the pedal will get rid of the noise yes or no"}
{"source": "I don't really care for the FX loop on my Fender Supersonic Head, as I started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the MXR pedals"}
{"source": " so when this came out last year I snatched one up and started experimenting with it"}
{"source": " I LOVE it, bypassed I still get that in your face strait into an amp sound, but ingage it with my delays and phase 90's and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss"}
{"source": " very cool, and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank"}
{"source": "Item shipped earlier than I've expected"}
{"source": " When I opened the box was surprised as I didn't notice the usb cable"}
{"source": " But later I thought that it was impossible and opened the box from another side and here it was"}
{"source": "I have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds"}
{"source": " It is working fine"}
{"source": " Though it has no motorized faders, it doesn't make my work uncomfortable at all"}
{"source": " I have connected it to a Reaper and Protools software and it's just working perfect!I recommend it to home studios, also those who travel with recording gear"}
{"source": " Nano is small but quite durable"}
{"source": "I am happy with it!"}
{"source": "Great product for the price!I am using it with Win7 64bit & Sonar XL Producer"}
{"source": "I just held down the \"set-marker\" & \"record\" button while plugging the usb cable"}
{"source": "I then let Windows 7 Plug & Play the Drivers (No Disk Needed)"}
{"source": "Next I set Sonar XL Midi Control Surface device as MACKIE & selected the nanoKontrol2 as the Control -Midi in and out"}
{"source": "Now I have 8 channels of automation & stop, back, record, play etc"}
{"source": "I am very happy with this product so far"}

{"source": "Buttons and sliders and great for the price"}
{"source": "Cheers"}
{"source": "TC is very overrated"}
{"source": "Many pedals I have out performs this in my opinion"}
{"source": "  The vintage BBDs (MXR Vintage DElay, Morley 70's echo) for example just take it"}
{"source": "  But for newer pedals I liked the MXR Carbon Copy and Ibanex DE 7 much better"}
{"source": "I have been through a few delay pedals trying to get the sound I want"}
{"source": "1) Boss digital delay: I really didn't like the sound of the delay overall"}
{"source": " No real positives to mention2) Carbon copy analog delay : Worked great for cleans"}
{"source": " But totally muddied up my lead distortion tone (even though it was in my fx loop)"}
{"source": " I couldn't get the repeats to duck under the main signal3) Nova Delay : I really wanted to like this"}
{"source": " Presets, tap tempo and a nice feature set"}
{"source": " But the sound just lacked warmth"}
{"source": " It was very digital soundingAt this point I wasn't sure what I wanted"}
{"source": " Analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy"}
{"source": " Digital delays were clear sounding but"}
{"source": " just too digital and uninspiring!I was debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline, when I found this pedal"}
{"source": " Analog dry signal thru with digital delay !! This is what the magic sauce is in my opinion"}
{"source": " Now my signal has the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved"}
{"source": " Set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect"}
{"source": " Sure, it doesn't have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay, this can't be beat at this price range"}
{"source": "Sure enough, when I checked the strymon timeline specs, I found out that it too has the analog dry through with digital delay"}
{"source": " Just that its delays may be modeled better and it has a rich feature set"}
{"source": " But $450+ for a delay pedal is just too much for me"}
{"source": "Buy this if you are chasing tone, you won't be disappointed"}
{"source": " Skip if looking for presets, tap tempo etc"}
{"source": "Smart design, excellent performance"}
{"source": "  What more could you want?  The Samson Meteor Mic USB Studio Microphone is a cardioid mic that is easy to set up and use, with great pick up for desktop podcasts, user testing, screencasting and similar"}
{"source": "Being a relatively new user to anything but a basic desk mic, I had to look up what 'cardioid' meant"}
{"source": "  I found a solid explanation at a site called WiseGeek"}
{"source": "  They explain 'cardioid':  \"Several different microphones have been designed throughout the years to accomplish very different tasks"}
{"source": " Some -- such as condenser microphones -- pick up a great deal of sound from several directions, while others pick up one focused sound only from one direction"}
{"source": " Of this latter group, the cardioid microphone is perhaps the most popular, as it picks up almost exclusively the desired sound while ambient noise is hardly noticeable"}
{"source": " It gets its name because of its pattern of sensitivity, which is roughly shaped like a heart when drawn out on an axis"}
{"source": " This means that most of the sound it picks up comes from the front of the microphone, while minimal noise is picked up from the rear and only marginal noise is picked up from the sides"}
{"source": "\"  (My apologies to those pros out there who didn't need this clarification"}
{"source": ")Having used the Samson Go Mic USB Compact Mic for a few months, I was familiar with the Samson brand prior to receiving this mic through the Amazon Vine program"}
{"source": "  I had actually wanted to purchase it instead of the Go Mic, but the price difference of about thirty was a bit too much for me at the time"}
{"source": "I've been happy with theSamson Go Mic Compact USB Microphone - Plug n' Playfor use with my desktop and laptop PCs"}
{"source": "  I do a lot of usability testing for various websites, and it's imperative that clients are able to clearly hear my explanations via voice without background noise, pops, hisses or similar"}
{"source": "  I have to say that the Samson Meteor is a touch better, offering clear, crisp recording and reproduction"}
{"source": "  It also seems to pick up virtually no background noise, which is fabulous!I like the retro styling of the Meteor, and the built-in stand is great for desktops"}
{"source": "  Less portable than the Samson Go Mic, the stand does fold neatly onto the mic for easy transport in the included soft pouch"}
{"source": "  The included USB cable is also of ample length for easy set-up in a multitude of situations"}
{"source": "The mute button on the front of the Meteor is very handy"}
{"source": "  Much easier than using software to get the job done, and an amber light makes it easy to recognize it's muted"}
{"source": "The build quality of the mic is excellent! Very solid, high-end feel"}
{"source": "  You can use the integrated headset port to monitor your voice and adjust levels with a dial that rotates around the mute button on the front"}
{"source": "The Samson Meteor didn't ship with any software, which while unnecessary for installation (my Windows 7 and 8 PCs automatically installed it when hooked up via the included USB), but would have been nice to have some music mixing or other similar software bundled with it"}
{"source": "Another product I'm reviewing the:Samson C01UCW Studio USB Mic with Cakewalk Sonar LEand the Samson Go Mic both ship with Cakewalk software"}
{"source": " The Samson Go Mic with Cakewalk Music Creator LE, and the C01UCW ships with Cakewalk's SONAR LE software, so I found it kind of surprising the Meteor did not at this price point"}

{"source": "Overall, I'm very pleased with this microphone and will be using it instead of the Go Mic on my desktop for daily work which will include using Dragon voice recognition software"}
{"source": "  I have purchased an adapter to use it with my iPad so I can play with Garage Band, and know it will be great for future screencasts"}
{"source": "My only disappointment is in the lack of an included software package, which other Samson products (as mentioned) have packaged with them"}
{"source": " I give this product 4 out of 5 stars (\"I Like It\") for this reason"}
{"source": "  If Samson included software - it'd be a 5 star product for me"}
{"source": "Perhaps more than anything else, it was the introduction and subsequent success of the Zoom H2 personal digital recorder that led to an explosion of interest among home audiophiles, who suddenly found themselves equipped to make quasi-professional-level recordings with their computers plus a minimum of user-friendly equipment at reasonable prices"}
{"source": "  The price of the Samson Meteor USB mic, a fairly recent entry, has come down to the point of being fairly valued (initially, I was seeing it going for prices above the better-sounding Blue Yeti mic)"}
{"source": "  It's an attractive (some would say \"cute\") little mic with its quaint \"retro\" design and deceptively fold-up, portable size"}
{"source": "  I say \"deceptive\" because, due to the non-adjustable mic stand, it can be more than a little challenging to find space for it on a desktop, next to a computer, and squarely in front of the narrator's mouth"}
{"source": "Bearing in mind the above reservation along with the actual quality of the recorded sound (it's good, but nowhere close to studio-quality), it would seem to make the most sense for those seeking \"high fidelity\" audio to spend the extra 20% for a Blue Yeti or an Audio Technica AT2020 USB (as tempting as the lower price of the non-USB version of the AT2020 is, be sure to try it out with a pre-amp supplying phantom power before going that route"}

{"source": "If your primary considerations are convenience and portability, the Samson Go mic sounds almost as good as the Meteor and is unmatched in size, convenience and portability"}
{"source": "  (It scored higher than the Blue Mikey and Blue Snowflake in my auditions"}
{"source": ")  I'm tempted to say it's the perfect laptop mic, clipping to the top cover more securely than the Snowflake, whereas the Yeti is ideal for desktop use, producing rich-sounding recordings rivaling those of a professional studio's Shure SM7B mics"}
{"source": "Just got this today and I'm experiencing serious install issues"}
{"source": " Please note that I'm not a newbie to this stuff"}
{"source": " I'm an IT guy"}
{"source": " I have a new Acer computer that's less than 3 months old with a new install of Windows 7"}
{"source": " The mic is recognized, but not as a sound input device, just as an \"Other USB Device\""}
{"source": " I tried installing it on another laptop and it installed quickly and easily, so it's not that the mic itself doesn't work"}
{"source": "My purpose in posting this is to let people considering this mic know that you can't just assume that the install is a no-brain'r (at least not on a PC)"}
{"source": " The Samson tech support was friendly enough, but not very helpful"}
{"source": " They had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support"}
{"source": " The support guy said, \"well, that's really all there is to it\", which I can understand"}
{"source": "but I still have a $70 mic that won't work with my computer"}
{"source": " I tried contacting Microsoft tech support and they tried to help me too, but we could never get the mic to be seen as an input device"}
{"source": " We tried it a number of ways and nothing worked"}
{"source": "I ordered this for use with my iPad as well, and I ordered the \"camera kit\" to do so"}
{"source": " Despite what I'd seen in the reviews and videos online, the mic I received would work not with that either"}
{"source": " The Mic needs to be powered by the iPad and it seemed mine was not getting enough power from the iPad because the little indicator light was still Amber when plugged in (indicating it's not getting enough power) instead of Blue"}
{"source": "I tried this on my wife's iPad and my daughter's too so it would not appear to be the iPad that is the problem (though it could be the camera connector, I suppose"}
{"source": ")So"}
{"source": "I ended up returning the whole shooting match"}
{"source": " Disappointing too"}
{"source": "I really like the design of the mic and so many people say that it sounds so good"}
{"source": "This bag includes several different thicknesses of picks so you can see which fits your playing style best, and the varied colors means the more vain of us can color coordinate our pick and instrument"}
{"source": "A little disappointed with the cable"}
{"source": "  Pretty light weight"}
{"source": "  Don't know why it didn't work, just shorted out"}
{"source": "  Luckily one of the band members had another one"}
{"source": "  Wouldn't trust it again, so I returned them"}
{"source": "Just skimming through the other reviews, I see that at least one other reviewer has complained about the same thing"}
{"source": " Nearly every time you pick up your guitar, the rest will fall off your desk"}
{"source": " The part that sits on the desk should've been weighted to prevent this from happening"}
{"source": " It's a nice idea and does what it says - it keeps your guitar nice and safe from scuffs when leaned up against your desk"}
{"source": "But considering this one REALLY annoying flaw, I wonder if I shouldn't have just payed a couple more bucks for another guitar stand instead of this rest"}
{"source": "The Planet Waves Guitar Rest works for ukuleles!  I just got one, and have used it for a few days, and it's the bomb!  I can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over"}
{"source": "  This product is a rubber disc with small \"arms\" in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface, and you can set your instrument against it, and voila, it doesn't fall over!  Here at home, I use it on the second shelf of a bookcase, and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove, heel on carpet, neck in Guitar Rest"}
{"source": "I'm going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases, because I can use them at one of my uke parties"}
{"source": "  If one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor, for instance, to take a whizz, they're just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them"}

{"source": "  It's quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument"}
{"source": "  I could carry a metal stand with me, but it wouldn't fit in my ukulele case--this Planet Waves product does"}
{"source": "  A winner"}
{"source": "I just can't trust it! I thought it'd be a good idea if I needed to prop my guitar up against the amp for a minute"}
{"source": "but I just can't get myself to do it"}
{"source": " I always end up using a little Fender portable stand"}
{"source": " It does make a nice coaster for placing a beer on my amp"}
{"source": "This product is worth having if, like me, you find yourself needing a place to quickly \"park\" your guitar without putting it back in the guitar stand"}
{"source": " I use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand"}
{"source": " Works great -- only suggestion I have it to perhaps make a version with a sticky tape underside, or a way of semi-permanently attaching it the spot where you want it so it doesn't move around"}
{"source": " I wound up using a very small wood screw to attach it to my desk so it stays fixed"}
{"source": " Overall -- I like it"}
{"source": "This is a great value for a practice and travel instrument"}
{"source": "(I got mine with free shipping)Built like an instrument, not a toy, it is an interesting crossover between a high strung guitar and ukelele"}
{"source": " Fun to play, easy to take along, stays in tune well enough, and it's only a hundred bucks"}
{"source": " I bet if you bought one you would like it"}
{"source": "I bought my Yamaha guitarlele about 2 years ago from Long & McQuade located in Canada"}
{"source": "  It's the same as the one Amazon is selling here"}
{"source": "  I teach classical guitar but have always loved the sound of ukulele"}
{"source": "  My reason for buying this is because I don't have to learn how to play the ukulele and can play the guitarlele using the knowledge I already have - yea!It is very similar to a guitar in many important ways"}
{"source": "  It has the same 6 strings tuned the same way"}
{"source": "  However, and this is VERY important so please read carefully:  To get the best sound out of your new guitarlele you must tune each string up in pitch"}
{"source": "  For example, let's take the 6th string (lowest) and tune it up to A instead of E"}
{"source": "  Clip on your electronic guitar tuner and crank that string up a bit until the tuner reads \"A\""}
{"source": "  It will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar"}
{"source": "So here's the breakdown on tuning each string:6th = A5th = D4th = G3rd = C2nd = E1st = AYou really need to to tune it this way because otherwise the strings are too floppy and you won't get that beautiful ukulele voice"}
{"source": "  The action is very good and it will not be any harder to play"}
{"source": "The instrument overall is fairly easy to play, especially in the lower positions"}
{"source": "  I have trouble holding it because I'm used to holding a classical guitar so I always have to make adjustments to get used to it"}
{"source": "  Barring chords especially higher up the neck is kind of tough because the frets are so close together so I usually play easier stuff"}
{"source": "  Also, I have discovered that certain types of music really play well and others aren't so good"}
{"source": "  Almost all Celtic music sounds great!  Christmas carols are lovely, but Spanish stuff doesn't sound so great, imho"}
{"source": "  The instrument just doesn't have enough power to carry some types of music"}
{"source": "  Blues are good, and very ancient sounding tunes like those that would have been played on a 4 course guitar from back around the 15th century sound really cool on the guitarlele"}
{"source": "  It seems to be well constructed, the tuning gears work well, the action is good, frets are inserted straight and level so I really can't find anything to complain about, especially for the price"}
{"source": "I would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun!  It's just like a little guitar with all the same strings and same number of frets"}
{"source": " You will probably have to tie a strap on it to hold it in place but that's not absolutely necessary, especially for those of you who are accustomed to playing small stringed instruments"}
{"source": "I took it camping over the summer and had a great time playing it around the campfire in the evenings, something I've always wanted to do!  I'm quite fond of my guitarlele and am going to purchase another for my daughter so that we can play duets together on them!  :DUPDATE 4"}
{"source": "10"}
{"source": "13-------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought another guitarlele (this time from Amazon) and it is exactly like the one I purchased a few years ago"}
{"source": "  This one is for my daughter and she is having a delightful time playing it"}
{"source": "  We've been playing guitarlele duets together and they sound great and is such a fun thing to do!"}
{"source": "The Yamaha guitalele sounds absolutely beautiful"}
{"source": " It's like a mini classical guitar, except the recommended tuning is A-D-G-C-E-A (A-D, followed by the standard G-C-E-A tuning on a 4-string Ukulele), but it can also be turned to E-A-D-G-B-E (standard tuning on a guitar)"}
{"source": "On the standard tuning for a guitar, however, the strings sound a little floppy"}
{"source": " A reviewer suggested using an extra hard, high tension string like theD'Addario Extra Hard Tension Classical Guitar Stringsto get around the floppiness on the E-A-D-G-B-E turning"}
{"source": " You can use a capo with this instrument"}
{"source": " MyKyser Capoworks on it just fine"}
{"source": "The guitalele measures 27-1/2\" x 9\" x 2-3/4\" at their widest points"}
{"source": " The construction quality on my copy is tiptop except for a minute area (where the neck meets the soundboard), which is lighter in color because it missed an application of wood stain (not a big deal really)"}
{"source": " The guitalele has a satin (non-glossy) finish, which is a lot less prone to the unsightly scratches a high-gloss finish might incur"}
{"source": "The package includes a black nylon gig bag"}
{"source": "For a high quality instrument that costs a tiny fraction of the price for a full-size guitar, the Yamaha Guitalele GL-1 is a good buy (just under a Ninety as of this writing)"}
{"source": "This is one of the best pedals I have on my board"}
{"source": " I originally thought the reverb on my amp was fine enough but was enticed to try this"}
{"source": " I was very pleasantly surprised with the lovely quality of the reverb effect, which can be breathtaking"}
{"source": " The settings are all quite useful (Church, plate, spring, hall, room, gate etc) and then you can adjust the amount of the effect and the delay"}
{"source": " There is also a toneprint setting which is nice, but honestly, the pedal already has some many ways to adjust the sound, the toneprint seems redundant"}
{"source": " I leave this pedal on most of the time - along with my Corona chorus and Flashback delay"}
{"source": " It is part of &#34;my sound&#34;"}
{"source": "The best non-rackmount reverb I have ever had"}
{"source": "  So many options, clean, transparent, and whisper quiet"}
{"source": "  This is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain"}
{"source": "  The Toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb"}
{"source": "  Excellence once again from TC"}
{"source": "Well , at first i was looking for a reverb with a long and deep sound, like a grail or church, then i read about this tone print thing and i really like it, this give you a totally new range of sound based on a specific artist preset, so you can have a bunch of tone prints that you can download from the webpage, the only thing  that could be better is the instructions on how to download the tone prints it doesn't came with the instructions, although is really easy but at first i was blindfolded, but overall it is great"}
{"source": "This is the first and only TC Electronic product I've ever purchased"}
{"source": "  I watched the Youtube demos and liked what I heard"}
{"source": "  It has exceeded my expectations"}
{"source": " The reverb sounds are heavenly with plenty of control to tweak"}
{"source": " The Toneprint feature is amazing"}
{"source": "  I downloaded \"Church of Andy\" preset from the TCE website and just love that patch"}
{"source": "  Downloading is quick and easy"}
{"source": "  I created a folder on my computer and dowloaded all the available Hall of Fame patches so whenever I want to change it out, I don't even have to go on the Internet to get it"}
{"source": "  There is an iPhone/iPod4gen app where you can transfer the patches directly through you guitar to you pedal"}
{"source": " Don't ask me how it works, but it does"}
{"source": "  I will probably buy more TC Electronic pedals in the future"}
{"source": "I compared this side by side with two other reverbs-1) The Boss '63 Fender reverb2) The Electro Harmonix Holy Grail"}
{"source": "I found the EH- Holy Grail the most natural sounding and the simplest to operate with only 1 knob and one switch"}
{"source": "The TC pedal did sound nice, but to my ears slightly sterile by comparison to the Holy Grail"}
{"source": "I thought the Boss pedal sounded pretty bad"}
{"source": "Pros of the pedal:- several settings and with all the knobs, highly adjustable- mono or stero (2 inputs, 2 outputs)- standard 9 volt power supply jack used by most pedals- I liked the spring reverb, and the \"mod\" reverb which was lush"}
{"source": "Cons:- Sounded a little sterile compared to EH Holy Grail, but close and still good- I thought the number of different reverb settings was actually overkill and just there to look like it did a lot"}
{"source": " To my ears, the rest were less distinctive"}
{"source": "-Priced at $150, seemed a little high although I know there are other pedals that cost more"}
{"source": "Overall a nice pedal, I can't really ding it for the cons above so I still gave it 5 stars"}
{"source": " I had to compare a couple times to the EH holy grail to make my decision"}
{"source": " In the end, the grail was cheaper, simpler and sounded more like a real reverb tank in my opinion"}
{"source": "But it's a real step up from the effects on my Vox Mini 5 amp so I'm only going to complain too much"}
{"source": "  It actually cost more than the behringer amp I'm running it through which seems a little odd to me"}
{"source": "This is an absolutely amazing Reverb pedal"}
{"source": "  TC toneprint is very much a novelty, a very useful one at that if you want to dial in some really nice presets"}
{"source": " Where this pedal really shines is in it's endless ability to tweak the parameters using the downloadable editor"}
{"source": " You can spend hours finding &#34;Your Sound&#34; or just &#34;The Sound&#34; that you need"}
{"source": " High quality chassis, excellent switch and input/output jacks that give a satisfying thunk, indicating your cable is secured"}
{"source": "  Don't forget to lift the back panel to adjust the dipswitches to change the true bypass, tone dry through etc"}
{"source": " All and all a great one stop reverb pedal with tons of tone and potential that should last a lifetime"}
{"source": "I bought this unit because my amp doesn't have reverb"}
{"source": " But I discovered that this little pedal can give you greats sounds"}
{"source": " Even when I use a reverbed amp, I turn it off and use my Hall of Fame"}
{"source": "really you hate warm, sustaining, natural-tube overdrive; you won't like it at all"}
{"source": " This is my favorite OD pedal that I have"}
{"source": " I have compared it to the Vox ValveTone OD, the OD side of a EHX Germanium4 BMP, a EHX Linear Power Boost(my second favorite), an Ibanez TS5(90s model) and a Boss Fender Bassman FBM-1"}
{"source": " They all have their uses but I find the MojoMojo to be the most versatile, warm and punchy OD I have"}
{"source": " I pretty much use it as my base tone to push a lightly crunchy tube amp into overdrive"}
{"source": " This thing really wants to sing to you"}
{"source": " There are so many things going on in the mid to upper registers"}
{"source": " That's not to say it doesn't have some serious punchiness on the low end, which it does; so much that there is a voice switch that will cut the bass a little to keep it from getting too flubby on the neck pickups"}
{"source": " I pretty much leave that on all the time with humbuckers"}
{"source": " Single coils really benefit from the round lows this pedal dishes out and I am guessing that's why there is the voice switch"}
{"source": "The knobs/pots are nice and the bass/treble pots are notched at 12"}
{"source": " Turning to the left cuts and to the right boosts"}
{"source": " The drive goes from really clean and subtle, like a  mild boost, up to super drive territory"}
{"source": " I actually prefer the sound of this pedal to a Fulltone OCD, it just sounds a little more livelier to me"}
{"source": " I really like to push this pedal into the Fender Bassman pedal and get some seriously chimey bell-like highs with a medium crunch by setting it to a mild boost level and upping the gain on the FBM-1, as a third channel of sorts, and it sounds like a totally different amp stack"}
{"source": "Like I said, this has become the base of my tone now in just the short amount of time I have had it"}
{"source": " I was using the EHX Linear Boost to perform these duties before, and it performs well, but the soulful tone I get from the MojoMojo just adds the extra dimensionality that the pure boost doesn't"}
{"source": " I play mostly original compositions but I am going for the Jeff Beck tone and this helps me get where I want to go"}
{"source": "Of course none of this means I will stop buying OD pedals"}
{"source": " |o)"}
{"source": "There really is nothing not to like about this pedal"}
{"source": "a) 2 band eq plus voicing switch gives better tonal control than most,b) then drive goes from clean to solid overdrive"}
{"source": "c) level control provide from -ve to high +ve boost"}
{"source": "With drive set to 3pm and level at 2pm this gives a solid classic rock drive with a les paul and a blues junior"}
{"source": " really nice, roll back the gtr volume and it cleans to a crunch, roll back the drive and control from clean to crunch with the gtr volume"}

{"source": " Now for tone, this overdrive is a light overdrive and works really well for me when I'm leading worship n my band, we play heavier music, so I was messing around with this overdrive so I could use it there as well, and I discovered that if you try to use it as a boost pedal, it makes your tone really muddy, but if you send a dirty tone (overdrive or light distortion) into it, it screams beautifully"}
{"source": "Being a musician I wanted something easy to bring with me to catch the jams"}
{"source": "  With the support of this little recorder I have about 95% of what I have played over the last year available to me"}
{"source": "Sound Quality - there are many options to select from, sample rate, type (mp3, wav) and a number of other options"}
{"source": "  I have mainly recorded wav at 192, when I am done recording I normally will edit it in a DAW and then convert to mp3 for storage"}
{"source": "  I would say the audio is good, not great, but certainly right on for what I am doing considering the price"}
{"source": "  Power is about 4-6 hours of continuous recording"}
{"source": "  I can fit about 3 hours on high quality on the Gb card"}
{"source": "  This is usually a little more than I require when jamming"}
{"source": "  I have used the USB power when available and that has performed well"}
{"source": "I have been pleasantly surprised with the audio levels"}
{"source": "  Many times at a jam  you don't necessarily get to pick an appropriate vantage point to record everyone equally"}
{"source": "  Several times it had to sit next to the drummer, or on the stairs or on the window sill in one case, and I was worried about being able to pick up all the instruments, but on the default settings it seems to pick everyone up and not get saturated"}
{"source": "  One instrument may be louder than another but then I tweak it adding compression and eq as necessary to further enhance"}
{"source": "The only times it has failed has been I didn't have enough battery, I didn't format the card and it ran out of room or I forgot to press the record button TWICE before recording"}
{"source": "  The first arms the track, the second begins the recording"}
{"source": "  For the price I bought two and just keep one in my guitar case"}
{"source": "  I have not had reason to use the line in for the recorder, just the external mics"}
{"source": "allotoday went to the stores to TEST out the followingtascams"}
{"source": "dr 05,  dr 07 mk2, and dr 40  and, for myself,ended up buying nothing"}
{"source": "their differences for YOUR  ears"}
{"source": "are"}
{"source": "dr 05,  this is a good quality toy"}
{"source": "NO line in"}
{"source": "use its own mic, you will be ok  with this, for meetings, etc"}
{"source": "NOT really that good for  music"}
{"source": "can be done, but NOT as good"}

{"source": "u wont be happy either"}
{"source": "HIGH background HISS noise  relative to all 3"}
{"source": "dr 07etc etc"}
{"source": "only slightly better than 05"}
{"source": "all else same"}
{"source": "dr 40 was MUCH quieter in noise level"}
{"source": "be it"}
{"source": "in mic, ext mic or LINE inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars"}

{"source": "so, testing on their own mics"}
{"source": "that last one was far far better than the first two"}
{"source": "for those wantingLINE in"}
{"source": "means only that dr 40"}
{"source": "however,my tests involved  checking  sound QUALITY  of bit more seriousLIVE recordings"}
{"source": "took output from our  zoom r 24 recorder  and  input that to the dr 40"}

{"source": "my budget must be tripled at least"}
{"source": "and then to go out to test some more !no cheap way, is there"}
{"source": "for those curious, the whole idea has come from wanting to connect  2 units of zoom r24,  NOT wanting to use computer software,  taking the 4 outputs from these two into a clean mixer or analog sum box,  and getting them downto  2 channels, and finallly to some mastering digital recorder"}
{"source": "hoping perhaps the tascam ss r100 or r200 MIGHT do the trick,in the tests to come"}
{"source": "many thanks, and may your camels always have two humps !k"}
{"source": "Until 5-6 years ago there was a virtual void in high-quality personal digital recorders"}
{"source": "  Then the Zoom H2 came along, and numerous variations on a theme were soon to follow"}
{"source": "  I've owned both the H2 and the H1 and, though both have their strong points, the Tascam DR-05 has served me better than either"}
{"source": " The H2 has pleasing 4-point sound and the H1, at half the size of the Tascam, works well for \"stealth\" as well as video recordings when mounted on a camera"}
{"source": "  But both recorders are more complicated than necessary, with tricky menu systems, excessive tiny buttons (6 on one thin side of the H1), and dicey build quality"}
{"source": "The Tascam addresses these shortcomings with a machine that's a pleasure to use"}
{"source": "  There are no shaky, rattling parts, the controls are solid and instantly solved (easily manageable with a single thumb), and the wide-spread mic pattern is ideal for most stereo recordings of music (for dictation, I use a separate, small mic inserted in the topside input)"}
{"source": "  The machine reminds me of the far costlier Sony PCM-50 in terms of ease and convenience of operation"}
{"source": " The Tascam's 320 kbps MP3 recordings of a grand piano strike my ears as no less authentic and sonically \"present\" than its 96/24 WAV files, and tweaking is held to the absolute minimum"}
{"source": "  If you don't have $500 to spend and are looking for a woodshedding companion for day-in, day-out use, this is the one"}
{"source": "I got this to compliment my filming of events, concerts etc"}
{"source": " After my first test recording, when I played back the audio using the built-in speaker I really thought that I had been duped into believing this device was 'studio quality' "}
{"source": "Then I listened to that same test recording using headphones, and WOW!! This has got to be heard to be believed! There are so many applications for this recorder; it's ease of operation and quick start-up time make it ideal for hurried set-ups"}
{"source": "i had a dr-07 that i loved but it mysteriously walked out during a gig we played at a local bar"}
{"source": "  i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less"}
{"source": "  i never used the reverb or overdubbing capabilities of the dr 07 anyway and i usually used it with the mics folded in"}
{"source": "  i have recorded several rehearsals with this one and i cant tell a difference between the recordings i made with the dr 07 and the recordings from this one"}
{"source": "  this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals"}
{"source": "I purchased mine to protect a relatively inexpensive Epiphone Les Paul Jr, which fits perfectly (as does a Squier Strat"}
{"source": ")On the plus side, the price makes this an attractive alternative to most of the soft gig bags on the market because you are getting a rigid case that can take some (but not a lot) of abuse"}
{"source": "The reason I claimed that this case will provide only basic protection is it does not have the top and side strength to protect an instrument if you stack heavy equipment on the case when packing your gear"}
{"source": " That should not be a problem or detract from the value as long as you are aware of this"}
{"source": " One other issue I've had with the case is I left in a car on a hot day the tolex covering started lifting from the edges, especially the lip around the top of the case"}
{"source": " Again, this is not a problem as long as you are aware of it and do not leave the case in a hot, enclosed space for prolonged periods"}
{"source": "For inexpensive guitars this is an ideal case that will provide protection for your instrument"}
{"source": " It is perfect for occasional gigging, but would probably not withstand the rigors of being on the road"}
{"source": " I would not hesitate to purchase another one if I acquired a guitar with a soft gig bag because I do like the better protection this particular case provides"}
{"source": "I ordered one of these (from MF) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work"}
{"source": "  Even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case"}
{"source": "  But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing"}
{"source": "  As for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed"}
{"source": "  The other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut"}
{"source": "Disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case"}
{"source": "  The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag"}
{"source": "  It also won't stand evenly on end (if that's important to you)"}
{"source": "On the positive side it's light, it does fit a Telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment"}
{"source": "  But do yourself a favor and spend another $25 and get something better"}
{"source": "  I have a Musician's Gear dreadnought case and this doesn't compare to that one at all"}
{"source": "Like many here the case could be an inch bigger"}
{"source": "  For my Ibanez 510  I cut the bottom material along the edge against the side wall enough to take out the bottom foam and then put the material back"}
{"source": "  Now mine closes without pressure on the bridge"}
{"source": "We have my grandpa's really old Mandolin now, so my dad and I wanted a nice case for our 70 year old mandolin"}
{"source": " I saw this case and thought that maybe it would work"}
{"source": " Well it works just fine, the mandolin is a little bit more deep than the case but it still works and closes well"}
{"source": "Now the mandolin is in this case and hopefully will keep lasting in there!"}
{"source": "It's a good quality case"}
{"source": " I wouldn't check it as luggage when flying, but it's small so bring it as a carry-on"}
{"source": " It'll protect your mando just fine"}
{"source": "I bought this guitar case for wife, as she plays a acoustic guitar and needed to replace her &#34;GIG bag( soft case) with a hard case that would protect her guitar better than the soft case could"}
{"source": " She absolutely loves the case and it is well built and when you use it, it makes you think that this case should cost more, but for the $60, it is an awesome deal"}
{"source": "The case fits her acoustic like a glove and has a storage compartment for her Mic cable, DI box , picks and tuner"}
{"source": " Underneath the neck, there is enough space for storage of two sets of extra guitar strings"}
{"source": " You  might pay more for a NAME brand case"}
{"source": "save some money for soemthing else an dget this case, because it is a great deal"}
{"source": " We found nothing negative that we could say about it"}
{"source": " It also was packaged VERY well to protect the case during shipment and came very quick"}
{"source": "I honestly don't know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too"}
{"source": " I've seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more"}
{"source": " This is a hard shell tolex covered case"}
{"source": " They are sturdy, well padded with plush black lining, and look as good as cases costing much more"}
{"source": " These cases are made for dreadnought guitars, and I bought two of them"}
{"source": " One is for my Ibanez AK75G arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly"}
{"source": " The case has 4 brass latches and one is lockable and comes with 2 keys"}
{"source": " It's made in China, but isn't most everything these days? I wouldn't recommend it for airline/railroad baggage, but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions"}
{"source": " I don't think you'll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else"}
{"source": " Don't be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better"}
{"source": " Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases!"}
{"source": "I bought this recently for $40 to replace the old cardboard case my acoustic had been in for decades"}
{"source": "  For $40 it's an awesome deal"}
{"source": "  But objectively, when compared to an Epiphone 335-style case I bought last year for $81, it's deserving of 4 stars (which isn't bad, just not great):PROS:  Decent build quality; four buckles (one locking) and three hinges; very nice plush lining; not heavy; knobs on bottom so it stands on end; knobs on side and back so it's never directly on the floor; fits a dreadnaught well"}
{"source": "CONS:  Not easy to close and takes some work to get all the buckles lined up and snapped shut; the one locking buckle wouldn't stop anyone; the big front and back body panels flex more than they should; exterior covering feels somewhat cheap; the handle is hard plastic and not padded"}
{"source": "So for $40 it's a great deal and a big step up from unlined cardboard, but it doesn't measure up to a basic Epi 335 case which is stronger and has better hardware and finishes"}
{"source": "  It also had a strong chemical odor, but leave it open to air out for a while and that mostly goes away"}
{"source": "It fits well, close well, protects well, transport well! What more can I ask from a guitar case that cost a fraction of the other cases"}
{"source": "  Have not have it that long to rate the durability but I like this case"}
{"source": "All guitarists know that there are 1 billion strat copies out there"}
{"source": " They vary a bit, but basically you have a light, 3 pickup, versitale guitar that does that job - that is about it"}
{"source": " But this Legacy, which I can see as I am typing, is much more"}
{"source": "First, the natural finish is what got me started"}
{"source": " It seems that a natural finish is about as rare as a news web site without video ads"}
{"source": " I looked at $700+ Fenders, but except for the natural finish - what was I getting for $700? I wanted a strat copy that I could customize - this is IT!"}
{"source": " I am putting split hot rail-type pickups in this, and WOW I have a strat, 3-pickup LP, and anything in between"}
{"source": "Get one!"}
{"source": "1"}

{"source": " Prepare $1000 for a tube amp and a good guitar with brand name pickups for upgrade"}

{"source": "Speak from experience, I've tried a lot and did many research"}
{"source": " This guitar with amplug just sound amazing! Plus, it can be your forever play around set which you will be happy with and bring them out"}
{"source": " Guitars and amps below $400, yes there are good stuff, but you're more likely to get problematic things that will be replace by better things latter"}
{"source": " For a budget around $1000, if you don't go professional, you will be happy with them forever"}
{"source": " So do yourself a favor, one shot, no waste of time and money"}
{"source": "This guitar is good enough for any beginners"}
{"source": " Most under $400 guitars don't have good pickups, so why spend extra money? (Again, my bloody experience taught me that"}
{"source": "I've spent time and money, way more than $1000) Free advice"}
{"source": "I strongly recommend this guitar, it has no fault towards its price"}
{"source": "I figured I'd buy a cheap second guitar, so I found this one"}
{"source": " One of the cheapest prices on Amazon"}
{"source": " And I thought wow, what a great look this guitar has"}
{"source": " I was also hoping that it played well"}
{"source": " Well I've been playing it for a while and it still sounds pretty good, and I've had no technical issues what so ever"}
{"source": " I would recommend to ANYONE"}
{"source": " Keep up the good work! =)"}
{"source": "This is a great starter guitar its cheap and high quality i myself already play the guitar and couldnt pass up buying such a good guitar at a rock bottom price this guitar to sum it up is like a generic version of a squire by fender and if this guitar was a more well known company the guitar could easily sell for 300$ bottom line great guitar all around for beginners and thrashers"}
{"source": "This Is one great piece"}
{"source": " The quality of the guitar is Amazing!!! and for Its price Outstanding!! It plays Beautifully with my 100w amp"}
{"source": " And with my experience of guitars, this is a go getter, otherwise I would see this one stand out to a $300 Les Paul!!!"}
{"source": "I don't know if 39\" (from the top of the headstock to the bottom of the body {I know guitars are based on the size of the frets but no idea how to do that} ) is the normal size for an adult"}
{"source": "However for $50 (its on sale at the time) even if its not I can still learn to play since thats why I bought it is to learn"}
{"source": "The pick guard had some sort of plastic cover that was rough but doesn't really affect anything, since it seems like something was put on it to help shipping once removed the pick guard is fine"}
{"source": "All togther whether its a full size adult or just one for kids its still pretty good"}
{"source": "I am happy with it"}
{"source": "Good clean sound, at least with my headphone amp (only amp I have)"}
{"source": "Comes with Whammy bar(thats what I know it as), one volume, two tone, the pickup sector switch, the cord that connects your guitar to your amp"}
{"source": "**EDIT**So now that Amazon has grouped the guitar with many others (mostly the color differences) and that I have a little bit more knowlage of the guitar, not saying much really but a little bit, I have found that mine has two dead spots on the volume"}
{"source": " Not much of an issue, for me at least but worth mentioning"}
{"source": "This unit works as advertised"}
{"source": "  I've used it to record my garage band shows"}
{"source": "  Making a simple recording and transferring it to a computer for storage and playback is easy to accomplish for a novice"}
{"source": "  Buyers should bear in mind that the unit records ambient sounds (e"}
{"source": "g"}

{"source": "If your a musician (or want to be?) recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well"}
{"source": " I have found recording to be extremely important to my ability to learn new songs and that having been said, you cannot beat a Tascam recorder for ease of operation, features and sound quality"}
{"source": " Enough said, buy a Tascam if you serious about your music"}
{"source": "The use of the device was moderately difficult"}
{"source": "  The primary difficulty was in the how the user's manual was written"}
{"source": "  The information is not straight forth, and the \"how to\" especially on setting up the device was severely lacking"}
{"source": "  This left me to the old plug and chug method"}
{"source": "  Once I figured out how to set it up"}
{"source": "I found the sound quality weak and tinny out of the onboard speaker"}
{"source": "  The DR did sound better with ear buds, but still was short of what I expected based on the reviews on Amazon and other websites"}
{"source": "  The good things though is that it is light, portable and the mics can be moved"}
{"source": "  I wasn't expecting bose type of sound, but I wasn't expecting to hear the tin man either"}
{"source": "I waited a few weeks to get used to the recorder before reviewing it, I didnt want to be like some of the other reviewers who gave a first impression review based of their lack of understanding"}
{"source": "It works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas"}
{"source": "$12 16GB Sandisc cards work great as long as you understand it only records up to 2gb at a time, but the Tascam will jump to next 2gb if it runs over only causing a few second skip"}

{"source": "get it"}
{"source": "I paid $110 shipped for mine, so look on Amazon or Ebay for purchase"}
{"source": "the big music stores always mark up the prices very HIGH"}
{"source": "zzounds, musicians friend sweetwater music 123, dont buy from them"}
{"source": "Jim"}
{"source": "Just use a smartphone to record stuff"}
{"source": " This is a really weird, not very intuitive little device that has been antiquated by the iphone and other smart phones"}
{"source": " Not really worth the $75 - I returned mine"}
{"source": "I purchased this product a few weeks ago after reviewing and \"kicking\" the tires of this one and it's competition"}
{"source": "  I will tell you up front my decision to buy the DR-07MKII over the Zoom H1 came down to the inclusion of a guitar tuner and the ability to be a phrase trainer!  I'm a musician and a wanna-be videographer, since the quality of captured sound was the same on each test I read about (DR-07MKII vs Zoom H1) and listened too on YouTube I decided the tuner would keep my gig bag the same size"}
{"source": "Most reviews never touched on the phrase trainer feature targeted at musicians"}
{"source": "  Tascam makes a line of phrase trainers that typically cost between $150-200 and don't even have high quality microphones, so discovering I could toss an MP3 of the song I was learning and slow it down to figure out the chords and lead guitar parts was an unexpected surprise"}
{"source": " This is the better choice for musicians"}
{"source": "Other features I appreciate about the DR-07MKII, the adjustable microphones, quick turn on and being armed to record, the file system, the low battery consumption"}
{"source": "I should also mention that straight out of the box i attempted to record, after all, everyone said how easy it was to simply open it up, power it up and start recording"}
{"source": "  Well, I got a recording without sound!  The unit comes from the factory with the record level at zero"}
{"source": "  Once I figure that out all was right again in my universe"}
{"source": "  You will want to start with a recording level that is high and adjust lower to suite your recording situation"}
{"source": "  I found out the hard way how much of a waste of time it was to start low first, a few of my early attempts at recording our church worship team practice was disappointing"}
{"source": "  The more aggressive recording level solved that problem"}
{"source": "I purchased a standard microphone windscreen for it, after the first time or two of stretching it on with some difficulty the windscreen loosened up enough to make it a simple process"}
{"source": "  I have tried recording outside with this unit and the windscreen with good results"}
{"source": " I still don't know how I will solve the  wind noise issue when recording ambient sound (microphone capsules facing out) since the windscreen will only cover the microphones in the XY pattern position"}
{"source": "  I'm sure someone makes the smaller windscreen though"}
{"source": "For my video work I use inexpensive hd capable camcorders"}
{"source": " My new fascination is with the Song Bloggie (swivel camera lense), they are inexpensive now ($50 on Craigslist these days) and with the DR-07MKII all my video pieces have wonderful sound to go along with the surprisingly good picture quality I get from the Bloggie"}
{"source": "One last detail, at the point of purchase I discovered Amazon was doing a special on my purchase and discounted the DR-07MKII to the same price point as the Zoom H1"}
{"source": " win win!  I got what I expected with my purchase, you will too"}
{"source": "This is probably obvious to more experienced musicians, but for Amateur musicians (like me), If you think that you know how your audience hears you because you listen through your monitor while you play, then you're fooling yourself"}
{"source": "  You have to listen to your mix by recording it, then listening while you're not playing/singing"}
{"source": "I could never see myself buying a dedicated compressor, reverb pedal, harmonizer, ring modulator, etc"}
{"source": "  The Line 6 M5 seemed like a good way to have a \"jack-of-all-trades\" pedal on my board for those times I needed one specialized effect"}
{"source": "  I have to say that it serves that purpose in spades"}
{"source": "I have an all-analog board and was reluctant to have anything digital on it based on past experience with modelers"}
{"source": "  I was wrong to worry; digital has come a long way"}
{"source": "  Almost all of the effects sound great to my ear, especially into a tube amp"}
{"source": "  True bypass means no tone suck to boot"}
{"source": "High points for the delays, reverbs, and mods"}
{"source": "  I am not a fan of all of the drives but the Overdrive and Boost Comp sound pretty awesome"}
{"source": "  The Rat model \"Classic Distortion\" sounds exactly like my ProCo Rat2"}
{"source": "  Wish I could say the same for the Big Muff model but I guess they couldn't get them all right"}
{"source": "The only issue is I liked it so much I could not resist the urge to get the M9 so I can run three effects simultaneously"}
{"source": "  However, if you need a pedal to fill in for those times when you need a certain single effect the M5 is a winner"}
{"source": "I was dissapointed to find out that you can only use one of theeffects at a time, good though they were"}
{"source": " Too expensive foronly one effect at a time"}
{"source": " Returned it"}
{"source": "This single pedal unit has a lot of  amazing and suprising effects"}
{"source": " A lot of overdrive/distortions, filters, modulations, delays, reverbs, all carefully modeled"}
{"source": " I put M5 side-by-side with the &#34;real one&#34; with a A/B switch, and don't heard differences"}
{"source": " I'm using in musics where I need programed delays (like U2 or Pink Floyd) or when I need a specific effect - I only use Tremolo in 1 music, and this gear help me to save my money"}
{"source": "When I bought this pedal I was thinking a heavy distortion"}
{"source": " But when I got it and played with it I figured out it was alot different that advertised"}
{"source": " It is a acdc, Steve Vaughn kind of pedal"}
{"source": " It's got an attitude but it soft at the same time"}
{"source": " It's truly a one of a kind product"}
{"source": " I would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal"}
{"source": " Make a note it is not a metal pedal"}
{"source": " Not by any means actually"}
{"source": " But for what it is it is fantastic"}
{"source": "I usually stickup to the OverDrive pedals, asking tons of sound from tubes and extra overdrives"}
{"source": " Still, I needed a Distortion that could cover of the Marshall sound-like roar JCM-800"}
{"source": " and this guy did the job! It's not a Riot, but"}
{"source": " pretty much defends its self from the old 70-80s songs"}
{"source": " Love it!"}
{"source": "I bought this pedal wanting classic distortion and find it more useful as an overdrive pedal"}
{"source": " The distortion range does not get as hot as a RAT or MXR classic distortion but it sounds great with a telecaster and tube amp"}
{"source": " I use it with a cigar box guitar also for fun and the tone ranges from 60's and 70's distortion to 80's metal"}
{"source": " I get a more extreme distortion from my old hissing Boss Mega Distion as an example"}
{"source": "I like that the pedal has a wide array of uses"}
{"source": " The build quality seems questionable from MXR"}
{"source": " As others have posted, the box is very light and the knobs seem thinner than other MXR's, espeacially the older ones, but this pedal seems solid and makes no noise"}
{"source": "The price and demo videos were the primary reason I bought this pedal and I am happy with it"}
{"source": " I have many distortion pedals and each one is useful in their own way"}
{"source": " I would steer clear of this if you are looking for a pedal for metal and definately buy it if you are into classic rock, twang, and blues"}
{"source": "Well"}
{"source": " it's not really too expensive, but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it"}
{"source": "  Even the crunch button is just a louder sound?  Not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for"}
{"source": "  Guess that's why it's so cheap"}
{"source": "Wanted to review this pedal because I felt some of the other reviews were a little lukewarm"}
{"source": "  Distortion is incredibly subjective-it depends on your rig and your tastes"}
{"source": " But the Badass '78 by MXR is a very nice pedal for a decent price"}
{"source": "  It doesn't do metal or super high-gain, but offers some nice classic rock tones and can be quite warm if you back off on the tone knob"}
{"source": " The crunch button adds brightness and volume and may or may not be too harsh for your setup"}
{"source": "  However, the tone knob does do a pretty good job of rolling back the high end, especially if you activate the \"crunch\" button"}
{"source": "The build quality seems to be pretty good, though I should note that while the pedal is the same size as other MXR pedals, it is significantly lighter"}
{"source": "  I suppose this could make it more susceptible to denting and damage if it travels, but it should be plenty durable for 95% of users"}
{"source": "  I really like the switch on this one too, it's easy to press and clearly clicks \"on\" once depressed"}
{"source": "  One minor annoyance if you use the \"crunch\" setting is that the blue light (which is annoyingly bright like an LED headlight) stays on EVEN when the pedal itself is off"}
{"source": "  This can be quite distracting if you rely on the lights on your pedal board to tell you which effects are on"}
{"source": "  Not really a major gripe that detracts from the pedal's quality, but a frustrating design decision"}
{"source": "Basically, if you get the right setup, you'll get great tone"}
{"source": "  I got this pedal specifically to try and find a better alternative to the BOSS DS-1, which lacks mids and can sound harsh/abrasive"}
{"source": "  The MXR '78 Badass is definitely superior in that regard, but a lot will depend on your rig and settings"}
{"source": "  I find that this pedal really excels on playing single notes on the lower strings (think \"Walk this Way\" by Aerosmith, or \"Hangingaround\" intro by Counting Crows)"}
{"source": "  And if you pair it with a fat tubescreamer or other overdrive pedal, you could probably thicken it up a bit for higher solos"}
{"source": "  Great pedal!"}
{"source": "This pedal gives me a whole range of tremolo to choose from"}
{"source": " From subtle warm tones to psychedelic waves of volume all for only $40! And it's built tough like a good effects pedal should be: full metal case and solid construction, an all around great buy"}
{"source": "This product is bad quality because the noise it makes"}
{"source": " It increases the volume so much that it is better not to use it at all"}
{"source": " I'm going to sell this product"}
{"source": " I didn't like it"}
{"source": "For most guitarists, tremolo is a very simple effect"}
{"source": "  You simply want a pedal to control swells or oscillations in volume to give your tone a \"shimmering\" effect"}
{"source": "  It's used in subtle fashion in everything from to 50's/60's rock and surf guitar to modern \"indie\" rock"}
{"source": "  But most guitarists (like me) were never going to shell out $100 (or more) for a Boss or other expensive tremolo option"}
{"source": "  In fact, there really weren't that many affordable tremolo pedals on the market"}
{"source": "Enter the Joyo JF-09 Tremolo"}
{"source": "  This pedal is simple, durable, affordable ($40 - $45), and it just works"}
{"source": "  The only two controls are for Intensity (depth of the volume swells) and Rate (how fast the swells cycle)"}
{"source": "  The LED light dims rhythmically along with the \"Rate\" control, which is a nice visual indicator"}
{"source": "As for the sound - the pedal sounds great"}
{"source": "  It doesn't color or diminish your tone in any way"}
{"source": "  I'm not a \"tremolo expert\", but the effect sounds as it should"}
{"source": "  If you're the type to obsess over tremolo, then you probably aren't looking to save money anyway, and there are $200 boutique options from Catalinbread and others that have tap input and other features"}
{"source": "  I'm not particularly interested in those, so the lack of those on the Joyo won't detract from my score"}
{"source": "Regarding the quality and durability of Joyo pedals, there's a lot of discussion about that, but also some misinformation"}
{"source": "  I've personally owned 7 of them at one point or another (yes, I like them that much), and I've yet to have one fail"}
{"source": "  The early run of Joyo pedals is actually quite durable, and includes the JF-09 Tremolo and every pedal numbered from JF-01 through JF-17"}
{"source": "  The more recent models numbered higher than that are all similar in appearance, and while many of them still sound great, they feel lighter, \"cheaper\", and the switch is a little more suspect"}
{"source": "  I recommend ordering through a vendor that ships from the U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": ", rather than trying to save a few bucks on a direct shipment from China"}
{"source": "  Many of the U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": " vendors will test the pedal out before shipping it, which is a huge advantage"}
{"source": "Highly recommended!"}
{"source": "DOWNGRADE TO 1-O STAR AFTER RETURNING IT BACK TO BROOKMAYS, THE SELLER:I am really disappointed by the seller, BrookMays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective Cherbub Guitar Pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue"}
{"source": "  After two weeks of the returned item was delivered, I didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap"}
{"source": "  Too bad, four days after the email had been sent, I only got the email of telling me the case# of the message I sent without any further response to my refund"}
{"source": "  until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and I don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs"}
{"source": " Therefore, yesterday, I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still haven't heard from the seller shorty"}
{"source": "Today, I finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, \"it was not defective"}
{"source": " All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar"}
{"source": " The feedback can be to to many other issues"}
{"source": " I have issued the refund of $7"}
{"source": "04"}
{"source": "\"  Obviously, the reply is unconvincing; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues, i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups, but it doesn't have such problems at all"}
{"source": "  The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didn't try many pickups"}
{"source": "  Cherub Guitar Pickup doesn't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises"}
{"source": "  Moreover, the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying, and there's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming"}
{"source": " Indeed, I won't use it, and I don't want it to sit at my house as a useless property, so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has"}
{"source": "  However, the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it's NOT worth at all"}
{"source": "By the way, I'm also unhappy about the refund of &7"}
{"source": "04, I bought it for $8"}
{"source": "79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $25 or more"}
{"source": "  To me, it is not the money of $1"}
{"source": "75, but it's not fair to the buyer, who doesn't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter"}
{"source": " So if you really need a pickup for your instrument, I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one"}
{"source": " Don't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price, in turn, you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise"}
{"source": "  I don't want that happens to anyone else, so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it"}
{"source": "2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE:I like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings"}
{"source": "  Besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description \"regardless the surrounding noises"}
{"source": "\"  I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises"}
{"source": "  One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use, and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback"}
{"source": " However, when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke"}
{"source": " the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either"}
{"source": "  I don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got "}
{"source": " I bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, I can't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller"}
{"source": " So, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, BrookMays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description"}
{"source": " Good Luck then!"}
{"source": "I bought this for the other half of my duet to use on there guitar and mandolin "}
{"source": "They had there doubts about how good it would sound and if it would feedback"}
{"source": "Well surprise surprise surprise it didn't feedback and it sounds great"}
{"source": "I would recommend this product"}
{"source": "I have a couple of clip on mics that I tried out"}
{"source": "  This one is definitely the best"}
{"source": "  I use it on the head stock of my soprano ukes and right in the sound hole for my bari uke"}
{"source": "  You do have to find the sweet spot, but once you do, it works great through my Pignose amp, and actually fits right inside my Pignose"}
{"source": "  Great value and price too!"}
{"source": "Very good for any instrument that does not have a pick up on it!!!!!! I would recommend this product to a friend!"}
{"source": "I really like the Cherub pickup"}
{"source": " It is the easiest to install in my classical guitar of any pickup I've used"}
{"source": " The sound quality is very good for a piezo pickup and better than at least one of the more complicated bar type in the sound hole type pickups I have"}
{"source": " The pick wire out to the amp is skinny and only 8 feet long, but for 8 bucks it can't be beat"}
{"source": "I recently purchased a Vox Mini3 G2 modeling amp to go with my new Mainland Tenor (acoustic/electric) ukulele"}
{"source": " It was my first electric instrument and I immediately fell in love with the combination uke/amp"}
{"source": "A little time went by and I began wishing I could plug my 5 other non-electric ukuleles and 3 guitars into my amp"}
{"source": "  I see DIY pickup sets are pretty inexpensive, but I didn't really want the expense (times eight) or the hassle of drilling holes and installing them on all those instruments"}
{"source": "Then I stumbled on this Cherub pickup"}
{"source": "  For about the cost of lunch at McDonalds it seemed I might &#34;electrify&#34; on the fly whatever instrument I cared to "}
{"source": " "}

{"source": " pickup"}
{"source": "  So I bought it"}
{"source": "Bottom line is that it works very well for my needs"}
{"source": "  And although I don't have a very critical ear, I (think) I can hear a slight quality/clarity difference between the built-in pickup on my Mainland uke vs clipping this onto my other instruments, but that's not a surprise and such a small difference that I don't much care"}
{"source": " So far I've been clipping it into the sound holes, but I might try it on the headstock as others have recommended"}
{"source": "If you're a Rock-God don't even consider this (why would you anyway?)"}
{"source": " But if you're a mere mortal just having some fun with your instruments and would like an inexpensive option to plug one in once in a while, this Cherub is for you"}
{"source": "This is more of a toy than a good pickup"}
{"source": " It functions but doesn't sound great"}
{"source": " What did I want for this price anyway?"}
{"source": "This is a cool gadget"}
{"source": "  I love experimenting with adjusting the power level on various pedals"}
{"source": "  It can do some strange things and get unique sounds"}
{"source": "You know the problem with 9v wall warts is that noise in the signal can be a problem"}
{"source": "  I am powering my 9 unit pedal board with this adapter and it works great"}
{"source": "  I have used it some at lower voltages, but only on my older analog pedals"}
{"source": "  I wouldn't reccomend running digital effects at reduced voltage"}
{"source": "  The cord is a little wimpy compared to my Boss PSA adapter, but it is acceptable"}
{"source": "This power supply is advertised as having the capability to power multiple pedals"}
{"source": " That's good to know, but since I plan on using it to power only one pedal, it works fine for me"}
{"source": " The variable voltage settings give you some interesting effects"}
{"source": " I am very pleased with it and recommend it over other brands"}
{"source": "The Danelectrode has a knob that allows you to set how much volts you want to feed your pedals with (3V to 9V), by giving less power to them, you can get some really spooky sounds; great fun, but can also help give you your characteristic sound"}
{"source": "  I also like the fact that you connect it vertically on the outlet, this allows to connect any other stuff to the same outlet because it does not take all the space on it, like other adapters do"}
{"source": "  The price is great, I'm planning to have several of this"}
{"source": "I like the Dan Electrode but I noticed dropping the voltage on some of my pedals really changes the effect (turned my Heavy Metal into a sick fuzz and my LavaBox  into a primitive distortion), and on others dropping voltage can mean a slight loss of sustain(Onerr Overdrive) or volume(FrenchToast) and thats it"}
{"source": " It's still a good 9volt power supply but the voltage drop feature doesn't always 'wow' you"}
{"source": "This may have been the best money I've ever spent for a guitar accessory"}
{"source": " I can dial the pressure to exactly what I need for any spot on the neck"}
{"source": " It has a smooth action, no \"kerchunk\" noise"}
{"source": " My guitar stays in tune when capo-ed"}
{"source": " I love it!"}
{"source": "Well made Capo"}
{"source": " Works as designed on my acoustic"}
{"source": " Easy to usel and it is nice that you can adjust the pressure on the strings"}
{"source": " Just wish it had a spring so It could stay attached to the head of the guitar when not in use"}
{"source": " I am always setting it down and forgetting where I left it"}
{"source": "I started playing and writing a few songs that were specifically designed to get the sound that comes from a capo higher on the neck"}
{"source": "I found that I needed to have a couple of exta capos hanging around and so bought this and the G7th"}
{"source": " Both are very good"}
{"source": " I did notice that if I had a wider neck (I think i am 42"}
{"source": "5 mm at the nut on my two Takamines) the may be a bit short"}
{"source": " They work and are cool looking"}
{"source": " I have aa adjustable Planet Waves that also works great"}
{"source": " Cheaper ones also work"}
{"source": "Simple"}
{"source": " Effective"}
{"source": "  Just what I wanted"}
{"source": "  Seems a tad flimsy, but, time will tell"}
{"source": "  Tuning couldn't be easier"}
{"source": "  Neat product"}
{"source": "It's not that great"}
{"source": " You go through batteries like crazy and it doesn't work at all for bass"}
{"source": " It's fine for guitar or banjo"}
{"source": "Easy and quite simple to use, this tuner is accurate and none intrusive, so you can leave it on your instrument for a quick re-tune on the go"}
{"source": "Works amazingly well, is very precise, and easy to handle"}
{"source": " I have seen other devices that would get confused about frequencies and jump back and forth between different notes"}
{"source": " Not so this one"}
{"source": " It is a great, reliable tuner"}
{"source": "Does what it was intended to do"}
{"source": " Completely satisfied with this purchase"}
{"source": " Seems to work just fine for my needs"}
{"source": "The one that shipped was the cheaper, shiny plastic one"}
{"source": "  In my experience this model is inferior"}
{"source": "  Also the rubber lining inside the clip was unattached - probably the glue didn't hold?  I like Snarks and think they are some of the best clip-on tuners"}
{"source": "  Just not a fan of the cheap, shiny plastic versions"}
{"source": "  I'll try returning it and getting the SN-8"}
{"source": "Got this to tune my guitar without relying on Rocksmith on my PS3, and to double check against it"}
{"source": " I have a pretty crappy ear, so I rely on it to tune correctly"}
{"source": " Responds fast, display is INCREDIBLE! I wish my car dash looked like this thing"}
{"source": " Fits easily on the headstock of the guitar, in front or behind"}
{"source": " Tunes by sensing the vibration of the instrument, not using a microphone, so you can tune even if it is noisy"}
{"source": " And any pedals, effects, amps, etc in the setup do not affect the tone, you are tuning the actual resonance of the string"}
{"source": " Even picks up well enough for me to adjust intonation as well"}
{"source": " Forced a friend who just bought a bass to get one too"}
{"source": " For the price, I would recommend anyone who plays a stringed instrument get one"}
{"source": "Really, they are"}
{"source": " I really don't have anything more to say about it"}
{"source": " I've played for 13 years and these are by far my favorite tuners ever"}
{"source": " Affordable, accurate, and they don't fall off your knee all the time lol!"}
{"source": "This little Snark is easy to carry around and works great"}
{"source": "  I have used several different styles and brands, this is a must have for musicians"}
{"source": "Great little tooland very handy, a bargain and a good buy Does not mar my guitar and is easy to see,Thanks"}
{"source": "-  This tuner is affordable and it works well"}
{"source": " I have purchased six so far"}
{"source": " They are sturdy"}
{"source": " They have all come with a battery in the box you have to install yourself"}
{"source": "-  I actually sat on one and thought I broke it, turned out the main tuner head pops right back on to the goose neck"}
{"source": " The LED is bright in low light but does not display well in bright daylight"}
{"source": " If the display starts to dim in the dark you need a new battery"}
{"source": " The fairly large disk style battery cost me $9"}
{"source": "80 for a two/pack at  Walgreens"}
{"source": "-  We had a Birthday Jam at a friends house"}
{"source": " I used this tuner for my guitar and ending up passing it around all night between three bass players and four guitarists"}
{"source": " At the end of the night I gave it to the birthday boy as he had admired it all night"}
{"source": "-  I gave one to my grand-nephews"}
{"source": " I keep one on each my favorite acoustic and electric guitars"}
{"source": " They stay on in their cases"}
{"source": " I like the goose neck style but I have not tried the other no-neck swivel ones"}
{"source": " I also have one for my Bass"}
{"source": " It's a great musician's party favor"}
{"source": "-  I always had trouble reading my old analog tuners in low light so I really like these tuners"}
{"source": " Don't forget - Practice, Practice, Practice"}
{"source": "Snark tuners are the best"}
{"source": "  A few months ago I bought a different brand tuner and it doesn't pick up all strings"}
{"source": "  I bought this one and it works great"}
{"source": "  No problems"}
{"source": "Snark tuners are great"}
{"source": " Since I've bought Snark tuners, they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way"}
{"source": " I've had some for years that I still use today without ever changing batteries or anything"}
{"source": " They are great and last forever"}
{"source": " This one is also super accurate and allows you to really fine-tune your instrument"}
{"source": " It have a vibration and mic sensor, so it can be attached to the instrument or set aside played in to to get a reading on the pitch that is being played"}
{"source": " Really nice piece of equipment for a small price"}
{"source": "I tried one of these on my violin at a Guitar Center where it's costs more than Amazon"}
{"source": "I think the Amazon price is the best you'll find"}
{"source": "It works as well as expensive tuners"}
{"source": " In addition to tuning up the strings, I use it to practice scales on the violin and check my intonation"}
{"source": "Be advised though, that it only registers natural notes and sharps"}
{"source": " It does not show a readout of flat notes, instead it shows the &#34;equivalent&#34; note"}
{"source": " But as violin players know, a B flat is NOT the same as an A#"}
{"source": "But it doesn't just read the letter of the note your on"}
{"source": " The graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it"}
{"source": "For ten bucks, you can't go wrong"}
{"source": "This will b my 2nd one of these so to me it's worth it"}
{"source": " The 1st one I loaned to a friend and never got back so for $10 I just got another"}
{"source": " I think their pretty accurate"}
{"source": " I normally tune by ear but if there's a few of us playing then sometimes someone needs one, and I always use it putting on new strings myself"}
{"source": " As far as battery life goes you can get them right on Amazon"}
{"source": " They are cheap you can get a package of 6, each one lasting over a year or if you prefer you can go over to Walmart and get them in the jewelery section"}
{"source": "I'm pretty impressed with it"}
{"source": "  I've only used plug-in types of tuners prior, and this was a nice surprise"}
{"source": "  I ran this through my ukulele, electric guitars as well as an electric bass"}
{"source": "  I was blown away how it could tune my bass"}
{"source": "  It works quickly, and it seems pretty accurate compared to my Petersen"}
{"source": "  I would recommend it to anyone"}
{"source": "  Took one star off for visibility"}
{"source": "  Certain lighting and certain angles can wash out the display very easily"}
{"source": "My eight year old finds this very easy to use on his violin"}
{"source": " It seems to be accurate, and he is now capable of tuning his violin by himself"}
{"source": "I used this to tune a coconut thumb piano"}
{"source": " If it can tune that, it should handle your guitar or bass FINE"}
{"source": " Was really impressed to see it in action"}
{"source": " NOT THE SMOOTHEST operation in the world but it's gig-bag small and accurate"}
{"source": "Works great and does a good job, a must have type tool for the price get one !!! Light takes up little space and easy to use "}
{"source": "I bought this to use on my Fender P-bass"}
{"source": " It is not reliable for me, sometimes it works and sometimes it can't find the low note correctly"}
{"source": " I'm still using my Roland stomp box tuner"}
{"source": " Glad this was inexpensive, it was not worth the hassle to return, i gave it away"}
{"source": "I had bought an SN2 and love it but I found it had a little trouble recognizing the low E on my bass"}
{"source": " This handles bass tuning much better"}
{"source": " The lit display is great for tuning on stage, and because it works on vibration you don't need to worry about muting when you are tuning"}
{"source": "I also find it very accurate"}
{"source": " I would have given it 5 stars but the battery died after a couple of weeks"}
{"source": " This is probably the seller and not the manufacturer"}
{"source": "I've had a few of these things, not all the same model"}
{"source": " This one was hard to read"}
{"source": " I changed the battery and that helped out quite a bit"}
{"source": " Overall I like it and use it on gigs instead of my pedal"}
{"source": "This tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly"}
{"source": " Clamp it on, press the power switch, and then  pluck a string"}
{"source": " It will tell you if you are hitting the right note and if it is in tune"}
{"source": "I only gave this 3 stars because the battery meter only indicated 1/2 charge out of the box"}
{"source": " It still had the plastic barrier that had to be removed to connect the battery"}
{"source": "  Shouldn't it have a full battery since it is brand new? Not enough of a hassle to send it back, but worth mentioning"}
{"source": "Had the battery not been an issue, I would have rated this 5 stars"}
{"source": "This is one of the best, simple to use, guitar tuners I've used -- and I've used a lot of them"}
{"source": "  The bonus is that it's also one of the least expensive that I've seen"}
{"source": "  You won't be disappointed"}
{"source": "I play guitar, bass and violin"}
{"source": "and more"}
{"source": " I have used many clip on tuners that are two and three times the cost and are just okay"}
{"source": " In fact that may be saying too much"}
{"source": "  I was really surprised at the Snark SN-5 tuner"}
{"source": "  I found it very accurate"}
{"source": "  I compared it to my Boss TU-2 tuner plugged in to the guitar and it was just as accurate and maybe a bit tighter"}
{"source": "  I decided to adjust my guitar intonation with the Snark (no one would ever do this"}
{"source": "this was a test) and it was very close to my stroboscope"}
{"source": "  I plan on buying the higher quality Snark tuner that supposed to be even tighter"}
{"source": "  Very impressed with this"}
{"source": " If I can take my tuner pedal out of the loop and off my board, I will be happy"}
{"source": "  These are cheap enough to buy one for each guitar so I don't have to move it around as I change guitars during performances"}
{"source": "I am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments "}
{"source": " wanted to like this "}
{"source": " but "}
{"source": "First the positives:- Looks great- nice, easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice priceNow the significant disappointment:- inaccurateThe settings were on A-440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp "}
{"source": " I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners "}
{"source": " very disappointing "}
{"source": " I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products, they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner (it has its place I guess, but I much prefer the larger one "}
{"source": " too bad they made this decision IMO) "}
{"source": "I haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models "}
{"source": "Bottom line, no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard A-440 "}
{"source": " having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation "}
{"source": "I've been playing guitar for over 25 years and been through many different style of tuners"}
{"source": " This is by far the best I've ever had"}
{"source": " Not only is it accurate and easy to use, but it's so convenient! Simply clip it to the head of the guitar, press the only button on the unit and start tuning"}
{"source": " Also, unlike other tuners I've used, this tuner does a great job of filtering/ignoring ambient noise in the room"}
{"source": " I can actually tune my guitar while having a conversation, even with the TV on in the room!Pro's:- Vibrant , easy to read display- No need for cords, chargers even when used on electric guitars/bass"}
{"source": "- Simple one button activation- Lightweight - I leave it on my classical guitar all the time, especially after restringing"}
{"source": "- Auto Shutoff (also can manually shut it off, just press the one button a second time)- Works for Guitar and Bass (both acoustic and electric) and violin - Also works on my Ukulele!Con's:Wish I had this 20 years ago!Bottom Line:This is a no-brainer"}
{"source": " The price, quality and easy of use make it a must have for any guitarist"}
{"source": "This is a very accurate tuner"}
{"source": " I have used it on mandolins, guitars, violins and violas, and double bass"}
{"source": " They are a little hard on batteries, but not overly so"}
{"source": "Highly recommend!"}
{"source": "I love the small size of this tuner, and it clips on to the guitar headstock firmly"}
{"source": " The tuner picks up vibrations, so it doesn't require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " There's just one button, so it's idiot-proof"}
{"source": " However, the button can get pushed to easily, so sometimes the tuner is on in my guitar case, running the battery out too soon"}
{"source": "Speaking of battery, the smallness of the tuner necessitates a small battery, but I hate that they used the CR2032 battery"}
{"source": " It just doesn't last long, and in Brazil, it's really hard to find this battery at all"}
{"source": "I own the SN-8, which btw, is the best tuner I've ever used"}
{"source": " I bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin"}
{"source": " So I wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin"}
{"source": " I was also intrigued by the &#34;tighter&#34; tuning aspect of the bars on this"}
{"source": " Let me tell you, if it worked, the bars may have been a cool feature, but when you are fine-tuning an A string and it tells you you are on E (when you know you are on A bc the other tuners all say A, and it matches the piano), then there is a problem"}
{"source": " I could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing, so it looks like it's just defective"}
{"source": " The one I received was completely useless"}
{"source": "I am amazed at the great SN-8"}
{"source": "I am disappointed in this thing"}
{"source": " I must have just received a dud (I hope, since these usually get good reviews), but I will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly"}
{"source": " On the flip side, I will be getting another SN-8 in it's place, since I know those are great tuners & I love the one I already have"}
{"source": "I love this tuner"}
{"source": " I have other similar models, and they are all great"}
{"source": "don't hesitate to get one"}
{"source": "These are three times as high at guitar center"}
{"source": "  how ridiculous"}
{"source": "ok"}
{"source": " this may sound silly, but just to let you know you can do it"}
{"source": "if you hold a stick or something similar touching your throat, and clip this tuner to it, you can tune your voice with it"}

{"source": "cracks me up, but fun to play with"}
{"source": "I own several tuners, and two Snark-2 tuners, which are great (except they're not low profile like theKorg Pitchclip Chromatic Clip On Guitar Tuner - Korg PC-1--please see my review of that tuner)"}
{"source": "So, since I needed another tuner for my ukulele, I ordered this time a Snark-6"}
{"source": "  This one says, specifically, for a ukulele"}
{"source": "  I wanted to try it compared to the Snark-2Snark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic TunerThe Snark-6 and Snark-2 are identical, except for color"}
{"source": "  The Uke tuner here is gloss black, and the Snark-2 is matte red"}
{"source": "  Otherwise, the size of the dial/face, the clip itself is precisely the same"}
{"source": "  So, there's nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2"}
{"source": "  The tuning is chromatic, so it's good for any specific instrument (mandolin, guitar, uke, banjo, etc"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "So, choose whichever color you prefer, and go for it"}
{"source": "  Sweet tuner"}
{"source": "  Superb graphics on the dial, colorful accurate, and inexpensive (but not \"cheap\" build, like the Korg)"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended tuner"}
{"source": "I bought this to use primarily with my newly bought Ukulele, but it also works perfectly to tune my old acoustic guitar too"}
{"source": " The display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate"}
{"source": " I wish I'd bought one of these years ago instead of tuning my stringed instruments manually \"by ear\""}
{"source": " Until now I'd assumed I tuned my instruments perfectly well, but this unit proved me wrong - both my Uke and guitar sound better after being fine tuned with this"}
{"source": "This little gadget saves time, improves tuning accuracy and is absolutely perfect for the job it is designed for"}
{"source": "It comes supplied with a CR2032 battery and a basic protective bag to keep it in when not in use"}
{"source": "Anyone who cares to take the time to look at my other reviews will see that I am not fond of the Snark displays"}
{"source": "  I prefer the \"needle\" type because it's symmetric above and below center while the Snark has red turning off when flat and gold turning on when sharp"}
{"source": "  However, that's me and YMMV, as they say on the Internet"}
{"source": "Don't ask, then, why I got a SN-6"}
{"source": "  I don't smoke, drink, or womanize, the unit is cheap, the money's got to go somewhere, and I like to play with accessories"}
{"source": "I am fond of saying that it doesn't matter which type of tuner you use because they've pretty much become a commodity"}
{"source": "  They all tune well with the same accuracy, so it comes down to looks and price"}
{"source": "Well, that's not *quite* true"}
{"source": "  Some models suffer fits in certain situations"}
{"source": "  The rapid fall of the old Intellitouch was, in my mind, not due to price as much as its inability to deal with the low E string on a Martin dreadnought"}
{"source": "  A web search will reveal countless workarounds"}
{"source": "  I (and the rest of the world, apparently) buy a tuner to tune, not work around"}
{"source": "Lately, I've become enamored of theKala KA-UBASSFS Solid Mahogany U-BASS - Fretted"}
{"source": "  If you want a tuning challenge, the low bass E string is it"}
{"source": "  The SN-6 hardly hiccups"}
{"source": "  Other tuners seem to do \"okay\" but require a little coaxing"}
{"source": "  Not the SN-6! That's 5 stars in my book!"}
{"source": "This is my third Snark tuner, I keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear"}
{"source": " I use it on all my stringed instruments, (Haven't tried it on a base) This tuner is easy to attach and read, and the price is great, I have spent 60 bucks on tuners that do not function as well"}
{"source": "I ordered the Hola! and the Snark SN-6 to preview for my senior adult ukulele players at church"}
{"source": "  I've spent the last week or so tuning a large group of 20 or so ukuleles twice a day to allow them to &#34;settle in&#34;"}
{"source": "  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent"}
{"source": "  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one"}
{"source": "  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone"}
{"source": "The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store"}
{"source": "  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark"}
{"source": "  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need"}
{"source": "  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther"}
{"source": "  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read"}
{"source": "  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are"}
{"source": "  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!"}
{"source": "Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function"}
{"source": "  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off)"}
{"source": "  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician"}
{"source": "  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano"}
{"source": "  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes"}
{"source": "  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments"}
{"source": "The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction"}
{"source": "  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark"}
{"source": "  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient"}
{"source": "  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar"}
{"source": "The Snark comes with a baggy and a reclosable, cardboard box"}
{"source": "  I have no problem with it, but the Hola! stores better"}
{"source": "  I don't really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a &#34;ukulele&#34; setting"}
{"source": "  It's a chromatic tuner"}
{"source": "  It very well may be sized differently from their other models to fit better on ukuleles"}
{"source": "  Other than that, I'm not quite sure what makes it specifically a &#34;Ukulele tuner&#34;"}
{"source": "I personally own two of these Snarks and I've seen several others among my friends"}
{"source": "  They're great, easy-to-read and easy-to-use tuners that are surprisingly cheap"}
{"source": "However, half of the Snarks I've come into contact with have broken within a few weeks"}
{"source": "  One of mine broke after about 2 weeks of very light usage"}
{"source": "  The screen is SUPER faint"}
{"source": "  It's still tuning and displaying but without any back lighting"}
{"source": "  This also happened to two of my friend's Snarks"}
{"source": "My other Snark is still going strong"}
{"source": "  I'd still recommend them for non-critical applications just for the price and ease of use"}
{"source": "  However, these definitely aren't reliable gig-worthy tuners"}
{"source": "  They're just so cheap it's easy to buy multiple Snarks and cover all of your guitars"}
{"source": "If you are like me, my research for a guitar connection to my iPad left me with choosing between the iRiffport and the Jam"}
{"source": "  I recently purchased, and then returned, the iRiffport"}
{"source": "  I am very pleased that I purchased the Apogee Jam as a replacement"}
{"source": "  Here are the reasons why:1) The connector on the iRiffport (the one that goes into the iPad) is not a strong connection at all; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time"}
{"source": "  I have a stand to put my iPad on when jamming such that the iPad is in landscape mode, so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way"}
{"source": "  With the Apogee Jam, the connector is just like the iPad's connector, except it ALSO has the \"prongs\" that come out of it, securing the connector into the iPad"}
{"source": "  To remove the connector from the iPad, you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the \"prongs\" go in so it can be removed"}
{"source": "very, very secure"}
{"source": "  I use the \"Gumdrop\" case on my iPad, which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used"}
{"source": "  This flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used"}
{"source": "  IMPORTANT:  if you have such an iPad case, like me, I certainly feel that the Jam will provide a much more secure connection to your iPad over the iRiffport"}
{"source": "  In fact, the structure of the iRiffport connector was so large, that I felt that it did not fit well through my case"}
{"source": "  On the other hand, the Jam's connector is the same small size as the iPad's original connector"}
{"source": "  This is also something to consider if you intend to use your iPad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the iPad"}
{"source": "2) Probably the largest reason I prefer the Jam over the iRiffport:  you can hear sound directly from the iPad"}
{"source": "  With the iRiffport, you MUST use headphones or attach external speakers"}
{"source": "  I tried headphones with the iRiffport and playing the guitar was very awkward"}
{"source": "  Nonetheless, with the Jam, I could attach headphones or external speakers to the iPad if I chose to do so"}
{"source": "  I wanted something that could make my iPad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house, without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers"}
{"source": "  With the Jam, I have this"}
{"source": "3) The Jam has a gain meter (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", an LED) and a gain control"}
{"source": "  The iRiffport does not"}
{"source": "  When not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio, the LED lets you know if you are connected to the iPad, but not to any software (blue light), or if you are connected to the iPad AND to a software application (green light)"}
{"source": "  There are no batteries needed for the Jam or the iRiffport"}
{"source": "4) I personally like that I can use my own guitar cord with the Jam"}
{"source": "  If the cord breaks, I simply replace the cord, not my iPad connection device"}
{"source": "  The iRiffport uses its own cord, and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my \"normal\" guitar cable I used with the Jam"}
{"source": "5)  Although a fairly minor point, it is nice to know that the Jam is advertised by Apple (look at their website and their Garageband video)"}
{"source": "  And, since I have Garageband on my iPad, I was pleased to see that the advertising material on the Jam states specifically that it works with Garageband"}
{"source": "So far, I'm very pleased with the Jam"}
{"source": "Can't believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector"}
{"source": "  I have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector"}
{"source": "  This is now a boat anchor"}
{"source": "  To buy a 3 meter cable from them, they charge $40 for the cable, $15 to ship it and then tax"}
{"source": "  The extortion here is almost Monster cable like"}
{"source": "  These folks should be embarassed"}
{"source": "My only reluctance about getting this was I thought the price was a little higher than it needed to be but I unboxed and connected this little dealie up and it does exactly what it says it does: it gets down my guitar tracks in iPad and sounds terrific so the $99"}
{"source": "00 price tag isn't such a big deal"}
{"source": "  NO learning curve, simply connect the included cable from the Jam to your 30-pin iPad dock, plug in your guitar, pull up GarageBand, select an amp, click on the icon in GarageBand that shows the guitar cable end, then select \"On\" for monitoring, hit record and start jamming, man - that is ALL there is to it"}
{"source": "  I've not been one to record on computers for a long time, preferring instead to use such things as Fostex 8-track recorders, Behringer mixers, Digitech effect pedals, etc"}
{"source": " but this is going to change all that"}
{"source": "  Awesome product with excellent sound quality and could not be simpler to use"}
{"source": "  UPDATE:  I mentioned a Behringer mixer above (Xenyx 802)"}
{"source": " I discovered that this Apogee Jam will take the signal routed (standard guitar type 1/4 in"}
{"source": " cable) from the Behringer's control out (L- mono) thus allowing you to use the mixer for multiple inputs, both microphone & guitar"}
{"source": " The sound quality doing this is excellent, I've recorded a guitar and vocal track and it worked beautifully"}
{"source": "  You just have to be careful not to overdrive the Jam"}
{"source": " Consequently, my opinion of the Apogee Jam is even higher than it was when I wrote my initial review in March"}
{"source": "  I may not even need that Focusrite box now!"}
{"source": "What was thought to be a DOA model, ended up being a mistake on my behalf"}
{"source": " My iPhone 4S, which I have had for about a year now, must've had enough damage and wear to the dock connector so that it works fine"}
{"source": "unless trying to use the JAM"}
{"source": "In The Box: Comes with a simple instruction manual that has about three steps"}
{"source": "It comes with the JAM and two cables (USB and IOS)"}
{"source": " It is bigger than I had imaginedIt's almost the length of an iPhone"}
{"source": " Feels nice, and is very light"}
{"source": " The cords aren't very long"}
{"source": "Love this stuff"}
{"source": " Think I ordered it twice"}
{"source": " Much better than standard industrial strength velcro"}
{"source": " Just works, so what else more can I say?"}
{"source": "I love this tape for multiple reasons, one because when it's on, it's on and not going to come off with bumps or gigging hard or what not, but at the same time if you would need to reassemble your board and want to move pedals around, you can take it off"}
{"source": " It won't be easy, but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off"}
{"source": " I was able to get everything off my older board, and it came off so clean I was actually able to sell it! So this is some good stuff! Be prepared to buy a few rolls though for an entire board of pedals, as it hooks to itself so you'll go through it pretty quickly"}
{"source": "When I made a larger pedal board (from plywood) to accommodate a new pedal tuner, I could not pull the power-grip tape from the old board to reuse it! The adhesive is extremely strong, and the unique locking surface is almost as strong"}
{"source": " Works great"}
{"source": "What a fantastic product! I believe I have been wishing for this for years!Only one problem"}
{"source": " Make sure that you want that pedal there - because once it sticks - you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot"}
{"source": "No longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel - they actually stay attached to the pedal board!I have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards - this stuff works and is T-U-F-F!I you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need!I just wish I could get paid for endorsing this product!*********************************Still holding strong - building another board and using this stuff - it's much better than regular velcro - I don't have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit - use this and that annoying issue goes away"}
{"source": "I have never played a string instrument"}
{"source": " and it looks like I'll be able to get the hang of this very quickly"}
{"source": " Only problem is the strings"}
{"source": " Sting one "}
{"source": " play's &#34;dead&#34; meaning it will not stay in-tune"}
{"source": " Not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem"}
{"source": " Have another set of strings [better quality] and will try that set soon"}
{"source": "This is a great package for beginners"}
{"source": " I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago"}
{"source": "  I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called \"Easy Ukelele\" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free"}
{"source": "  That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune"}
{"source": " I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it"}
{"source": " I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out"}
{"source": "My Review:1"}
{"source": " The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings"}
{"source": " Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the \"Easy Ukelele\" app I mentioned above"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " The Ukelele:  The Ukelele looks and feels decent"}
{"source": " It has a sticker that says made in china"}
{"source": " It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune"}
{"source": "  I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune"}
{"source": " It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings"}
{"source": "  Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments"}
{"source": "  Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle"}
{"source": " I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side"}
{"source": "  I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension"}
{"source": " The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string"}
{"source": "  It could be that the string included is a cheap one"}
{"source": "  After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine)"}
{"source": "  But after 1 song, you have to tune it again"}
{"source": "  I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs"}
{"source": " Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning"}
{"source": " I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem"}
{"source": "  This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range"}
{"source": " I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more"}
{"source": " Even if I have to tune it every day  I would not have any problem with it"}
{"source": "So, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle"}
{"source": " This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in"}
{"source": " Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9"}
{"source": "00 for a set"}
{"source": "  Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension"}
{"source": " If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little"}
{"source": "  That is an easy fix"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles"}
{"source": " Even if you buy a  good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning"}
{"source": " It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed"}
{"source": " The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it"}
{"source": "  From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string"}
{"source": " The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string"}
{"source": " The extra string package says \"Gangia Brand\" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners"}
{"source": " The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons"}
{"source": " Each song have a chart on which chord you will use"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " The Case:  The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop"}
{"source": "5"}
{"source": " The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book"}
{"source": " I will come back and edit this item once I get the chance to watch the DVD and listen to the CD"}
{"source": "Overall"}
{"source": " This is a great price for the package"}
{"source": "Love the ukulele,  and the book is okay,, shows cords but the songs are very outdated,,  you tube is your friend when learning the uku"}
{"source": "Update : I got a tenor uku for Xmas adn bought a concert uku just because, I love them both more than this little guy although it does travel with me and I just forked out money for a hardshell case so it wont get beat up as much in my suitcase by American Airlines,( just ruined my suitcase)anyhow,  it has been going out of tune for awhile now ( c string fattest one)  and I just figured out my bridge is lifting, there are two rivets holding it down and there is a board inside although not a very thick one,,will be putting a new piece on the inside and some good wood glue under the bridge and let it dry,,,  if the bridge falls apart again, I will be smashing the box and making a Banjo uku with the neck,,if you think you are really going to like playing, go for a concert or tenor,,  if you are liking the size spend a bit of money, this is pretty much the same as my grand daughters 20 dollar ebay ukulele I bought myself 4 years ago and gave to my 3 yo grand daughter because that one too would not stay in tune"}
{"source": "I tried this in front, in the middle, and at the end of an effects chain, as well as by itself, plugged into the effects loop of my Mesa Boogie Mark V amplifier"}
{"source": "  Whenever it is in the path, as soon as I engage my effects loop, the signal level drops considerably"}
{"source": "  It did not matter whether the pedal was on or not"}
{"source": "  The chorus effect is good, but I don't want my volume to drop every time I turn on my effects loop"}
{"source": "  I have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that I use, so I can't raise the send any more"}
{"source": "This pedal has a great range of function (with variable width and depth) along with an independent level control, and tone controls for low and high frequency cutoffs"}
{"source": " It also has a dry through output"}
{"source": "It can go from low depth high speed shimmers, to high depth, low speed oscillations, to ridiculous warble"}
{"source": "The pedal is light weight, very high quality, durable, quite good looking, and all around a good pedal to play around with"}
{"source": "Cons: The blue led, like many blue leds, is VERY bright; I usually cover them up with a sticker so I can see the setting on the pedal"}
{"source": "It can also be easy to accidentally touch the pedal casing with the positive barrel of when plugging in (this can frighteningly spark)"}
{"source": " So make sure to plug in the power adapted into the pedal before plugging in the wall"}
{"source": "I had sworn off Chorus pedals years ago, the sounded so sterile and digital the sucked the tone out your guitar and amp and made everything sound the same"}
{"source": " Not with the MXR Analog Chorus, very musical and transparent, I like the presets recommended in the instruction manual"}
{"source": " the stereo out is very cool for using two amps "}
{"source": " and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank and will last forever"}
{"source": " By the way this is the exact same pedal as the Zak Wylde chorus pedal with out all the cheese paint job , not all of us are metal heads"}
{"source": "I had used some Boss CE-5 and CH-1 and substituted them with this unit"}
{"source": " It's has a cool analog/vintage sound of chours"}
{"source": "This cable is an amazing find"}
{"source": " It simply works! I am not sure if some of the cables others have reviewed have had loose wiring in them, but the cable I received is perfect"}
{"source": "I plugged the cable into my Windows laptop, waited 30 seconds while it recognized the cable and installed drivers, and I was good to go"}
{"source": " I plugged in a dynamic microphone, opened the Audacity software program, hit record and it was amazing sound quality"}
{"source": " I had previously used a variety of input devices from a JamHub to a Behringer USB line input device to an Art audio preamp to even going low-budget with just a cable directly into the microphone input of the (ThinkPad) laptop"}
{"source": " This cable provides as high quality of an audio signal as any other reasonably priced device I have used"}
{"source": "There are, however, a few limitations"}
{"source": "- This cable is mono only, i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " not for stereo recording"}
{"source": " This seems obvious, but is worth mentioning for those who have less experience with this type of stuff"}
{"source": "- This cable only works with Dynamic Microphones"}
{"source": " If your microphone is a Condenser microphone, you either need a battery powered microphone or some type of 'phantom' power source to power the condenser microphone"}
{"source": "The really good things?- This cable works excellent at providing a good signal level to the Audacity software"}
{"source": " Some input devices are either very hot (too much level) or have hardly any gain at all, so this cable works very well by providing just the right level"}
{"source": "- This cable works amazingly well with a direct box to record a bass guitar, acoustic/electric guitar, keyboard, etc"}
{"source": " I have a lot of direct boxes and this works well on all of them"}
{"source": " I was able to record a bass guitar track with about the least amount of fuss ever (think three minutes setup time from thinking of the idea to hitting record) using just this cable and a Hosa www"}
{"source": "amazon"}
{"source": "com/gp/product/B000WS1Q4E/ direct box I purchased from Amazon as well"}
{"source": "I can put 5 electric guitars in gig bags on this stand"}
{"source": " It is solid and no problems with itafter 6 months use"}
{"source": " Assembly was pretty easy and took little time"}
{"source": "After having collected a few guiters through the years I needed the kind of stand to hold certain ones in particular"}
{"source": "Good for any beginner, but consultation with a teacher, if you have one, is recommended"}
{"source": "  For ham fisted persons, positioning is not easy; for lossening strings, proper bridge resetting, and exact measuring of string length from the nut to the bridge is required"}
{"source": "  Measuring requires a hard ruler with a full 330 milimeters (325 required) - bet you don't have one - or a technician's measuring tape and confident measuring skill"}
{"source": "  Measuring is best with a cooperative assistant"}
{"source": "  Bridge distance can be first set by good measurement and tightening the D string to hold the bridge position, measurement check, tightening the A string, measurement check, removal of the backing material and good positioning of the guide while eliminating the bubbles followed by tightening the 1st and 4th strings and tuning the instrument"}
{"source": " Do it!  You'll appreciate your instrument a lot more than it takes to just pick it up and start practicing"}
{"source": "  If you ain't intelligent, Good Luck!  You'd best be served with dot stickers"}
{"source": "Excellent picks, with nicely rounded corners to the essentially triangular shape and nicely beveled edges to make tremolo playing easy and smooth"}
{"source": "  The only problem I have is that I keep changing my mind between whether I want a crisp corner for my picking for clarity or a pick like these for smoother playing"}
{"source": "  These are a great addition to any mandolin player's case because they give the player a nice alternative to trying to use one of the rounded corners on a pick like a Fender heavy"}
{"source": "These picks are comparable in shape and feel to Grisman's Dawg Picks (and frankly, cheaper)"}
{"source": " The thickness and rounded bevel will absorb a lot of high end from your tone and, depending on how you play, this may or may not be acceptable"}
{"source": "In my opinion, if you play with a relatively free and loose wrist, without anchoring your fingers or palm on the mandolin face or bridge, you'll get a woody, warm tone with plenty of definition and good volume"}
{"source": " Varying the horizontal contact point along the strings can bring out a bit more high end"}
{"source": " I play this way and am more than satisfied with the picks"}
{"source": " (For guitar I prefer a 1 mm traditional tri-corner shape but that's a different review)"}
{"source": " If, however, you're really a fan of a biting high treble sound, these picks are probably not your best choice unless you're willing to put a sharper edge on the bevel with a file and fine sandpaper"}
{"source": " In fact, a pack of 12 three corner picks can be an economic way to experiment with pick shape and bevel angle if you're searching for your ideal tone"}
{"source": "If you support your hand by resting your palm or fingers on the mandolin, chances are your attack, tone and volume are generally softer and I think these picks will produce an unacceptably dull tone"}
{"source": " Tweaking the shape may still leave you feeling as though you're not benefiting from the large mass of the pick and it's just slowing you down"}
{"source": " For such a lighter stroke, I'd recommend the 1 mm tri-corner I use for guitar"}
{"source": "Picks are personal thing and even then everyone seems to change once in a while"}
{"source": "  I really like the feel of this hard little pick with the round edge, which gives a warm round sound, but if you like to have the bluegrass banjo sound, all you need to do is file down one edge to what you'd like and you can have it all"}
{"source": "  Great pick, I recommend it"}
{"source": "I chose this rating because even though it is an Epiphone, a Les Paul and affiliation with Gibson it is made in China NOT the USA as one would think by the name affiliations"}
{"source": "  I think that fact should be pointed out in the advertisement that is is NOT a USA product"}
{"source": " When opened, the white pick guard as showen in the picture was missing from the body of the instrument but I did find it in the pocket of the soft carry case"}
{"source": " The white pick guard should have come attached to the body from the factory"}
{"source": " So someone messed up in QUALITY CONTROL"}
{"source": " With that said, I find the finished look is fine without the guard, the tone sounds good when not electrified and the sound is good when electrified"}
{"source": " I decided NOT to send it back because everything else appeared ok when using it"}
{"source": "The ukulele is very cool looking, it plays nice, it doesn't sound as nice as a more expensive ukulele, it comes with cheap strings, but it's a very fun ukulele"}
{"source": "  I think it's worth a hundred dollars"}
{"source": "I really like Epiphone products"}
{"source": " They are well-made, easy to play guitars"}
{"source": " I also purchased an Ep Les Paul Special 2 Ebony from Amazon a while back"}
{"source": " But, I received this Uke defective"}
{"source": " I expected when I plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but I couldn't here anything at all"}
{"source": " Totally dead"}
{"source": " There are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down"}
{"source": " I'm disappointed because I expect Gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory"}
{"source": " I actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when I got over to his house and it didn't work in front of him"}
{"source": " I just requested a return/exchange from Amazon"}
{"source": " If the next one works ok I may buy a second one for me"}
{"source": " I seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through Amazon"}
{"source": " I had to send back my Dean 12 string elec-acoust to Amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem"}
{"source": "  I do want to state that this is a beautiful Uke with nice feeling nylon strings, fine wood high polished surface, high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically"}
{"source": "  The actual guitar looks even BETTER in person than in the picture"}
{"source": " If this Uke was working 100% I would have given it a 4 or 5"}
{"source": "I love this uke! it came fast"}
{"source": " such a solid built uke feels like a les paul nice and sturdy!sounds amazing, intonation is perfect and never slips out of tune"}
{"source": " it has a nice mellowtone unplugged and when you plug it in it sounds amazing! the finish is amazing perfectone of my favorite instruments i ever, owned totally worth buying for the priceyou will not regret it!"}
{"source": "Dunno how, but mine came with no cable and the pickguard wasn't installed"}
{"source": "  The pickguard is no biggie, I actually didn't want it on there (it seems oversized to me)"}
{"source": "  If I wanted it on there tho, it's got a peel off sticky back"}
{"source": "  Not having a cable was kinda a big deal"}
{"source": "  I sent an email to Epiphone (Gibson), got a response within a day and after sending in proof of purchase, they promised to send me a cable"}
{"source": "  Nice customer service"}
{"source": "As far as the Uke, the finish on mine was perfect, no blemishes I can see"}
{"source": "  I did change out the strings, and it does sound a 'little' better I suppose, but not that much"}
{"source": "  Probably would have messed around on the stock strings a bit longer, but I listened to the reviews and did a change right away"}
{"source": "  For $100, if you want a uke, this one looks awesome and plays well"}
{"source": "I don't know how much you can say about picks, but this is a versatile pack"}
{"source": " You get a multitude of types and there are 2 of each thickness"}
{"source": " If you use a variety of picks or are wanting to test out other types of picks, this is for you"}
{"source": "Not cheap as far as pics are concerned, but it's definitely nice to get a variety pack now and then"}
{"source": "  If you're new, it helps you find what you like"}
{"source": "  if you're experience, you might like to keep different pics around while searching for that new sound"}
{"source": "The sampler pack was a good variety of pick thicknesse and are useful in finding out what type of picks are most useful in playing various guitar styles"}
{"source": "MY THUMB GOT SORE!  I HADN'T PLAYED ANY OF MY STRING INSTRUMENTS FOR SOME TIME"}
{"source": "  THE FINGER TIPS ON MY LEFT HAND WERE NO LONGER CALLUSED AND MY RIGHT UKULELE STRUMMING THUMB WAS TENDER FROM BEING OUT OF PRACTICE"}
{"source": "  HENCE MY PURCHASE OF THESE FELT PICKS"}
{"source": "  THE PICKS ARE FINE"}
{"source": "  THEY ARE USEFUL"}
{"source": "  MY ONLY COMMENT IS THAT I REALLY LIKE A FELT PICK THAT IS THICKER AND A LITTLE SOFTER"}
{"source": "  THESE ARE GOOD BUT DIFFERENT"}
{"source": "We purchased these because they were recommended to be used with the Ukulele"}
{"source": "  They seem to make a damper sound rather than allowing the strings to make music"}
{"source": "  Not sure I would buy these again"}
{"source": " But great to give the kids when I don't want to hear 6 Uke's practicing at the same time"}
{"source": "As a classical guitarist, I have never touched a pick to my nylon strings"}
{"source": "  As a recent ukulele enthusiast, however, I have a little different approach"}
{"source": "  In a group, if all are acoustic, a lead line of some sort has to push through the strummers"}
{"source": "  I tried these"}
{"source": "  Nothing against them"}
{"source": "  They are good for strumming"}
{"source": "  For lead, I needed to use something harder"}
{"source": "  I went to a soft plastic or nylon pick"}
{"source": "  It will still not be too good for the strings, but it does the sonic job I need"}
{"source": "For a nice strum, these are fine"}
{"source": "Recently got the itch to try some different picks out just for fun"}
{"source": " these, rubber picks, metal picks, etc"}
{"source": " I play guitar"}
{"source": "I'm not crazy about these for that purpose, but they aren't made for guitar obviously, so I can't fault them"}
{"source": " They seem to be made well made"}
{"source": " They are larger than I expected, and rather thick"}
{"source": "Obviously these are made for ukes, so my review is probably not helpful to many"}
{"source": " If you're like me and were looking for some variety for the guitar I'd suggest the rubber picks instead"}
{"source": " They give a similar mellow sound without mudding up the tone, and they are easier and more comfortable to use also"}
{"source": " Heck, maybe uke players should try those too?"}
{"source": "Well I guess it works? I don't know what I was expecting"}
{"source": " I was hoping to get something cheap but that works for my classic guitar"}
{"source": " I had to tie the other end around the guitar area but I don't know I guess it is okay it doesn't really bother me it is just that I wasnt expecting it"}
{"source": " Also the actual band where I can put around my body is not THAT comfortable but it is okay and I can move around in it and secure it to my body"}
{"source": "I've used this mic with my Tascam US-800 Audio Interface, and PC, to record a high school chorus concert, and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone"}
{"source": " I placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone, and one as a piano/instrument microphone, and have gotten great results from both"}
{"source": " The reproduction of the sound was very good"}
{"source": " The mic seems very solid in build, and able to possibly take a little abuse, which is good with a travelling recording system, but I definately wouldn't TRY dropping one, even though they're a nice metal case, and metal grill"}
{"source": " I'd recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals, and instrumentals, on a budget"}
{"source": " I have yet to try these with micing guitar amps, but that's my next step, as well as drums"}
{"source": "I ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap, the first one arrived in non working condition, wires inside werent even soldered, so i ordered a replacement, plugged it in and it didnt work either, the second wasnt soldered either"}
{"source": "I know its cheap, but i expected it to at least work, do not buy"}
{"source": "OK, I just got this mic in the mail a few hours ago"}
{"source": " I did a little comparison to a pretty old SM57 that I've have since 1990ish and it was actually very good"}
{"source": " The Pyle has more gain then the old 57 and as for sound I would say they are damn near identical to my ear"}
{"source": " I did the A/B test by mic'ing a guitar cab and recording a hi gain metal guitar riff trying my best to keep the mic's in the very same positions"}
{"source": " I would recommend for sure"}
{"source": " Here's a link to an A/B comparison I did with an SM57"}
{"source": " ["}
{"source": "]"}
{"source": "This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables"}
{"source": " The included cable is light duty, but not bad if you treat it with respect"}
{"source": "The mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows, smooth midrange and crisp highs"}
{"source": " For almost any singer or announcer, this will be just what they need"}
{"source": " The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise, making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production"}
{"source": " The sound is unbelievable, especially at this price"}
{"source": " For under twenty dollars, this Pyle-Pro mike can't be beat"}
{"source": "One issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam DR40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable, the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics"}
{"source": " Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem, but both mikes work perfectly with any other device"}
{"source": " The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue, but usually not when using the XLR input"}
{"source": "They're round and they fit over microphones"}
{"source": "  Work well to stop pops and lisps"}
{"source": "  Have been very happy with them"}
{"source": "These foam mike covers do exactly what they are made to do, and they do it just about average as you expect"}
{"source": " My only complaint is they come packaged in a bag that allows them to be crushed and mis-shaped upon delivery"}
{"source": " If your mike has a big enough ball, the ball will reshape the foam"}
{"source": " Otherwise the foam will never have that nice smooth, round look to it"}
{"source": "I wanted a wall hanger for my mandolin, and this works great"}
{"source": "  The arms are adjustable, so the instrument won't rest on the pegs"}
{"source": "  The foam is good, and the hardware is included"}
{"source": "  Plus, the price is great"}
{"source": "I've got three of these to hold an acoustic, a mini strat, and a jazzmaster "}
{"source": " while I had no doubts about their capacity to hold the former I was somewhat leary about the later (it's quite a bit heavier than the other two) but after putting some weight on it and it not coming apart I have been trusting it "}
{"source": "Do Not fix these directly into drywall with the screws provided though they seem awfully small for the weight of a full-size electric (and I have my doubts about those plugs), the hanger will hold but the drywall might not, get some good wall anchors at your local hardware store rated for at least the weight of your instrument"}
{"source": " I used a different setup, #10 philips (slotted round heads would have actually been better) to fix them to a nice piece of 3/4 x 6 x 6 pine and screwed that into the studs with some 2"}
{"source": "5\" #12 screws"}
{"source": " Needless to say it's not going anywhere"}
{"source": " As a bonus of this scheme even the acoustic hangs free of the wall"}
{"source": "OK, one month later and nothing has come down so clearly they work fine even for something as heavy as a Jazzmaster"}
{"source": "What makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently"}
{"source": " If you have a standard size guitar neck, don't bother with that"}
{"source": " I would have preferred something that was stationary that I could just stick the guitar in"}
{"source": " As it is I have to jiggle and align it a bit, using 2 hands sometimes, which will be annoying after awhile"}
{"source": " If I buy another it would be a standard hanger"}
{"source": "I have purchased a few guitar hooks in the past for my studio"}
{"source": " However, I wanted to add a few to our rehearsal space but didn't want to spend a lot"}
{"source": " These did the trick fine"}
{"source": " They are perfect to rest your axe for a bit without a guitar stand getting in your way"}
{"source": " Especially for the price"}
{"source": " Okay, they are not high end, but I didn't need high end ones"}
{"source": "I just received my Blue Radius Shock Mount, and I was immediately floored by the the size and looks of the unit"}
{"source": " It reminds me a set piece from Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\", the rings around Saturn or something built by Tesla"}
{"source": " It's a beautiful thing, certain to impress anyone who might sit in front of it to be recorded"}
{"source": " Certainly beats the homemade 4 inch PVC pipe and bungee cord shock mount I previously had made and my Yeti mounted to"}
{"source": " What is impressive about this mount is you have full and clear access to the the Yeti's 3 knob's, mute switch and USB/Headphone plugs on the bottom of the mic, whereas my homemade version gave me fits with knob access"}
{"source": " Once you screw the Yeti into the machined shock mount base, there are teflon or maybe white delrin washers which allow you to swivel the mic easily to access the back knobs or move it toward any position, say a guest speaker with great ease"}
{"source": " The build is hefty, machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws"}
{"source": " The elastic suspension bands are not going to fly across the room, as they do on most shock mounts, because they are not threaded on hooks, but securely fastened to brackets, then the holding screws"}
{"source": " The Radius also allows you to mount the Yeti on a boom stand, upside down, which I have always been told is the best way to mount a condenser type mic so dust and moisture (spit) does not build up near the capsules or internal electronics, it just falls, as gravity allows"}
{"source": "Does a shock mount make a difference in sound? To my ears, yes, especially if you are recording into say, a laptop on a table, the fans and hard drive are going to vibrate, coloring your overall sound with unwanted hum"}
{"source": " Although the mic stand the Yeti comes with does an O"}
{"source": "K"}
{"source": " job of dampening vibration, it is not going to give you as much isolation as the Radius, which will be noticed when the gain controls are turned up"}
{"source": " There is also the science of unwanted resonance from instruments, rooms or cabs vibrating your stands, that's why you see most professional studios using shock mounts, you just get a cleaner sound"}
{"source": " In a test, the Radius works like a charm, even from pounding on my mixing desk"}
{"source": " A 9"}
{"source": "0 earthquake is not going to cause any vibration"}
{"source": "On the down side, just to play Devils Advocate, The Radius is huge, and may nor be suitable for tight spots or portability"}
{"source": " That said, the Yeti is also a big microphone, and once mounted, may add six inches to the overall space you will need to use this setup properly"}
{"source": " Next, when you un mount the Yeti from it's built in stand, you are going to have gaping screw holes in the side of the mic"}
{"source": " I fixed that by screwing the old Yeti stand screws back into the holes, which actually looks kind of neat to me"}
{"source": " To some maybe, it will look like bolts in the Frankenstein Monsters neck, but I think it all fits together"}
{"source": " Next, smaller base microphone stands will want to tip, either angle the Yeti plus Radius back, or get a bigger stand, this is the one I have and would highly reccomend, theSamson SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand"}
{"source": " Lastly, this mount will only work, as far as I can see, with a Blue Yeti or Blue Yeti Pro microphone, maybe some other mics will work, but not likely"}
{"source": "In conclusion, the Radius is an easy set up, works great and makes a Yeti look retro/futuristic sexy! Yeah it actually looks really cool, like a spaceship blasting off or landing, take your pick, I know people coming into my studio are going to say, \"What The heck is that, and where can I get one!?\" I may tease and say it's and award or art piece"}
{"source": "Addendum 12/13/2011If you thread another shock mount into the Radius, you get double protection"}
{"source": " It also looks great to talent in your studio"}
{"source": " Over Kill or Uber Cool, you decide"}
{"source": " See Pictures"}
{"source": "It did not perform"}
{"source": " Looks cool, but thats it"}
{"source": " Very large and inconvenient"}
{"source": " Would not recommend this because I would not recommend the blue yeti"}
{"source": "I started doing quite a bit of VoiceOver work at work and needed to get the yeti microphone up and off of my desk"}
{"source": " After attaching it to a microphone stand I found too much noise transition in my recordings and needed to isolate the Yeti Microphone"}
{"source": "  This seemed like the best option for that"}
{"source": "Upon installing the mount I had to take it all apart to get the microphone orientation right in the holder so that the microphone diaphragm was facing me"}
{"source": " Straight out of the package this is designed to be mounted straight on with the stand directly in front of you"}
{"source": " Unfortunately, if your microphone stand is coming from the sides, you have to take the inner ring out, rotate it to where you want it, and reattach the rubber bands"}
{"source": "  Easy enough as I completed this is one minute"}
{"source": "After using it for a while, the isolation is good, but not great"}
{"source": " I think the bands are a little tight for this microphone"}
{"source": " I see online that blue uses this same isolator on a bunch of different mics making this a universal holder"}
{"source": "  This probally works great for the heavier applications but the bands are so tight on this mic that it is almost a solid mount"}
{"source": " It needs to bounce a little more to truley isolate it fom its surroundings"}
{"source": " I have other isolators in my studio that have much heavier mics and way softer bands"}
{"source": "Going to get a replacement band from another provider and install it on this unit to see if it makes a difference"}
{"source": "It's does its job, it just could do it better with softer bands"}
{"source": "This is my first mixer"}
{"source": " I'd been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from USB-powered mics like the Blue Snowball to something a little more professional and, of course, that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups"}
{"source": "Thus, I am an amateur and you'll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional"}
{"source": "Anyway, my pros and consPros1"}
{"source": " This thing is way smaller than I expected"}
{"source": " I can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesn't take up a lot of desk space"}
{"source": " It fits well where I put it"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " It works as intended"}
{"source": " I use this with a GLS ES-57 mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good"}
{"source": " I have my windows volume set at 75 and the gain is up at about 60%"}
{"source": " I have no hissing and no problems"}
{"source": " I did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co-host (we do it over Skype) said I sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good"}
{"source": " This is a stark improvement over the Blue Snowball"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": " It's plug and play"}
{"source": " I plugged it in, it installed the drivers, and it automatically set itself as the default microphone"}
{"source": " Easy peasy"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": " I use Reaper as my audio software and Reaper recognized it immediately"}
{"source": "5"}
{"source": " The dials and everything was easy to understand"}
{"source": "Cons1"}
{"source": " You can't plug this into a USB hub (or even an AC-powered USB hub) otherwise you'll get a hiss"}
{"source": " This needs to be plugged directly into a computer"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": " This high-jacks your audio defaults in Windows"}
{"source": " To fix it, open your Control Panel, open the Sound, and set your Playback device to your speakers to fix the problem"}
{"source": " Your sound will come out through your speakers as intended"}
{"source": " Since I use this as my main mic, I left it as default in the Sound settings"}
{"source": "Overall, for the price, this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs"}
{"source": " I know there are better options but they are also more expensive and I'm on a budget"}
{"source": " It's a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money"}
{"source": " If you're like me and a single person doing YouTube video voice overs or podcasts, this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person"}
{"source": " Worth every penny as long as it lasts"}
{"source": " I'll update when/if it breaks down but until then, I do not regret this purchase"}
{"source": "This mixer is awesome, I couldn't get it where I live, so I bought it on Amazon, it works great!! I plugged my Shure mic, and my acoustic electric guitar to the Line In, and also my ipod to the 2track, and everything works great!! Great sound, with the right parameters, you just have to adjust a little here and there, and it will work great, so far no buzz or humm"}
{"source": "Apple threw a curve at me when, with the new \"thin\" iMac, the company eliminated not only the Superdrive but the 3"}
{"source": "5mm \"Audio In\" port that had been highly useful on previous models, especially for recording computer sounds with a single patch cord"}
{"source": "  After trying a Griffin and Logitech device, I finally found a useful workaround with the Behringer UFO202 interface (there are 2 other very similar models by Behringer--the UCA202 and the UCA222)"}
{"source": " What sets these interfaces apart from the 302USB is a smaller footprint and a permanently-attached, \"dedicated\" USB cord"}
{"source": "  Simply by plugging the USB cord into the USB port on my iMac I was able to record all of the broadcasts, tapes and LPs just as I had done with my old iMac (though monitoring required more cords in back--ugh!)"}
{"source": "For a committed neophyte like me, the UFO202 was probably sufficient"}
{"source": "  I miss the permanently attached USB \"out\" cable and, moreover, am questioning whether I'll ever use the mixing capabilities of the 302USB, which to my eyes has a bit of a \"learning curve"}
{"source": "\"  The problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual"}
{"source": "  Instead of separate sections, the manual uses small, thin font and mixes English with Spanish instructions--a minor but unnecessary inconvenience"}
{"source": " (But give Behringer credit for providing a manual!)I thought I was investing in more versatility (for a modest price increase) than what the Behringer UFO/UCA line of interfaces offered me"}
{"source": "  But a friend tells me that GarageBand has the capability of recording sound-on-sound"}
{"source": "  My present programs (Sound Studio and Toast) can't do it, but if GB can layer 2 or more sound sources, then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better"}
{"source": "  If not, the Behringer UFO202 is not only adequate to serve my needs, but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new iMac's desk space (Apple's elimination of the internal burner gives the company \"thin screen\" bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space--thanks to the new requirement of an external burner)"}
{"source": "Behringer has presented the best solution I've been able to find to Apple's surprising (and dubious) omissions with the latest iMac"}
{"source": "  If your uses include mixing, and if you have the space (we're talking a mere inch or two), the 302USB is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks"}
{"source": "  But if you have a UFO or UCA interface, your needs may already be covered"}
{"source": "I bought the smaller Behringer 302usb mixer for a small home recording setup with a budget target of &#60;$125, but had to move up to this model for and additional cost of about $12 due to the fact that the 302usb doesn't provide adequate phantom power for a Condenser Microphone (not properly disclosed by the company)"}
{"source": " The simple setup I have also includes the Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Hosa XLR cable"}
{"source": "I was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts, interviews, etc"}
{"source": ", over a simple USB headset, without &#34;breaking the bank&#34;"}
{"source": " In addition to the positive reviews on Amazon about most of the Behringer equipment, my son, who has some experience with sound equipment said that Behringer makes solid items, but that I shouldn't expect much in the way of customer service"}
{"source": " He's helped me work on tweaking my setup and he finds the items I bought to be quality as expected"}
{"source": "I'm glad that I moved up to this board, even though it has a lot of features that I won't personally use"}
{"source": " I'm glad that this has two microphone inputs, if I do decided to conduct in person interviews using the board"}
{"source": " Besides the extra mic input, my son will likely put some of the additional features to use recording some music with his electric guitar and making some mixes using the features in GarageBand"}
{"source": "I have found that my son's warning is somewhat correct, at least in regards to information provided for the customer by the company both in the paperwork included in the package and on the website"}
{"source": " Since this is essentially entry level equipment, people like myself, who have little / no direct experience with sound equipment could use a little more guidance in using these projects, particularly in hooking things up to a computer, which is obviously an increasing application"}
{"source": "I couldn't find any information on the Behringer website or in the paperwork which provided guidance for a Mac user, for instance"}
{"source": " In addition, it would be nice if the manufacturer would give some basic information on such items as use of headphones for monitoring, etc"}
{"source": " when using with a computer, but they don't"}
{"source": " I've done a lot of experimentation in addition to Googling to figure out how to get things up and run"}
{"source": "So far, I'm getting quality recording results from this board"}
{"source": " I am currently using it with an RCA type cable with the input to my iMac's line-in"}
{"source": " I might ultimately try another adapter for a USB connection or Firewire, but I haven't had the opportunity to research what is possible or which of the three options provide better sound"}
{"source": " Whether I not I investigate will depend upon my needs in the future"}
{"source": "I believe I got excellent value in the equipment quality"}
{"source": " I would give 5 stars, but the manufacturer should provide more information"}
{"source": "PROS:* Small"}
{"source": " Easy to take with you or set on a small shelf"}
{"source": "* If using USB, does not need external power supply"}
{"source": "  Very convenient"}
{"source": "* Easy-to-use, accessible controls"}
{"source": "* Pre-amp power, works well with condenser studio mikes"}
{"source": "* Plug & play with Windows 8"}
{"source": "  Didn't have to install any kind of driver"}
{"source": "* Variety of input options"}
{"source": "  Dual track with low/high volume sliders"}
{"source": "* LEDs make it easy to tell whether in the green or red range"}
{"source": "  Easy to adjust"}
{"source": "* Awesome for those who need a mini-mixer-- and costs the same as a USB-based preamp-only device"}
{"source": "* Free shipping-- gotta like thatCONS:* Only one power setting, 15v"}
{"source": " That may not be enough for some, but works great with my studio mike"}
{"source": "* Line In / USB buttons somewhat confusing, non-intuitive"}
{"source": "  However the manual shows exact settings for computer use"}
{"source": "* As with other low-end Behringer mixers has a bit of a hiss that one has to balance out"}
{"source": "  Can take some fiddling to overcome it"}
{"source": "* It's pretty easy to overpower the computer's input and cause distortion"}
{"source": "  Start the sound levels at zero and slowly bring them up until it sounds good"}
{"source": "NOTES:I purchased this for use with my studio mike, which I hadn't been able to use with my computer due to pre-amp power needs"}
{"source": "  Plugged it in, worked first time, no problems"}
{"source": "This unit is very sensitive"}
{"source": "  If used with a decent mike can pick up background noises from across a room"}
{"source": "  With a bit of tweaking, is fine for studio work"}
{"source": "  I use it for guitar/voice solo live Internet music shows"}
{"source": "Overall, I'm quite pleased with the unit"}
{"source": "  The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it isn't perfect"}
{"source": " but then it's only fifty bucks"}
{"source": "  For the price, overall quality, ease of setup, range, sensitivity and plug-and-play, I don't think one could find a better unit"}
{"source": "  Two thumbs up"}
{"source": "  I don't know how a Pro would rate this"}
{"source": " but I definitely would recommend it to those doing recording on their computer with a studio-quality mike above the quality of the average \"USB microphones\" available on the market"}
{"source": "  You not only get a pre-amp but a duo-channel stereo volume mixer in the deal"}
{"source": "  Hard to beat at that price"}
{"source": "ADDENDUM:  A few days after the initial review-- I just used the device on a live guitar/voice webcast"}
{"source": "  No background hiss, very good, clear sound, crisp, no distortion, excellent transmission"}
{"source": "  Friend recorded a video and the sound was precise and identical to the original performance"}
{"source": "  Quite pleased with this little mixer/preamp"}
{"source": "HINTS AND TIPS:Two good hints on this one:* Another user and I put our heads together and realized one can use a 6-volt lantern battery (or 3 to 4 AA cells), hook them into a USB printer cable and power this via battery"}
{"source": "  It works great and makes this unit PORTABLE"}
{"source": "* There are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the Windows handles sound"}
{"source": " I have found this to be true"}
{"source": " It pretty much takes over your entire sound system"}
{"source": " For some folks this will be fine"}
{"source": " For others, they may not appreciate this"}
{"source": " So what I did was uninstall the drivers, remove it from the computer USB (which seems to defeat the purpose, but wait"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": " and plugged it into one of those new portable-USB power supplies you plug right into the wall (they're available all over for between $5 and $10)"}
{"source": " This powers the system without hooking it into the USB system of your computer"}
{"source": " What this does is allow you to use the functions of the mixer without altering how Windows handles sound, the programs it uses, or causing problems with programs like Audacity"}
{"source": "You then run a LINE IN from your computer speaker output, a LINE OUT to your computer speakers or headphones, and you can still use microphones or whatever else you want"}
{"source": " This is an excellent alternative to using it as a USB device"}
{"source": " You are instead powering it from a USB wall-socket and simply using it as a quality mini-mixer (which function it performs very well)"}
{"source": " That's what I finally did and am still most happy with this device"}
{"source": "In addition by using it in this manner you pretty much eliminate the relevance of what OS you use"}
{"source": " You could use this with Windows, Mac, Linux or pretty much anything, because all you're really doing is setting it up as a mixer using standard line-in / out cables"}
{"source": " Works very well in this capacity"}
{"source": " Gotta love those new external USB power nodes"}
{"source": " : )"}
{"source": "Each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply"}
{"source": "  Want a 5 channel system - buy 5 speakers and run xlr audio to each one"}
{"source": "  No noise or hum"}
{"source": "  Has both trs and xlr inputs - has a knob for gain control on back"}
{"source": "  Most importantly each speaker has an IEC connector for power to JUST that speaker"}
{"source": "  Mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using TRS outputs which copy the XLRs - those go to my Marantz PMD 580 digital recorder w/ 32 GB of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters"}
{"source": "  Speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces"}
{"source": "  There is, however, no mounting point - no captive nuts or such"}
{"source": "You'll need to adopt a philosophy on gain"}
{"source": "  You can crank the speaker gain to 100% and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the -15 to -6 dB0 range"}
{"source": "  It may be a tad loud - in that case you may want to set both speakers to their 12 oclock position which is 50% power approximately"}
{"source": "You could alternately use the mixer to run near 0 dB and turn it way down on the speakers"}
{"source": "  I like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so I turn the volume way down but drive them with -6 dB0 off the mixer"}
{"source": "Having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation"}
{"source": "My **FIRST** nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like other maudio products have"}
{"source": "  I will have to fabricate some protection"}
{"source": "  My second nitpick is i owned the smaller m-audio 4\" monitors where the amps were in the left speaker and the right speaker connected with twin lead speaker wire to the left i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " not true bi amping but smaller spkrs for my mixer"}
{"source": "  The speaker w/ 2amps died at 15 mos after buying it"}
{"source": "  It was not the power supply as being on made the box warm, but the led surround around the vol knob would not light and you could barely hear the audio even with -3dB0 into the trs line in"}
{"source": "  Thats a different cheaper model by maudio but i had to trash it and buy these which are much nicer!I do like this set of speakers"}
{"source": "  From stereo to 5"}
{"source": "1 surround they do the job with differential audio inputs"}
{"source": "  I may get 3 more for 5 ch as i have a sub already"}
{"source": "SOUND QUALITY: The BX5 sounds neutral and balanced"}
{"source": " Compared to similar sized consumer speakers, they are a bit understated and without bass bloat or exaggerated highs (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", teen EQ)"}
{"source": " The even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours"}
{"source": " It also lacks a midrange bump, and sounds a bit recessed or laid-back compared to average earbuds or home speakers"}
{"source": " In fact the BX5 sounds similar to my Sennheiser 580HD headphones, but with less lower bass"}
{"source": " And that's a good thing for mixing as you don't want speakers that add color and/or bumps in the frequency response"}
{"source": "Unlike typical passive stereo speakers, the BX5 is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer, i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", bi-amped"}
{"source": " This design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver"}
{"source": " The downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables, so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editing"}
{"source": "At first the BX5 struck me as underpowered for a 70 watt rating, at least with a signal directly from my Mac Pro"}
{"source": " However, once jacked into the hotter signal from my MOTU Ultralite the true power of the BX5 was revealed"}
{"source": " It was loud and could be painfully so if cranked"}
{"source": "These are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out (your head should form a triangle with the two speakers)"}
{"source": " That diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is MIA"}
{"source": " In fact, unlike most speakers, there is little rearwards projection"}
{"source": " Perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties"}
{"source": " So don't buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use"}
{"source": "I mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings, live and multitrack, so the bass range is perfect for me"}
{"source": " The bass extends down to a clear 60Hz, so plenty ump for drop-D and drop-C tuning"}
{"source": " If you mix bass guitar and kick drum you'll want larger speakers (BX8) or a sub but these are great for guitar"}
{"source": "I'm used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass, mid and highs for different room responses and taste"}
{"source": " Oddly, the PDF instructions show EQ switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers"}
{"source": " I assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure"}
{"source": "RFI RESISTANCE: I'm an inner city dweller and live in a high RFI area"}
{"source": " Cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes"}
{"source": " So one of the major selling points for me was M-Audio's claim of RFI shielding"}
{"source": " Luckily that was no mere marketing jive"}
{"source": " They really are well shielded against RFI"}
{"source": " Not a single wayward drum loop or DJ in my tracks, not even when cranked"}
{"source": " I can't make that claim for prior speakers I've owned"}
{"source": "HEAT: These speakers run on the warm side: the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session"}
{"source": " Not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips"}
{"source": " It has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat"}
{"source": " However I have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions"}
{"source": " I live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up"}
{"source": " Not a deal breaker but it's wise to turn them off when not in use (I use a power strip so I don't have to flip two separate switches)"}
{"source": "CONSTRUCTION: These are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way: the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed Cinema Display and MOTU Ultralite"}
{"source": " Construction appears very good with dense particle board (MDF) cabs, metal back plate (heat sink benefit) and matching plastic front molding around the drivers"}
{"source": " The cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl"}
{"source": " These monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driver"}
{"source": "The bass drivers are Kevlar with rubber surrounds (tougher than foam!) and the tweeters sport silk domes"}
{"source": " No protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors"}
{"source": " So the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick"}
{"source": "CONNECTIONS: Like most studio monitors, the BX5 comes with pro audio style jacks for 1/4 inch phone plug/TRS and XLR"}
{"source": " If you're a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use, be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks, RCA or USB"}
{"source": " So you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters"}
{"source": " If you're an experienced recordist, you should have plenty of these cables laying around but, otherwise, be prepared to reach for your wallet"}
{"source": "One of the things I like about the BX5 is both the TRS and XLR connections are active at the same time, allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches"}
{"source": " I have an Audioengine D1 DAC connected to the TRS/phone input (for iTunes, movies, games, etc"}
{"source": ") while a MOTU Ultralite (for mixing & tracking) is plugged into the XLR connection"}
{"source": "LAST BLURB: Yes, the small Focal speakers I listened to were better sounding and louder than the BX5 but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches"}
{"source": " However, a perfect monitor for a home studio isn't only about a good neutral sound, but also about compactness, appearance and value"}
{"source": " And the BX5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine"}
{"source": "This is a pretty nifty item and it does just what it says very easily"}
{"source": "  Get one of these and you'll soon have guitar picks coming out of your ears"}
{"source": "  My only issue is that a pick punched from, say, an old credit card isn't going to replace my favorite picks"}
{"source": "  It's a great idea, it's executed very well, no issues with the product itself, but I find that it's not incredibly useful to me"}
{"source": "If you're not particularly picky (no pun intended) then one of these will supply you with picks for a lifetime"}
{"source": "I'm a pro musician and music teacher"}
{"source": " These are the original pick punches, by the company from the guy who invented them"}
{"source": " At least that's what it says on his website"}
{"source": " The others are knockoffs"}
{"source": "  They probably all work about the same, and they're all about the same price now, so why not support the dude who invented them"}
{"source": " He's really into making picks, and has some pretty cool ideas and instructions on his website"}
{"source": " I'm pretty crafty, and really like this"}
{"source": " Bummed about rough edges? Buy a fine sanding sponge at any hardware store, sand the edges for a few seconds, and be done with it"}
{"source": " He also sells sheets of plastic from his website, at quite good prices, and ink for stamping them"}
{"source": " I got a cheap rubber stamp made with my URL for about $10 online, and make my own \"business card\" picks now"}
{"source": " I also found some cool sheets of celluloid on eBay, it's not easy to find the right stuff but the picks I make now are just as good as any you would purchase, and the cost is way less for personalized pics anyway"}
{"source": " If you need hundreds or thousands of picks made, well then you're better off ordering them, but I have fun making 10 or 20 of them at a time to hand out to potential students and clients"}
{"source": " Oh yeah, I can still recycle old cards and stuff too, my students like bringing them in and making their own picks as well"}
{"source": " Everybody knows that picks just evaporate when you lose them anyway, what could possibly be greener?"}
{"source": "When I got this I thought it was a cheap toy-like thing, but when I put it on my banjo, it perched on the head and was practically invisible to anybody else, but easy to see when I needed it"}
{"source": "  It's red when out of tune and green when in tune"}
{"source": "  It does have small lines to tell you you are close to being tuned"}
{"source": "  I love it when I am the only one using it"}
{"source": "  Unlike the clamp kind, like the Snark, it's hard to share"}
{"source": "  The clamp seems flimsy and ratchets open and closed and takes a little getting used to, so between my husband and me using it, I'm afraid the thing will break"}
{"source": "  I play the banjo and it fits nicely on the head, but my husband has to find a place at the end of his acoustical guitar for it"}
{"source": "This is a decent to good little tuner, but there are some drawbacks to it"}
{"source": "  Also, I have the otherPlanet Waves Chromatic Headstock Tunerto compare this one to"}
{"source": "  Here are the pros and cons of this tuner as I see them:Pros:- Super compact"}
{"source": "  Virtually invisible from the front of the guitar"}
{"source": "- Adjustable frequency settings"}
{"source": "- Top load battery"}
{"source": "  No need to unclip from the headstock to load in a fresh battery"}
{"source": "Cons:- Awkward in use when not used on a inline six tuning peg headstock"}
{"source": "  I have a Gibson Les Paul and this tuner is awkward to use with it"}
{"source": "- Less gradation in setting than other tuners"}
{"source": "  The gradiation bars are thicker and fewer in number, giving less of a sense of how close you are to a perfect tuning"}
{"source": "Debatable:- Clip mechanism: Not spring loaded"}
{"source": "  This means that this unit is really designed to stay clipped to your guitar"}
{"source": "- One battery: This unit takes only one battery versus two with the other"}
{"source": "When it boils down to it, I prefer my old planet waves tuner"}
{"source": "  It seems more accurate to me with the finer gradations (though both units gave roughly the same results when tuning - using both at the same time) and I like the ability to clip it on and off in a hurry"}
{"source": "  In fact I can easily recommend that tuner, main drawback is that that one eats batteries)This tuner is more catered to Fender-style headstocks for players that plan on leaving the tuner clipped on"}
{"source": "  For those players, bump up this review to 4 or 4 and half stars"}
{"source": "  For others, I highly recommend the other planets waves tuner linked to in this review"}
{"source": "As a musician I'm in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner"}
{"source": "  I got the package of two"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately, the first one died a quick and sudden death"}
{"source": "  A new battery didn't resurrect it"}
{"source": "  I couldn't find the other one, because they're small and black"}
{"source": "  I finally did find it, and have used it several weeks on my Guild Acoustic, and it works nicely so far"}
{"source": " In fact, it works really nice"}
{"source": "  If you are concerned about stage appearance, this is virtually invisible to anyone watching or videotaping the gig, a plus because it's pretty small but big enough to read"}
{"source": "  At the cheap price, it wasn't worth my time to try returning the first one"}
{"source": "  I just decided to eat the loss"}
{"source": "  I'm crossing my  fingers hoping this one will last"}
{"source": "  If you are playing a really nice, (collectible) guitar, be cautious because these tuners, (and capos too,) can damage the finish permanently"}
{"source": " I use a tuner on my Gibson Johnny Smith while I play but always take it off when I'm done playing"}
{"source": "The NS Mini chromatic headstock tuner quickly recognized twelve pitches across a multi-octave range of electric bass, guitar and mandolin"}
{"source": " The accidentals appear as sharps or flats toggled using the alternate functions of the frequency button"}
{"source": "The tuner's view window is slightly larger than a Chiclet but brightness and resolution are fine for dimly-lit spaces"}
{"source": "  One thing that's less than ideal is the charcoal color of the tuner itself"}
{"source": " If you've ever dropped stuff on dark stages you know what I mean"}
{"source": " I'd wager the back of most headstocks skew to lighter tones than darker, so if discretion is what the manufacturer is emphasizing, a lighter color may work better"}
{"source": "The notes appear red when out of tune; their color changes to green as a `rough marker'"}
{"source": "  You then continue fine tuning using the vertical bars that appear on both sides of the note"}
{"source": "  They've gone to lengths to make the tuner stage-friendly, but I'd much prefer the green color mean ` fine tuned and done'"}
{"source": "  That way I can look from a distance"}
{"source": " I should only have to bother with the bars if I'm struggling to home in (and in my experience that's the exception rather than the rule and usually caused by: new strings, slack under the bridge pins, a slipping tuner, etc"}
{"source": "  Mid-life strings tend to stretch and loosen predictably, so long as you don't use a lot of altered tunings"}
{"source": "The NS is designed to be clipped discretely to your instrument headstock and viewed from the back"}
{"source": " I'm a lefty and, unlike some other tuners, I appreciate the swiveling base that allows me to view the screen right-side up"}
{"source": "The viewer doesn't extend far above the headstock surface and felt a bit cramped on my L4 with large New Yorker-style tuners"}
{"source": "  On headstocks with more bare wood like a Strat, or even my A-style mandolin, it was easier to find a comfortable spot for viewing that didn't obstruct my hand while turning keys"}
{"source": "At first I didn't like the ratchet clamp that attaches to the headstock"}
{"source": " I could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like I needed two to remove it: one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out"}
{"source": " After a little practice, however, I found this wasn't the case and the touch required isn't difficult at all"}
{"source": "The tuner's constructed in a high-impact composite, similar to those parachute-style clamps you see on backpacks"}
{"source": " It feels durable and very unlikely to break, although I didn't try stomping on it"}
{"source": "I was impressed the battery comes uninstalled in a separate small bag"}
{"source": "  The battery door has a concave slot for easy opening with a pick or a coin"}
{"source": " The tuner has an auto-shutoff function to preserve battery life"}
{"source": "The power and frequency buttons are just nibs really; I'd prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them"}
{"source": " The tuner can be calibrated in integer steps from 430 to 450 if 440 doesn't work for you"}
{"source": "One advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and aren't limited to (usually) diatonic open strings"}
{"source": "  For myself, I only use tuners to set the pitch of one string, usually the low A for guitar or bass and low G for mandolin"}
{"source": " In my opinion, tuning a fretted instrument completely by open strings is only slightly better than tuning it completely with harmonics - and neither does the job well"}
{"source": " Intonation is subject to a bunch of variables: string action and thickness, neck relief, fret condition, nut and bridge condition"}
{"source": "Once I have a single string to pitch I match fretted and open string unisons and octaves"}
{"source": " After a while you learn which combination works best for each instrument"}
{"source": "I used to love staring at those Pignose-sized 'strob-a-tuners' sitting on amps and never faulted a musician who took their time to tune accurately (I wish many more did)"}
{"source": " I'm not quite sure how we went from, 'We tune because we care' to 'I'm so embarrassed to be standing here tuning I hope no one notices', but the NS Mini Headstock tuner - questionable design choices and all - does what it says with a minimum of fuss"}
{"source": "I have another headstock tuner that I've had for awhile"}
{"source": "  This Planet Waves PW is about the half the size and works just as well"}
{"source": "  The clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky, but the tuner works like a champ"}
{"source": "  Nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions"}
{"source": "  Compared to my other tuner, it's rigt on the money"}
{"source": "  The other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room, I don't have to take the tuner off"}
{"source": "This little tuner is sweet! I put it on my strat-style guitar and it works brilliantly"}
{"source": " Agree with another reviewer in that it would probably not work well on my Les Paul or Acoustics, but for the 6-in line guitars it's perfect"}
{"source": " It is very precise and accurate, leading you to perfect tuning every use"}
{"source": " I totally recommend this product - you won't be dissappointed"}
{"source": "Ok, this is great for many reasons as most review will tell you and I have had no problems"}
{"source": "  Cons: Minor one would be, that when mounted, the face of the tuner doesn't exactly face your eyes, you have to move your guitar a bit to aim it towards you"}
{"source": " But the biggest CON is"}
{"source": " it's pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig"}
{"source": " In sunlight, its TOO dim! ha ha!  At home or at a night gig its fine"}
{"source": " Daylight? Forget it"}
{"source": "Compared to the SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner"}
{"source": " The Snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag"}
{"source": " This works much better in that regard"}
{"source": " This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions"}
{"source": " It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine"}
{"source": "  Tuning accuracy? Hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really"}
{"source": " I prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the Snark"}
{"source": " They are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument"}
{"source": " But this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig"}
{"source": "The negatives, and why I can't recommend it are as follows"}
{"source": " The battery cover on mine fits very loosely"}
{"source": " I worry the battery will fall out very easily"}
{"source": " I may end up gluing it in place"}
{"source": " It isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up I think)"}
{"source": "  The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways"}
{"source": "  On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which string I'm plucking or tuning, but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it"}
{"source": " It wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow"}
{"source": " I just can't for the life of me work out why they designed it this way"}
{"source": "First, I've noticed that many reviews here are for the \"original\" NS tuner, the one with only two buttons and \"coin slot\" battery cover"}
{"source": " This one is a little smaller, has a metronome flasher, and the battery installs differently, but the name/model evidently didn't change"}
{"source": "  I compared this new one, the \"original\", and the latest Snark on dreadnought guitar, mandolin, and 5-string banjo"}
{"source": "Pros: Size, size, and SIZE!!Reasonably accurateMounting clip better than beforeGood priceMetronome flasher maybe for some?Cons:  Display not as bright as othersContrary to their description, this one seems less sensitive than original"}
{"source": "Battery compartment difficult to openMay not fit well on some headstocks"}
{"source": " On my wife's A style mandolin it fits but barely"}
{"source": " On my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits"}
{"source": "  That being said, I haven't found anything I can't use it on"}
{"source": "My take"}
{"source": " The Snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy, lock in speed, and visibility however I really dislike the \"eyeball on a stick\" form factor and refuse to use it on stage!  I like the fact that the NS is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument, I even in leave 'em on in the case"}
{"source": " The display and lock in speed of the original NS was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me"}
{"source": " I'll keep the new NS tuners for now and hope that D'Adarrio (or someone) improves on it with a better processor and LED"}
{"source": "I've been playing guitar more than 35 years and have used a lot of electronic tuners"}
{"source": "  The first was slightly larger than a paperback book and cost what a cheap guitar sells for today"}
{"source": "  But it was a godsend tuning up backstage while another band was playing"}
{"source": "  Over the years tuners have gotten smaller, cheaper, and easier to use"}
{"source": "  The Planet Waves PW-CT-12 is my new favorite"}
{"source": "It is very small - a little bit larger than a grape"}
{"source": "  Despite some of the other reviews I have used it with good results on a Strat, Tele, Les Paul, and ES-335 electrics and on acoustics from Martin, Gibson, National Resophonic, and Voyage Air"}
{"source": "  I clamp it on the headstock between the nut and the low-E tuner"}
{"source": "  I didn't expect it but it is out of the way enough to leave on while playing"}
{"source": "  Previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock"}
{"source": "  Small and accurate but to use it behind the headstock I have to read it upside down"}
{"source": "  The PW-CT-12 is nicely out of the way even when I play an F chord with my thumb on the low E string"}
{"source": "  It's so light I don't notice it's there"}
{"source": "The display is bright and easy to see in most light"}
{"source": "  A bit hard to read in direct sunlight but I do my best to avoid playing without shade anyway"}
{"source": "  The display is small - a dime can cover most of it - but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position"}
{"source": "  The '#' sharp symbol is small but once you are familiar with the display you recognize it"}
{"source": "  (No flat symbol"}
{"source": "  Bb is displayed as A#"}
{"source": ")  The tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer"}
{"source": "  The display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning"}
{"source": "  It's red until you get close then green with a bar on each side when you are in tune (for example, |E|)"}
{"source": "  I found it to be stable enough to be easy to use for quick tune ups between songs"}
{"source": "These are inexpensive and intended to be discrete so the clamp is small and thin"}
{"source": "  Rough handling will probably break it"}
{"source": "  I notice that the clamp is easily removed so I'm guessing Planet Waves may sell replacements"}
{"source": "  The clamp was not intuitive the first time but the instructions do cover it"}
{"source": "  It is a ratchet rather than a clamp"}
{"source": "  You press a small tab and gently pull the clamp out then push it down on the guitar neck"}
{"source": "  For this reason this is not a tuner to pass around"}
{"source": "  It's meant to be left on an instrument"}
{"source": "  (It's small enough that you can leave it on in the case"}
{"source": ")  If you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better (and larger) choices"}
{"source": "  It can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget"}
{"source": "  I'm going to buy a couple more to leave on my most frequently used guitars"}
{"source": "Other reviewers commented on accuracy"}
{"source": "  If you want strobe accuracy there are better choices"}
{"source": "  For that kind of accuracy you also need a larger display"}
{"source": "  This tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary"}
{"source": "  I haven't had a problem except with guitars that have built-in intonation problems (like old Nationals) and they need tweaking even after a Peterson Strobe"}
{"source": "Soapbox: especially if you are a new player, do yourself a favor and learn to tune your guitar by ear!  Try tuning the strings to a reference pitch or each other then use the tuner to check"}
{"source": "  Learning to tune by ear will help you in more ways than I have time to list"}
{"source": "  Being able to hear the intervals in a chord and know which string is off is an invaluable skill"}
{"source": "  People that can only tune with a tuner will take much longer to develop that, if ever"}
{"source": "The device itself is difficult to read in bright light"}
{"source": "My first one arrived not working at all"}
{"source": "The second one arrived with a low battery"}
{"source": " What? After three days the battery goes out"}
{"source": "I would have returned it, but lost it because it doesn't adhere to the headstock very well"}
{"source": " You've been warned"}
{"source": "I tried this after I lost my planet waves ns design mini tuner"}
{"source": " Not sure if I lost it at a gig, or my three-year-old son got his hands on it, I'd bet the latter"}
{"source": "This micro tuner is smaller and lessobtrusive than the mini, which is nice"}
{"source": " That's about the only Pro"}
{"source": " There are a few other features I guess, like being able to select the instrument used, but I don't need that"}
{"source": "Cons: The readout is smaller, duh, but does not seem to be as bright"}
{"source": " I play a lot of outdoor weddings, in bright sun, and this one is much harder to read than the mini"}
{"source": "This micro tuner does not seem to tune as responsively as the mini"}
{"source": " As you move closer to In tune, the bars do not smoothly move towards the center, so it's easy to over or under tune, and can take a few more seconds then the mini to get the job done"}
{"source": " And those seconds can count when a bride is waiting for you to play her song to walk down the aisle and you're trying to get your tuning absolutely perfect"}
{"source": " I'm also trying to tune my semi-acoustic guitar as quietly as possible, so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option"}
{"source": "Does it get the job done? Yes"}
{"source": " But there is a product that's almost the same size that works a little better, for a negligible price difference"}
{"source": " It might even be cheaper"}
{"source": " If you're a beginner and want to select the instrument you're tuning and a few extra seconds isn't an issue, or you play in dark environments and don't need a super bright readout, this will be fine, but I will be going with the mini when I buy a new one"}
{"source": "Update:  We received a replacement for this item"}
{"source": " It does everything it was advertised to do, and it performs quite well, although the clip on the new one doesn't grip as well as the first"}
{"source": "  The device tunes within 6/10ths cent as compared to a stroboscopic piano tuner"}
{"source": " Our thanks to D'Addario for their assistance in satisfying this customer!Please check our reviews"}
{"source": "  We review regularly, and rarely have anything poor to say about products"}
{"source": "Unfortunately, we cannot remain positive with this device"}
{"source": "  Our small band keeps an average of 8 instrument tuners at the ready"}
{"source": "  We have several NS1 models that work flawlessly, as well as TG-200 models that we really like"}
{"source": "This one seems to consume coin-cell batteries at an unacceptable rate"}
{"source": "  On average, it 'eats' a battery a day"}
{"source": "  It also has a much darker display, making it hard to read unless the stage is quite dark"}
{"source": "  One would think that if the display were darker, less power would be drawn from the battery"}
{"source": "  Average room lighting is too bright to use this tuner"}
{"source": "We do like the ability to rotate the display, so that the tuner can be mounted in front or behind the headstock, with the display maintaining proper orientation"}
{"source": " Unfortunately the poor performance means that this unit will find its way into the junk-drawer on the workbench"}
{"source": "I'll be upfront and honest right away and say that I'm not the biggest fan of headstock tuners"}
{"source": "  I love the idea, but usually I feel the execution leaves a bit to be desired"}
{"source": "  But when this popped up on my Vine newsletter I thought I'd give it a go and see if this one fixed any of the things I don't like about the other ones (*COUGH*snark*COUGH*)"}
{"source": "A little background first, I guess"}
{"source": "  I've been playing guitar for the last 9 years, and I currently have two other tuners"}
{"source": "  I have a little Korg plug in type,  where you can have it pick up your signal with an instrument cable or just use the microphone on the front to tune up"}
{"source": "  I also have a Boss TU-3 pedal tuner"}
{"source": "  If I'm jamming with friends or playing a show, the TU-3 is what I'll use to stay in tune"}
{"source": "  Its very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal, so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience"}
{"source": "  For home practice I use the Korg, as I usually tune up before I start playing, then just plug into my practice amp and blast away"}
{"source": "  The Korg is nice and accurate, easy enough to use for alternate tunings, and in 9 years of having it around (including in and out of jam sessions before buying the TU-3) I've only had to buy one replacement"}
{"source": "I first saw a headstock tuner a year ago when a friend went to get an electronic tuner and the guy at the guitar store talked him into that blue Snark that everyone seems to have these days"}
{"source": "  He was not incredibly pleased with it"}
{"source": "  Not only was it somewhat garish to have a big blue ball sitting on your headstock, it seemed kinda flimsy to me and it wasn't exatly easy to tune up with it"}
{"source": "  While I thought the idea of having a tuner that worked off the resonation of your guitar would be cool, it seemed like the design had a bit of a ways to go before it was something I'd want on my headstock"}
{"source": "Enter this Mini Headstock Tuner by Planet Waves"}
{"source": "  Does it fix the problems that made the Snark so unappealing to my friend and me?1"}
{"source": "  Accuracy:  It does seem to tune accurately, that's a good thing, and it already puts this ahead of the Snark"}
{"source": "  Its not easy to use for alternate tunings however, so do keep that in mind"}
{"source": "  Also, the letters take some getting used to, as they use that kind of chunky LCD block style that you find on some DVD players"}
{"source": "  Not a huge complaint, but it isn't as idiot proof as my Korg or TU-3"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": "  Looks/Ease Of Use:  It's quite a bit more subtle than the Snark, able to hide behind your headstock, which is quite preferable to having a blue ball sitting on the end of your guitar"}
{"source": "  The only problem with it hiding behind the back of your headstock is if you have a Les Paul style headstock where you have three tuners on each side, you may have trouble finding a spot where the tuner actually fits and can be seen"}
{"source": "  My LP copy has the larger Grover tuners so my only choice is on the very end of the headstock"}
{"source": "  I wear my guitar fairly low, so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down, but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck"}
{"source": "  Those with Fender style headstocks should have no problem, though, it'll work great for them"}
{"source": "  Also, it is plenty bright, so seeing it well enough is not going to be an issue"}
{"source": "3"}
{"source": "  Durability:  This is where the main drawback to these types of tuners are"}
{"source": "  The Snark is very easy to break, as it rests on a small ball joint"}
{"source": "  This Planet Waves mini isn't going to lose its head too easy, but the ratcheting clip is made of plastic and I don't expect it to hold up under too much use"}
{"source": "  The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too, so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy enough to break"}
{"source": "  I haven't had it long enough for this to happen yet, so I can only give you my initial impressions"}
{"source": "  Let's just say this, I'd never gig with this guy as my only tuner"}
{"source": "  Its obviously not going to be rugged enough for that type of use"}
{"source": "All in all, it is a better headstock choice than the Snark"}
{"source": "  However, headstock tuners as a whole still have a ways to go before they're gonna work for everyone"}
{"source": "  Anyone who gigs often would be better off getting some kind of pedal tuner (I personally suggest a Boss TU-2 or TU-3 or a Korg Pitchblack)"}
{"source": "  I know they're more expensive, but you'll be happier off in the long run"}
{"source": "  Those looking for a convenient way to tune up between songs during a jam session, this is a nice option"}
{"source": "  But it may not hold up forever"}
{"source": "I'll probably stick to my TU-3 and my Korg plug in, but as headstock tuners go, this is nicer than most"}
{"source": "After years of having a large, awkward tuner I was thrilled to learn about this modest little clip on"}
{"source": " So much more discreet to do a little last minute tune up when you're already on the stage"}
{"source": "I love that the lights are bright and easy to see, unlike one previous tuner I had that was very hard to read"}
{"source": " Dark grey letters on a light grey screen"}
{"source": " Even better is that the light colors are different for flat, sharp and on-tune which makes it even easier"}
{"source": " May not seem like a big deal when you're tuning alone at your house, but when you're on a stage with other people doing a lot of last minute adjustments and your attention is all over the place, those little details really help"}
{"source": "The only real drawback I see in the design is that there is no place on the head of my 6 string acoustic where I can conveniently clip this without it being somewhat in the way of the tuning knobs"}
{"source": " Not impossible, but not terribly convenient, either"}
{"source": " It was seemingly designed with an electric style in mind where the knobs are more often in one straight line than on either side of the guitar head"}
{"source": "The $80 tuner I bought 20 years ago is a Sabine, and quite frankly, 20 years later it still works as well as it did when I bought it"}
{"source": " In fact, the price has come down and I bought another one to keep in a different guitar case"}
{"source": " Now that I have this one I still use the Sabine more at home, but like this one better on stage because it's low profile"}
{"source": " Looks more professional and I like that"}
{"source": "This unit is very small and tucks away nicely"}
{"source": "  It is easy to use"}
{"source": "  I do wish they would make the bracket a little stronger but it works well"}
{"source": "  I would recommend this to anyone"}
{"source": "  Very Nice!!"}
{"source": "Item came with two sets of screws, a long set and a shorter set"}
{"source": " Looks good on my Yamaha acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " Holds my strap well"}
{"source": " I am happy I bought this"}
{"source": "I must first state for the record, I hate strap locks"}
{"source": " Hate may be a bit shy of the mark, actually"}
{"source": " I've never met a set I liked in any single way"}
{"source": "  I've only ever dropped an instrument that HAD strap locks on it"}
{"source": " In fact, EVERY instrument I've owned with strap locks has suffered a gravity attack caused by the very device intended to prevent such misfortune"}
{"source": " Schaller type strap locks tend to come unscrewed- even with Locktite"}
{"source": " When you install them, you are compressing the nut and washer against a compressible material (leather, nylon, etc), so it is never really tight"}
{"source": " Plus there's only about two threads on the slim little nut, and if they aren't a really tight match to the other half, wear very quickly (especially since you have to tighten them so often)"}
{"source": " Duncan type often suffer from 'non-positive lock syndrome' if not regularly cleaned and lubed"}
{"source": " Then there's the fact that unless all of your instruments are equipped with the same brand of lock buttons, your strap is only compatible with the ones which match"}
{"source": " And then there is the the metal-on-metal clankyness"}
{"source": " Yuck"}
{"source": " Oh, and and the cost"}
{"source": " Moving on"}
{"source": "Why are these little Elliptical End Pins so brilliant? They are NOT strap locks"}
{"source": " If you orient the widest points horizontally when you install them - as you should, then in order to put your strap on and take it off, you will need to turn the strap 90 degrees to the instrument"}
{"source": " This isn't something you are likely to do inadvertently while reaching for your beer onstage"}
{"source": " Sometimes the simplest design is the best design"}
{"source": " And they're pretty, too"}
{"source": "Downsides? I will say the screws supplied with these are pretty short, but then I would also argue there is no reason to not use the screws holding in the original strap buttons as long as they fit tightly"}
{"source": " If they don't, using smaller or shorter screws is not the answer- especially considering if the screws cut new threads, you're pretty much- uh, screwed"}
{"source": " The washers these come with are pretty small too, so I just used the screws and felt washers that came with the factory buttons"}
{"source": " With a brand new strap, they can be a bit tricky to get on, but just as tricky to get off (which is good)"}
{"source": " That tight fit could cause some increased wear on the strap, especially if it is made from cheap materials"}
{"source": " With older straps, just as with any traditional strap button, you need to develop a good habit of always checking the positive seat of the strap, but it is very easy to verify, and again much less likely to slip than a traditional button"}
{"source": " Mechanical strap locks actually require just as much diligence to ensure they are still securely fastened and working properly"}
{"source": " But with strap locks, if there's a problem, you'll have to grab some tools to fix it - or replace it entirely"}
{"source": " Talk about a false sense of security"}
{"source": " With PE's Elliptical End Pins, you just put the strap where it should be and you're set"}
{"source": "If you are one who is taken to doing back-flips, or find yourself frequently using your strapped instrument like a hula-hoop onstage, then these probably won't save your precious instrument from the gravity goblin or inertia monkey's worst intentions"}
{"source": " But if either of these antics are your norm, you might be better served by a permanently attached strap, or perhaps therapy"}
{"source": "Since writing the review above, I've ordered several more sets to use on all of my basses"}
{"source": " I'm done with traditional strap buttons and don't imagine ever going back to metal on metal strap locks"}
{"source": "It works and cleans the strings, but its durability is a little low, for about 2 months"}
{"source": " I recommend Planet Waves String Cleaner if you plan to use a really good cleaner"}
{"source": "This has been a very good purchase, I have not stopped using it since I got it, good and prompt service as well Thanks again Cheers !!!"}
{"source": "Used on my acoustic guitar"}
{"source": "Pro:Removes friction for faster playing"}
{"source": " I noticed immediate result after applying first time"}
{"source": "Enhances string life and tone"}
{"source": " Strings sound brighter now"}
{"source": " I guess there was some mild crud buildup you can't see"}
{"source": "Reduces finger noise"}
{"source": " Not completely gone but lessened"}
{"source": "Easy to use applicator"}
{"source": " Wide applicator makes it easy to put on and not get it onto the fret board"}
{"source": "Con:Packaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks"}
{"source": " Has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesn't prevent dry out"}
{"source": "I don't believe I would buy again until a sealed container is provided"}
{"source": "I have tried many string cleaners and so far this one is as good as any"}
{"source": "  I like the applicator, and will just need to see how long it lasts"}
{"source": "this pickup for the price is just as good as one that cost 4 tom 5 times as muchif your looking for one that wont break your bank but sounds good this is the one"}
{"source": "This is great for anyone who wants to turn their acoustical guitar to electric"}
{"source": "  I did find out there may be a little feed back from the amp if you get too close"}
{"source": "I had just bought an electric acoustic and while I was ordering that I just went ahead and picked one of these up as well because I figured what the heck it's under $20 and maybe my full size acoustic might work well with it"}
{"source": " So I got it and th only thing I had an issue with is that it slide around a little too easily, but, it does work well"}
{"source": " I recommend it for those who are looking for a simple solution to making their acoustic, electric so that they can play it through their amp"}
{"source": "Very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound"}
{"source": "Very high gain,fits in all size soundholes"}
{"source": "Good heavy construction"}
{"source": "Of course it's not great"}
{"source": "I'm not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself"}
{"source": "If you have a Taylor, Martin or Gibson that's not already AE this is not for you & I probably didn't even need to say that!!I just have a cheep Rogue that sounds good with this pickup"}
{"source": "It's just a matter of how much you want to (or can) spend"}
{"source": "I'm happy with this pickup!!Joe"}
{"source": "I've used my HDE pickup for about a month now"}
{"source": " I use it with a Fender Frontman amp"}
{"source": " The sound quality is as good as pickups of twice the cost"}
{"source": " I highly recommend this product"}
{"source": " I'll probably get a second one for a backup, while I can get it at the present price"}
{"source": "About ten years ago, I installed strap locks on my first guitar (Fender Stratocaster)"}
{"source": " They worked well and were easy to install"}
{"source": " I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks on many other guitars with mixed results: the screws are really small and they would some times get stuck in the middle of installation"}
{"source": " I had to drill additional holes no two guitars (Gibson SGs)"}
{"source": " Ouch"}
{"source": "This made me take a second look at Schaller"}
{"source": " The components, beginning with the screws, are of much higher quality than Dunlop"}
{"source": " It took me ten years to realize that I made the wrong choice"}
{"source": " I should have gone with Schaller from the beginning"}
{"source": " I have replaced all my strap locks with Schaller with excellent results"}
{"source": "I just bought a Rickenbacker 4003 that came with Schaller strap locks pre-installed"}
{"source": "  I've used Dunlops before, but those would require redrilling the holes to put them on the bass, so I just bought the Schaller buttons"}
{"source": "  I don't quite like their look as well as the large round Dunlops, but there's no question about the quality -- these are not going to fall off the bass anytime soon"}
{"source": "Just got it, so far so good"}
{"source": " I use delay pretty light n tight - slapback vibe, not too wet"}
{"source": " This does it well"}
{"source": " I considered the MXR delay - no - I may have considered it but the only pedal failure I've ever experienced was my MXR/Dunlop Phase 90, first the DC input, then the stomp switch, after light/barely any bedroom use"}
{"source": " This ModTone here, seems solidly constructed"}
{"source": " I haven't played with it too much yet, but as of right now, I wouldn't recommend it for Edge wannabes, seems limited in that regard"}
{"source": " I may be wrong, but either way, do we need more Edge wannabes?No, we do not"}
{"source": "Good tone though, does the trick, trick"}
{"source": "Bought this pick looking for options around the old \"dropped pick\" syndrome"}
{"source": " I was skeptical, as the pick at first glance seems slicker than most"}
{"source": " However, once between thumb and index finger, these darlings hang on!"}
{"source": "I have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus"}
{"source": " I have several bad habits, including a tendency to need to grip the pick too tightly or I drop it at some point"}
{"source": " On a bit of a lark I bought a pack of the Clayton BeeHolds (0"}
{"source": "5mm,) and really like them"}
{"source": " The hexagonal hole really does make them stay in place with much less grip required, and I find the hole to be in a very natural-feeling spot"}
{"source": " The pick is fairly long, but I have not had any accuracy problems with them, and so far durability has been good"}
{"source": "I still use other picks too, but I really like these and can't imagine not keeping an ample supply on hand"}
{"source": "It is well made and is very safe unless a drunk drummer knocks over your stand"}
{"source": " I would prefer more tilt, but it serves the purpose"}
{"source": " It's Also harder to use your iPad without holding it and having an arm rest"}
{"source": " Very durable and light weight"}
{"source": " If I had to do it over again, I would use a music stand instead"}
{"source": " Someday I may use it on stage"}
{"source": " It's made in Germany, so it could be taken into battle"}
{"source": "This Review is for the (JOYO CRUNCH DISTORTION)  I have a few OD's including a OCD, a fuzz and a modded Rat but thought for $30 bucks from Crazy Cart this might be a cool distortion pedal"}
{"source": " And it is"}
{"source": " It's very articulate and gives you good Marshally 70s/80s crunch"}
{"source": " Cleans up nice with the guitars volume and retains your guitars sound"}
{"source": " It's almost OD-ish in it's responsiveness"}
{"source": " It's not super heavy distortion though"}
{"source": " I'm a blues/classic rock guy and it'll do fine for heavy, classic rock distortion but it's not a modern metal pedal"}
{"source": " For the price its amazing"}
{"source": " I really love it"}
{"source": " I'm so impressed with this pedal that I've ordered the Sweet Baby and will probably get a couple of others while they're still cheap"}
{"source": "This is supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box"}
{"source": "  I can not comment on this as I have never played this pedal"}
{"source": "  What I can say however with 30 years playing experience is that this is a very good pedal"}
{"source": "  When one takes into account the price it is a great pedal"}
{"source": "  I own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo"}
{"source": "  This has the most distortion"}
{"source": "  It has a nice ragged edge to it and is great for classic to hard rock"}
{"source": "  It does have a bit of noise at high gain but much less than the boss stuff I have had experience with"}
{"source": " It is solidly built and apprears road worthy"}
{"source": "  great pedal and great value"}
{"source": " I would have no hesitation buying this or any other joyo product"}
{"source": "This Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion pedal is just amazing! My son has become a fairly decent guitar player over the past year and is moving beyond the basics, so was thrilled to get his hands on this distortion pedal"}
{"source": " It was great to hear him play \"Iron Man\" through this pedal, it made a huge difference"}
{"source": "The pedal produces a rich sound that has a nice sustain and tweaks easily with the three adjustment knobs (Gain, Volume, and Tone)"}
{"source": " This is also a very solidly constructed pedal that will hold up well to a lot of abuse"}
{"source": " At the loudest settings there is a bit of \"hiss\", but it is easy to find where it starts and dial it back a bit"}
{"source": "Highly Recommended!CFHEvaluation unit provided by manufacturer"}
{"source": "not bla bla bla, this joyo pedals are the best, any you get"}
{"source": " that's it! thank u joyo im your number 1 customer"}
{"source": "Good:  Plenty of gain on hand"}
{"source": "  Lots of sustain!This thing can get really loud"}
{"source": "  It gives yourinexpensive tube amp that Marshall crunch"}
{"source": "Built well, it's casing is made out of metal, not plastic"}
{"source": "Inexpensive but performs and sounds just as well asboutique boxes costing 3 times as much"}
{"source": "  If you're lookingfor your first cheap distortion pedal, forget the Boss DS-1 andget this one!  Well worth the money"}
{"source": "Bad:  Adds a little noise & hiss specially to single coils (strats & teles)"}
{"source": "You might need to use a noise gate to tame the noise"}
{"source": "Quieter with humbuckers but hums when I use it with my Xotic EP Booster whichI always keep on"}
{"source": "  It doesn't happen when I boost my overdrives (OCD & Hardwire CM-2)"}
{"source": "If you move farther away from your amp, the hum disappears butyou can still hear some noise"}
{"source": "  I guess this is typical for distortion boxes"}
{"source": "No need to boost it though, it already has that thick & big sound to start with"}
{"source": "It didn't come with a 9V battery as shipped, not a big deal 'cause I use a poweradapter anyway"}
{"source": "A bought this pedal to see how such a cheap stomp box could get such great reviews"}
{"source": "  Plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see"}
{"source": "  It has tons of gain on tap, it responds well to the guitars volume knob, it creates a wall of overdriven amp tonal love"}
{"source": "The pedal cuts through and is articulate"}
{"source": "  It's not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock"}
{"source": "  Think AC/DC and Van Halen to Metallica"}
{"source": "  It's a classic rock pedal that screams!!!Buy it"}
{"source": "According to the ad copy, this pedal \"replicates Full-Stack Marshall crunch"}
{"source": "\"As the other reviewers will testify, it does indeed do just that"}
{"source": "What I'm loving about this pedal is that it really is very amp like"}
{"source": "  Dial back the volume on your guitar and it cleans up"}
{"source": "  Its responsive to your picking attack, its distortion is very very harmonically rich, and it does give you a Marshall type sound, good boost in the mids and bass, giving your tone the sonic density that those amps are famous for"}
{"source": "Sad to say, it actually does the full-stack thing better than my ProCo Rat, which has for years been my favorite distortion pedal"}
{"source": "  The Rat is fantastic and I have no plans to sell mine, don't get me wrong, but the Crunch Distortion can get the raging full-stack tones the Rat can, but has a tighter bottom end, less noise, and a more open sound than the Rat"}
{"source": "  Individual notes ring out great on the Crunch Distortion"}
{"source": "  Its a great pedal period"}
{"source": "  Its a darn guitar miracle at $40"}
{"source": "As a side point, I play lots of Ramones stuff and this pedal, more than any other, gives me that awesome Johnny Ramone tone"}
{"source": "  I was running my gold-top with P-90's into this pedal, then into the sparkling clean '65 twin reverb setting on my Fender Mustang II (this pedal plays well with modeling amps, which is a rarity, let me tell you) and with some tweaking I was getting a FANTASTIC Ramones tone, better than I've ever got with my Rat, my Boss DS-1, DS-2, HM-2, ANYTHING else I've owned (and I've owned over 2 dozen other dirt boxes over the years)"}
{"source": "  This is the pedal that finally did it, it just nails that cranked 70's Marshall stack sound"}
{"source": "My hat's off to Joyo"}
{"source": "  They made a fantastic distortion, one of the very best I've ever played, and they're practically giving it away"}
{"source": "  Buy one, you'll use it, you'll love it, you'll be happy you bought it"}
{"source": "I've reviewed several Joyo pedals now and have loved almost all of them"}
{"source": "not just because of the price ($40 to $50), but also because of their (apparent) durability and tone quality that would be appreciated at any price"}
{"source": "  But ultimately, I decided that this is somewhere between a 4* and 5* review, and I just can't give it the 5* review I've given the other Joyo products I've tried out thus far"}
{"source": "* Extremely high output and high sustain *When I first plugged this thing in, I had it set up similar to any other distortion pedal I would try out with my Les Paul and VOX combo amp - with the dials all at 12 o'clock (50%)"}
{"source": "  Big mistake"}
{"source": "  This pedal has an EXTREMELY high output"}
{"source": "  Depending on the Gain setting, I was achieving output parity with the clean signal with the Volume set at around 25%"}
{"source": "  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and it's certainly better than having no headroom to set the pedal louder (a frequent criticism of the BOSS DS-1), but it's something to be aware of"}
{"source": "Also, I read several comments here that this \"isn't a high gain distortion\""}
{"source": "  I couldn't disagree more"}
{"source": "  This thing has TONS of gain"}
{"source": "  I think people are thrown off by two things: (1) The name, which pays tribute to the MI Audio Crunchbox it clones; and (2) The clarity/transparency of the tone, particularly the higher-end range, that shines through at all Gain levels"}
{"source": "  \"Crunch\", in my mind, refers to a punchy, cleanish tone that has just a little bit of breakup in its character"}
{"source": "  The Crunch Distortion has a tone that doesn't really breakup or get \"fizzy\" as you turn up the Gain, but that's not what \"Gain\" really is"}
{"source": "  The Gain knob increases the saturation and sustain of the note(s), but I think people are fooled by the fact that the sound doesn't crack up"}
{"source": "  Hit a barre chord and see how long the note holds with the gain turned up"}
{"source": "  This actually makes the pedal very useful for lead work, also, which is one of the JF-03's strengths"}
{"source": "* The setup is weird, but workable *Because of everything I described above, you may use some weird dial configurations to get the tone you want"}
{"source": "  My level is usually around 25% to 40%, and is still very loud"}
{"source": "  The \"crunchy\" classic rock tone that other reviewers talked about does exist, but only at around 5% to 15% of the gain setting"}
{"source": "  And I had the tone knob generally working from 9 o' clock to 12 o'clock, as it got a little too bright to go any higher"}
{"source": "  (Again, this is with Les Paul humbuckers"}
{"source": ")  Ultimately, what I decided was that this pedal has enough bass, not too much in the midrange, and very distinct high end frequencies that come through very clearly"}
{"source": "  If you play gigs and are having trouble cutting through the other instruments, I'd imagine this pedal would do the trick!* It's costs less than half of many of it's true \"competitors\" *While the affordability aspect is distinct from \"quality\", it cannot be ignored"}
{"source": "  Part of my initial disappointment was based on a side-by-side comparison with my MXR '78 Custom Badass Distortion"}
{"source": "  The latter did have a fuller sound to it, and was arguably better for rhythm work"}
{"source": "  But that's an $80 custom shop pedal from MXR"}
{"source": "  Try comparing this pedal to a $40 Boss DS-1 or MXR Distortion + and it blows them out of the water (in my opinion)"}
{"source": "  I'm not sure want to roll with the Crunch Distortion being the only dirt box on my board, but if you used it with a specific purpose in mind (like a lead/gain boost), you could afford this and Joyo's excellent \"Ultimate Drive\" overdrive pedal for still less than most boutique or even BOSS distortion pedals go for"}
{"source": "UPDATE - About a week into owning this pedal, I did revise this score from a 5* to a 4* rating"}
{"source": "  If you graded the pedal in a \"vacuum\", I could absolutely see a 5* rating for the $40 price tag"}

{"source": "  Please note also (which I didn't realize before) that the internal trim pot for \"presence\" is NOT easily accessible unless you are prepared to remove the circuit board and the three jacks that are connected to it"}

{"source": " I know tone, and have had great, and not so great gear"}

{"source": " Versatile"}
{"source": " Smooth"}
{"source": " Easy to dial in"}
{"source": " What's not to like here? Forget your \"boutique\" pedals and save tons of money and get a great pedal"}
{"source": "I really liked this one"}
{"source": "  I bought the Crunch Distortion at the same time and these are complimentary to each other as well as nice standalone"}
{"source": "  I very much like how Joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just cannot afford to spend thousands on these overpriced \"boutique\" pedals"}
{"source": "  I will continue to buy these products from Joyo until I find something wrong with them and at present I have nothing to bitch about at all here"}
{"source": "  Sound wise this is a big phat heavy sound"}

{"source": "Let's get a few things straight from the start - I love effects pedals"}
{"source": "  I love the idea of a handcrafted boutique pedal (and have owned a few), and I'll also play the mass-produced BOSS and Ibanez stuff"}
{"source": "  And if you put foreign/no-name brand in front of me, but the pedal is made well and sounds GOOD, I'll play that too"}
{"source": "  All you need to know is that this pedal is well-constructed and sounds darn good for 40 dollars"}
{"source": "Joyo is a Chinese company that essentially has makes their own form factor (a heavy-duty metal box with an MXR-like button switcher), and then clones/mimics/copies circuitry of popular boutique pedals that cost anywhere from $100 to $250"}
{"source": "  And they've figured out how to ship them to the U"}
{"source": "S"}
{"source": " and sell them for $40 to $60 each"}
{"source": "  I've recently discovered these pedals, and if money/pedalboard space were no issue, there's probably 8 to 12 of them I'd like to own"}
{"source": "The \"star\" of the Joyo lineup, however, is arguably the JF-02 Ultimate Drive"}
{"source": "  This pedal got some notoriety a few years back when an American company bought them in bulk, repainted them, and tried to sell them for almost $200"}
{"source": "  The fact that they thought they could get that much for it tells you something about the quality"}
{"source": "The pedal this is supposedly clone off of is the Fulltone OCD Overdrive, a boutique pedal that came out several years ago, and usually sells from around $150"}
{"source": "  I own that pedal, and I've done a side by side comparison on my pedal board"}
{"source": "  And while tone is EXTREMELY subjective, I'm not sure that I wouldn't go with the Joyo Ultimate Drive in a blind test"}
{"source": "  While the 3-knob, Lo/Hi switch are clearly inspired by the Fulltone OCD, the pedals actually sound quite different"}
{"source": "  With the exact same settings, the Fulltone will actually sound much brighter"}
{"source": "  That's really saying something because the Fulltone is known as having a very well-rounded tone with a defined base"}
{"source": "  Well, the Ultimate Drive offers even more bass and mids, yet the Tone knob can brighten it up quite a bit without losing that bottom end"}
{"source": "It's actually extremely versatile"}
{"source": "  I'm not sure that it would do low-gain \"crunch\" sounds very well, but if that's what you want, consider the Joyo Vintage Overdrive, the Joyo Crunch Distortion, or a Tubescreamer"}
{"source": "  Right now, I have three pedals that are fairly similar and offer a great \"overdriven Marshall\" tone: The Fulltone, the Ultimate Drive, and the Marshall GV-2 Guv'nor"}
{"source": "  While they are all great pedals, the Joyo really hits the sweet spot on my Vox Combo amp (using a Gibson Les Paul)"}
{"source": "As for soloing/lead play, I'm noticing all types of pick attack/harmonic response with the Joyo that I don't get with other stompboxes"}
{"source": "  It really does act and feel like an onboard overdrive channel"}
{"source": "  If you point all the knobs at 12 o' clock, some people may think it is muddy, but that Tone knob really does change the character quite a bit"}
{"source": "  Sorry for the long rant, but I want people to know that just because you can't afford $150+ on a single pedal doesn't mean you can't enjoy a great overdrive stomp box"}
{"source": "  Check the JF-02 out - it just might be your \"gateway drug\" to other Joyo pedals!"}
{"source": "Until today"}
{"source": "  I do not own the Fulltone pedal that this product was designed to replicate, but you can search YouTube and see several comparisons and there is no audible difference"}
{"source": "  Aside from that, this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit"}
{"source": "  It's not a \"metal\" type distortion, but it nicely covers everything else"}
{"source": "  I play an Ibanez Artcore through a Vox AC15 in a Christian band and set with just a small amount of drive, at about the 9:00 position, this pedal does not add color to your signal and the sound of your amp shines through nicely"}
{"source": "  That's the whole point - the reason we choose a certain amp is because we like the way it sounds, so when we push it with an overdrive pedal we don't want it to change the sound of the amp, we simply want to kick it in the rump a little"}
{"source": "  Or a lot"}
{"source": "  And the Ultimate Drive does it nicely"}
{"source": "  The drive could best be described as somewhat gritty and smooth at the same time, like sand in a smoothie"}
{"source": "  Driven hard it gives plenty of nice harmonic overtones"}
{"source": "  But I think it sounds best with just a small amount of kick, right into a tube amp"}
{"source": "  I'm not exactly bringing home tons of money, so it's nice to see that there are pedals designed to give great tone to even tightwads like myself"}
{"source": "  The only thing that I could consider to be a downside is the stupid graphic of Satan, Darth Maul, Gene Simmons, or whatever that thing is that's painted on the metal case"}
{"source": "  Other than that, if you're in the market for a \"boutique-style\" overdrive at about 1/3 the cost, you've found it"}
{"source": " ONE FINAL NOTE: One unexpected benefit of this pedal is that the overdrive does wonders with a single-coil strat"}
{"source": "  Really"}
{"source": "  It gives it a nice fat crunch while somehow retaining the strat tone"}
{"source": "  I can't think of any other pedals I've owned that could do this"}
{"source": "  SECOND FINAL NOTE:  I'm almost embarrassed to admit this, but I also played it through a cheap solid state Fender Frontman 25R and it sounded great even through that piece of rubbish"}
{"source": "  As a Christian musician, I can say that this may not exactly qualify as a miracle, but it's pretty close"}
{"source": "This thing sounds amazing- except for one small problem: At higher gain settings it hisses like a mother"}
{"source": " I'm not talking about extreme settings, just gain and &#34;character&#34; (thats what Tech 21calls it- forgot what Joyo calls it) at 3 o'clock"}
{"source": " It has a beautiful WARM singing lead tone-better than any pedal that I have owned ( and that's probably 20-30 distortion/overdrive pedals) If only it didn't hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal"}
{"source": " If you have a Rocktron Hush or other noise gate pedal, it is worth considering"}
{"source": " The Joyo is an EXACT clone of the Tech 21British pedal, which costs $189 (?)"}
{"source": " I don't know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not"}
{"source": "I bought this with the idea I was getting a pedal that would give me usable Marshall amp sounds"}
{"source": " After trying for a couple of hours, I find that it won't do that"}
{"source": " I guess my combination of guitar and amplifier wasn't meant to be used with this pedal"}
{"source": " The guy who mentioned in the reviews about the sound getting thinner as you turn up the voice control, he was spot on about that (very annoying effect)"}
{"source": " Nothing but praise goes to the supplier ( KDM Distributors) "}
{"source": " They did a fine job getting the pedal to me across the country"}
{"source": " But the pedal itself, not for me"}
{"source": "This one is easy - buy it! I've owned many effects over 32yrs playing "}
{"source": " "}
{"source": " "}
{"source": " some ok, some didn't last 48 hours, others never parted with - this one fits in that category"}
{"source": " Gives excellent range of Marshall emulated sounds"}
{"source": "been playing over 50 yearsowned it all 3 or 4 times :)pedals out the wazoothis is the cats meow if you want a marshall in a boxset your amp up cleanspend 5 minutes finding the sweet spotplay till your fingers hurt"}
{"source": "i own the tech 21 britishdid a side by sidecan hear NO differencei dialed in the early VH brown sound in minutesand thats where i left itcleans up with the vol knobresponds well to pick attackdo not hesitate, this pedal is a winner"}
{"source": "I revised a previous 4-star review after playing with the Joyo British some more and especially after using it for direct line-in recording"}
{"source": "  I now rate it at 5 stars"}
{"source": "The phrase \"Marshall in a box\" gets thrown around a lot, but usually the people using it have a particular Marshall amp in mind"}
{"source": "  For example, the Wampler Plexi-Drive sounds like an older Plexi, while a MI Audio Crunch Box will do that 80's JCM compressed high gain tone"}
{"source": "  On the recommendations of several people, I picked up the Joyo British Sound hoping it could clone the full spectrum of those different amps"}
{"source": "Does the British Sound succeed at that goal?  Yes and no"}
{"source": "  On certain settings, the British Sound does offer a convincing, tube-like sound reminiscent of a Marshall cabinet"}
{"source": "  You can clean it up quite a bit, and it works very well as a \"foundation\" pedal, placed last in your effects chain to give the amp Marshall \"character\", but boosted by other overdrive and distortion pedals"}
{"source": "(Note: The pedal is actually its own preamp, so the recommended use of it is to plug it directly into the power amp section of a combo amp, or into a PA system or mixer directly"}
{"source": "  You can use it in  the effects chain into another preamp, but that will diminish its effectiveness)But despite those good traits, there's just a few things \"off\" about it"}
{"source": "  First, it seems to add quite a bit more noise (\"hiss\") than some of the other Joyo Sound pedals"}
{"source": "  Or perhaps it's just more noticeable due to the fact that this is supposed to be a \"Marshall\", so i turned it up"}
{"source": "  Second, as several other reviewers noted, the Voice control seems exactly backwards of what it should be - turning clockwise makes it sound thinner"}
{"source": "  On the other three Joyo Sound pedals, the opposite is true"}
{"source": "  Functionally, this really should mean nothing, but it does make it a bit more confusing to dial in"}
{"source": "If you read the manual for the Tech21 British (upon which this pedal is supposedly cloned), they claim that 9:00 on the Voice/Character knob would be JTM/Bluesbreaker territory, 12:00 would be Plexi, and anything above that gives you the \"presence boost of a 70's Metalface\""}
{"source": "  I haven't tried all those amps, but perhaps it's meant to brighten up as you turn it up, and that's just a design choice"}
{"source": "I think it's possible to get the \"Marshall\" tone you want out of this thing, but you have to work the EQ knobs with each adjustment of the Voice knob"}
{"source": "  At this price, hard to complain too much"}
{"source": "For a cheap pedal I gave this a try"}
{"source": "  Very versitle"}
{"source": "  Can get many different types of sounds and drive from it"}
{"source": "  The knobs are a little tight, but that just makes feel tough I guess"}
{"source": "  I like much more than the Joyo fuzz"}
{"source": "  THis can give some cleans and drive to distortion"}
{"source": "  You really need to work with it a bit with your amp and find that sweet spot"}
{"source": "Certainly not the best overdrive, distortion, or effects pedal I have used"}
{"source": "  But for the budget I do receomend it"}
{"source": "  It is cheap and very has a good range of tone options"}
{"source": "  I ran it into a Fender Camp 600 and they seemed to get along well"}
{"source": "Hope this helps"}
{"source": "Well built"}
{"source": "Not plastic or cheaply constructed like some pedals out"}
{"source": "Has a good selection tones and voicing knobs really does a lot to effect sound"}
{"source": "Simple to use"}
{"source": " Great variety of uses for it"}
{"source": " I like the layout of controls as well"}
{"source": "Only bad point for me is the location of the adapter input it's on the right side,I'd prefer it to be on the top end like my other pedals"}
{"source": " Other then that nothing I'd change"}
{"source": " Loyal Joyo pedal user"}
{"source": " They've got a great product for the price point"}
{"source": "JF-15:again, OMFG! The MK type sounds take awhile to get, so tweak & consider your amp settings, guitar type, etc)"}
{"source": " The other pedals like it in the series I'm intrigued by, but I can get any sound I want so far with my stuff"}
{"source": " I tried both the Joyo JF-02 Ultimate Drive OCD clone pedals individually on Strats, an LP, & a Harrington, through my slightly modded VC5212(Webber speakers)tube amp; clean channel"}
{"source": " As with any pedal, it won't make you a better player"}
{"source": " Only practicing, gear research & use, and your hands' touch/grip(whatever you kids call it these days)will have the final say of what comes out of the amp"}
{"source": " I intentionally got the JF-02 after reading positive reviews all over the net"}
{"source": " The JF-15 was a curiosity purchase"}
{"source": " I was able to dial in sounds of Anthrax, Stryper, stratty Buddy Guy blues(remember he uses a metal finger tip clip at times-works with Pickboy metal picks), the 'dad friendly' radio rock sounds of Nickelback, Daughtry; Foo Fighters"}
{"source": "to get your Marshall sounds takes a bit of work, but I use their Blues Breaker II reissue, Reflector and sometimes the crushing JackHammer(a BBII with more options and gain)"}
{"source": " I also use a digitech valve Hardwire for vintage 70's rock or switched to 'saturation' and mid scooped for the Pantera sounds"}
{"source": " So, in closing, this pedal can do a lot to change the character of your amp to a Boogieish sound if you know what you're doing for the sound your leaning to"}
{"source": "I was very anxious to get this pedal in the mail and try it out so that I could write a review of my own"}
{"source": "  The reviews on all Joyo products are extremely polarizing"}
{"source": "  Some people love them and think they're every bit as good as boutique pedals costing three times as much, while other people (including a significant portion of the hardcore techie community) despise the whole concept and wish they didn't exist"}
{"source": "  Having tried out this specific product - the Joyo JF-15 California - I can tell you that I'm extremely impressed for only having spent $40 to $50"}
{"source": "First, a word about Joyo"}
{"source": "  Joyo is a Chinese company, which for a lot of people loyal to American products, starts them off on the wrong foot"}
{"source": "  Further adding to the controversy is the fact that many Joyo pedals appear to have virtually copied the circuitry of well-known Western boutique pedals, such as the Fulltone OCD (\"Joyo Ultimate Drive\"), Ibanez Tubescreamer (\"Joyo Vintage Overdrive\"), and MI Audio Crunchbox (\"Joyo Crunch Distortion\")"}
{"source": "  If you find that disturbing or appalling, I won't try to change your mind, but consider the following:  Joyo has found a way to manufacture surprisingly faithful \"clones\" of these very successful pedals at a price that even entry-level casual players can afford"}
{"source": "  Larger companies, such as BOSS, DigiTech, and Ibanez, openly copy ideas, clone sounds, or borrow inspiration from other successful pedals"}
{"source": "  Finally, if you want to pay more the boutique pedal, nobody is stopping you from doing that"}
{"source": "  There are certainly areas where Joyo cuts costs by using cheaper materials, and the Joyo is absolutely not a one-for-one clone"}
{"source": "  My personal opinion is that if Joyo has found a way to take the concepts of these pedals and make them cheaper"}
{"source": "power to them"}
{"source": "  But again, reasonable minds can differ"}
{"source": "  My primary concern is: \"How does the pedal SOUND?\"The answer to that question is \"surprisingly good\"!  The specific pedal \"cloned\" by the Joyo California (from what I'm told) is the Tech 21 NYC \"Character\" series, which was a pedal series (apparently now discontinued) that modeled popular amps, such as Marshall, Fender, VOX, and Mesa Boogie"}
{"source": "  Like the Tech 21 pedal, there are 6 on-board knobs, including one called \"Voice\", which essentially a transparency control - the more you turn it up, the less is sounds like your original amp, and the more it sounds like a Mesa Boogie"}
{"source": "  There is also a 3-band EQ (Low, Mid, High), which seems to do a pretty good job crafting your tone"}
{"source": "  Finally, there are Level and Gain knobs that work as if they were the corresponding knobs on your amp"}
{"source": "  Fortunately, I find with the level gain at 12 'o clock, the volume is basically on par with your original signal"}
{"source": "Trying to describe the tone in writing is difficult, and is obviously going to vary a great deal depending on your guitar, amp, and other cables and effects"}
{"source": "  I run a Gibson Les Paul through a small VOX Valvetronix combo, and the resulting tone was good"}
{"source": "  Most importantly, it sounded very different than the normal tones I would get through that amp"}
{"source": "  Admittedly, I do not have much experience with using an actual Mesa Boogie amplifier, but I think people get a little too wrapped up in making that direct comparison anyway"}
{"source": "  Obviously, if want the true sound of a Mesa Boogie half stack, you're going to have to go buy the real equipment"}
{"source": "  But the tone that I found with this pedal was very full-bodied, yet still retaining clarity on the high strings"}
{"source": "  The \"Drive\" knob works better at the lower and mid-level gains - it is capable of higher gains, though I did find the pedal to become somewhat noisy with the Drive knob past 3 'o clock"}
{"source": "There are two ways to think of this pedal"}
{"source": "  First, you could use it as an \"always on\" amp modeler if you really like the tone it produces"}
{"source": "  In that case, you could turn the \"Voice\" up and keep the \"Drive\" low, while adding other distortion pedals effects to that base sound"}
{"source": "  Second, you could think of it strictly as a \"distortion/overdrive\" pedal, and turn it on only for parts of songs where you want that effect"}
{"source": "  However, one very nice (and very \"amp-like\") feature of the overdriven tone provided by this pedal is that the tone cleans up very nicely when you turn the volume down on your guitar"}
{"source": "On a final note, the build quality on the Joyo California \"out of the box\" looks to be fantastic"}
{"source": "  The switch is a \"click\" metal button similar to those used on MXR pedals"}
{"source": "  There is a back cover for a 9V battery, or there is a well-placed DC 9V adapter jack, which works with standard 9V adapters such as BOSS and OneSpot"}
{"source": "  Sorry for the length of the review, but I wanted to provide some good information based on my experiences, since I struggled to find honest reviews while I was doing research"}
{"source": "  I can't promise everyone will like it, but considering the poor quality of the $40 pedals I used to buy from DOD, Danelectro, and Ibanez SoundTank growing up, it's pretty hard to regret giving the Joyo California a serious look at that same price"}
{"source": "  Enjoy!"}
{"source": "Wow, I am very surprised by this pedal"}
{"source": " I got it with the intention of going aft that chimey AC30 tone, which it does a decent job at"}
{"source": " I didn't realize everything else this pedal can do"}
{"source": " You can get a very heavily distorted full on rock crunch out of it no problem"}
{"source": " Metal, no problem, crystal clear and punchy, no problem, super crispy tele twang, no problem"}
{"source": "I tried it on bass and was REALLY impressed"}
{"source": " It is eerily similar in function to my SANSAMP VT BASS pedal and gets a lovely SVT type sound quite easily with loads of bottom end"}
{"source": " I even threw it in my bass effects chain to use as an added OD/Crunch in front of both my head/cab as well as VT BASS and PARA DRIVER"}
{"source": " Works like a charm"}
{"source": "Turn the VOICE control to go from smooth and thumpy to gritty and crunchy, while adding a bit of mid range response"}
{"source": "I only wish this had a balanced XLR out in addition to the normal 1/4&#34; out"}
{"source": " Phantom Power would be nice then also"}
{"source": "I would easily use this in a live setting running straight to the board, though a speaker sim afterwards would really top it off nicely and help to smooth out frequency spike here and there"}
{"source": "  I have been thinking of trying the Joyo DI wit speaker simulation for this purpose, but I just haven't gotten around to buying it yet"}
{"source": "In my opinion you should at least check this thing out, I mean its $40"}
{"source": "I bought this pedal to use in a min rig as an experiment and I love it"}
{"source": "  I use the pedal as a preamp going into a PA or poweramp"}
{"source": "  The pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind"}
{"source": "  I use a classic box clean tone with a little bit of bite"}
{"source": "  It is quite responsive to the volume knob on the guitar"}
{"source": "  I have a VFE Alpha Dog and an MXR Custom Badass OD before the pedal"}
{"source": " After the pedal I use an MXR phase and Flanger, VFE Blueprint Delay and then a Byang Triverb"}
{"source": "  When all is said and done my tone is phenomenal and no one can tell when I am not going through a more traditional amp rig"}
{"source": "  Buy the pedal, it's great!"}
{"source": "I'm going this stompbox as I always do, based on the quality of the pedal and what it does - not necessarily whether than tone is \"useful\" for my particular setup"}
{"source": "  Viewed in that objective light, the Joyo JF-13 AC Tone is an excellent pedal for $40 to $45"}
{"source": "There are two ways to think of the JF-13 and the other \"Tech 21 clones\" in this line (California, American, British Sound, etc"}
{"source": ")"}
{"source": "  The first is the obvious one, which is to use it as a stomp box at the end of you signal chain"}
{"source": "  This box basically takes your guitar input and any other effects you add and then tries to \"clone\" a VOX AC30 amplifier into the speaker"}
{"source": "  How effectively it does this really depends on your settings and the quality of the amplifier it self"}
{"source": "  At the end of the day, if your amplifier (particularly the budget, solid state ones) has certain limitations that you don't like (too bright, not loud enough, too muddy, breaks up too easily"}
{"source": "), no pedal (including a $200 boutique one) is going to fully overcome those deficiencies"}
{"source": "But the second way to think of the JF-13 is as a preamp, where the output would go directly into a recording device, PA system, computer, or tablet"}
{"source": "  I don't have enough experience trying that (though I did a little bit with the Joyo California) to say how well that works, but I've heard great examples of it online"}
{"source": "  Also, having the convenience of amp-like controls (with 6 knobs) is certainly very convenient if you like to play/record in that manner"}
{"source": "As for the sound of the pedal, it's very good"}
{"source": "  I've heard complaints about the pedal being noisy if you turn the gain all the way up, but I wouldn't let that concern you"}
{"source": "  That's true of virtually any distortion/overdrive pedal, it can be cleaned up with a noise gate/suppressor, and I think the better use of this pedal is on the low- and mid-gain settings anyway"}
{"source": "  The \"Drive\" knob is like the gain knob on an overdriven tube amp"}
{"source": "  It's a very nice tone, responds well to picking, and cleans up well if you reduce guitar volume (which many pedal distortions do not do)"}
{"source": "  The \"Voice\" knob is hard to describe"}
{"source": "  Basically, it morphs the tone into something deeper and \"punchier\" as you turn it up"}
{"source": "  But that also changes the impact of all your other settings, including drive, EQ, and level"}
{"source": "If I had one complaint about this pedal (even compared to the California, also a very cool pedal), I was a little surprised how much this pedal \"wants to be dirty\""}
{"source": "  It's tough for me to envision leaving it on all the time if it overdrives so easily"}
{"source": "  But, again, I think part of that is you're basically running through two preamps if you play it through a combo"}
{"source": "  Check out some of the YouTube recordings as to how it sounds directly into a speaker or recorder - it could be completely different in that context"}
{"source": "  At any rate, it's a very intriguing device at only $40, and I could see finding new uses for it in the future I haven't envisioned yet"}
{"source": "UPDATE (April 2013): I actually sold this pedal, instantly regretted it, and then bought it back"}
{"source": "  Now that I understand how to use it properly (by bypassing the preamp of my combo amp, through the effects loop), I am able to get some great sounding clean tones out of the pedal"}
{"source": "  It really is an excellent value, either as a \"foundation pedal\" or as an emergency tool for musicians who might end up somewhere they need to plug directly into a PA/Speaker system"}
{"source": "  I won't be letting the AC Tone go this time :)"}
{"source": "Let me start by saying"}
{"source": " I used to work for Line 6, so I know modeling pedals!I have nearly every modeling pedal Line 6 makes,but I was looking to minimize the rig that I take with me to the bistro-size gigs that I play most of the time"}
{"source": " In general, all I really want is the Vox AC30 tone and maybe a delay pedal or some other single effect"}
{"source": " I use a very small ZT Lunchbox amp for this sort of thing and it's solid state, so you basically get a nice loud straight ahead tone, which is nice, but makes our cover tunes a little less 'authentic' sounding"}
{"source": " I heard some sound samples online comparing this pedal to the Tech21 Liverpool pedal and to my ear"}
{"source": "there wasn't a $150 difference"}
{"source": " Very convincing and just $40! I pair this up with a Line 6 M9 and I can get most any tone I need for Beatles, Tom Petty and all of the 60's 70's tones I need"}
{"source": " Love this pedal!"}
{"source": "You won't get AC tone from this because your tone is subjective because you are running through another amp head"}
{"source": "  but if you are a tone hound and bored with same sound of same amp, this is an excellent product lifting the voice of your Amp"}
{"source": "  Sorta like buying a Wah, flanger or other product, this essentially will provide another venue to push out tone"}
{"source": "  Problem is is that you won't replicate a Vox sound found on a classic rock album, because what you are producing is a unique sound"}
{"source": "  I have yet to try this through a loop"}
{"source": "I bought two of these"}
{"source": " Small but well lighted screen"}
{"source": " Very quick reaction to string"}
{"source": " I liked it from the very first tuning"}
{"source": " It is quicker and more responsive than other tuners I have that cost twice the price"}
{"source": " It is small and doesn't look like a huge lump on the headstock"}
{"source": "  Operates with one 3V 2032 Battery, included"}
{"source": " I plan on buying a few more for other guitar cases and as gifts for my musician friends around birthdays and X-mas"}
{"source": "This is my first electric tuner"}
{"source": "  As a percussionist-turned-bass-player, I goofed off, stick twirled and snored through countless hours of tuning in band class over the years"}
{"source": " Not surprisingly, I kind of laughed at my own peril when it came time to tune my new instrument"}
{"source": "  I grabbed this particular model because it was inexpensive and positively reviewed"}
{"source": "  It does the trick"}
{"source": "  It's small, accurate enough to get by with general practice (I can correct minor tuning issues by ear)"}
{"source": "  However, now that I have been using it for a few months, I have noticed that it does not give a very stable reading of pitch"}
{"source": "  For example, if I go through and tune all the strings it will read a hair high/low on the next pass, and yet again on a third pass"}
{"source": " If you need something &#34;no-fuss&#34; and accurate the first time around to the spot, you might want to invest in something a little more robust"}
{"source": "  But, for standard/practice tuning, this is a fine accessory"}
{"source": "This little guy worked just as advertised"}
{"source": " It's a tremendous tuner for gigging or practice when you forget your tuner or dont' feel like bringing it"}
{"source": " It won't work the best for getting intonation right, but it hits regular tuning perfectly"}
{"source": " Super easy to use and a must-have for anybody who gigs out"}
{"source": "There are some more compact units out there (like planet waves), and the intellitouch PT10 is a little clearer to read, but this baby is great for the price"}
{"source": " I leave it on my Strat while I play as it can be easily turned on/off as needed and stays relatively hidden behind the head stock"}
{"source": " The back lighting is clear enough and the tuner is as accurate as my foot switch tuner"}
{"source": " Overall, great deal for the price"}
{"source": "this is the most ergonomic tuner there is it functions well it is sturdy and it fits in ur pocket! count on fender to give u a good product!"}
{"source": "Wow, the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry, but plug in some real mics and voila- the DR-40 becomes something special"}
{"source": " But, I do not always want to carry around so much equpment, and was hoping for better internal mics"}
{"source": "Honestly, my super cheap Olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing"}
{"source": "And WHY is the line-out so darn noisy!? Must be defective"}
{"source": " Oh well"}
{"source": " Gonna, have to send this back"}
{"source": "allotoday went to the stores to TEST out the followingtascams"}
{"source": "dr 05,  dr 07 mk2, and dr 40  and, for myself,ended up buying nothing"}
{"source": "their differences for YOUR  ears"}
{"source": "are"}
{"source": "dr 05,  this is a good quality toy"}
{"source": "NO line in"}
{"source": "use its own mic, you will be ok  with this, for meetings, etc"}
{"source": "NOT really that good for  music"}
{"source": "can be done, but NOT as good"}
{"source": "if you use ext mic"}
{"source": "u wont be happy either"}
{"source": "HIGH background HISS noise  relative to all 3"}
{"source": "dr 07etc etc"}
{"source": "only slightly better than 05"}
{"source": "all else same"}
{"source": "dr 40 was MUCH quieter in noise level"}
{"source": "be it"}
{"source": "in mic, ext mic or LINE inquite decent but costs you around 200 dollars"}
{"source": "this can be used to ( semi ) record music too"}
{"source": "so, testing on their own mics"}
{"source": "that last one was far far better than the first two"}
{"source": "for those wantingLINE in"}
{"source": "means only that dr 40"}
{"source": "however,my tests involved  checking  sound QUALITY  of bit more seriousLIVE recordings"}
{"source": "took output from our  zoom r 24 recorder  and  output to the dr 40"}
{"source": "upon comparing the resulting  CDs"}
{"source": "a / mstr ed by the zoom r24 and print to cd,  vs"}
{"source": "b / recorded dr40 printed to cd"}
{"source": "the sound was Obviously better  with  a /no need to buy  any  a/d recorder attempt at this price level ,if one is looking for semi serious  Master recorder"}
{"source": "my budget must be tripled at least"}
{"source": "and then to go out to test some more !no cheap way, is there"}
{"source": "for those curious, the whole idea has come from wanting to connect  2 units of zoom r24,  NOT wanting to use computer software,  taking the 4 outputs from these two into a clean mixer or analog sum box,  and getting them downto  2 channels, and finallly to some mastering digital recorder"}
{"source": "hoping perhaps the tascam ss r100 or r200 MIGHT do the trick,in the tests to come"}
{"source": "many thanks, and may your camels always have two humps !k"}
{"source": "I recently purchased this recorder and have compared it to my older M-Audio Microtrak II"}
{"source": " The Tascam is a much newer design and shows good ergonomic improvement"}
{"source": " The internal mics are adjustable, the interface is easy to use, the battery life is long and the batteries are common AA and easy to replace on location"}
{"source": "I've not tested the external xlr mic preamps but have recorded with the internal mics with absolutely wonder results"}
{"source": " The internal preamp is very quiet, the mics on acoustic grand piano are very dynamic, produce excellent detail and have what appears to be a very wide neutral frequency response"}
{"source": " The recorder produces a very wide and deep soundstage and does outclass my older recorder in every aspect"}
{"source": " To me the price is very reasonable and the build quality is reasonable for the price"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": "I am starting out learning to play guitar"}
{"source": " I wanted a way to record myself playing guitar onto my laptop so I could go back and listen and to also play both lead and rhythm parts and mix them together"}
{"source": "After asking a few questions on a message board, the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 was recommended to me"}
{"source": " It's pricier than some of the options I was considering but given the reviews I figured it was worth taking a chance"}
{"source": "I'm glad I did"}
{"source": " The Scarlett 2i2 is a piece of cake to set up, even for a guy like me that's pretty PC savvy but never dealt with external recording devices"}
{"source": "I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and everything installed flawlessly"}
{"source": " The drivers loaded without a hitch and immediately recognized the Scarlett when I plugged it in"}
{"source": "The included Ableton Live 8 Lite software recognized the unit as well"}
{"source": "I'm looking forward to using the Scarlett more to improve my guitar playing"}
{"source": " So far, I'm very happy with my purchase, even if it was a little more than I initially wanted to spend"}
{"source": "Purchased to provide professional level I/O for recording from mixers etc"}
{"source": "Works very well for that purpose; also and probably especially useful as location recorder with just a laptop and condenser microphone(s)"}
{"source": " The bus powered connection is as simple as it can possibly get, and the package is about the size of a fat paperback book"}
{"source": " Inputs provide for microphone(phantom powered or not), instrument, balanced line on TRS, and balanced line on XLR connector"}
{"source": "Tested with bass and guitar via instrument input also sounded very good indeed, and dead silent"}
{"source": " Output of high quality material also sounds superb "}
{"source": " and compares well with other very high quality gear"}
{"source": " Everything about this unit is a cut above the units from its competitors in this (crowded) price point"}
{"source": "Though lacking lots of the I/O and routing options you get with more expensive units, this device, unlike most other products in this price range, has a quality feel to its enclosure, jacks and controls"}
{"source": " Drives headphones, even inefficient ones, to satisfying levels cleanly"}
{"source": "The input controls have a helpful feature wherein if you have set things too \"hot\" the color changes briefly to red -- helpful to bring your attention to your proper metering (in SW) to adjust your levels"}
{"source": "Re computers and drivers: almost all the tests went well"}
{"source": " On two laptops running Windows 7, installed the latest drivers from the focusrite web site and initial tests of playback and recording went great"}
{"source": " One of these recorded perfectly also"}
{"source": " The other, which has a core 2 duo processor (FWIW), had issues recording properly, and no matter which of the three possible usb drivers were installed, and I tried them all, this problem remained"}
{"source": " So, for certain windows laptops, you may want to hang onto the receipt until you verify proper operation throughout"}
{"source": " This issue is why four starts rather than five"}
{"source": "On a happier note this interface \"instantly worked\", with absolutely no installation, on a linux desktop running ubuntu studio 12"}
{"source": "04 \"precise\""}
{"source": " So for linux users this may be a very attractive option"}
{"source": "Lastly documentation and bundled software is \"light\"; this is fine if you know what you are doing but it would not hurt focusrite to provide a bit more substance in their user guide for novices connecting various types of gear - guidance re best practices etc"}
{"source": "But this is a nit -- overall a superb value provided your computer interfaces happily"}
{"source": "I'll start off by saying that I've had this interface for about 6 months now and it is still going strong"}
{"source": " I think that anyone, especially the beginner, looking for an interface should definitely consider this unit"}
{"source": " Not only does it provide 2 channels, but it also has monitor out and headphone out"}
{"source": " This could also be a decent sound card for those who are fed up with integrated audio"}
{"source": "However, I have a few gripes with the 2i2"}
{"source": " The headphone knob feels a little flimsy and has a bit of give if you push on it"}
{"source": " This is purely the \"feel\" and does not really hinder performance"}
{"source": " But it makes the unit feel cheap, at the controls"}
{"source": " IMO, the knobs and switches can feel a bit unsatisfying when the rest of the unit is built so strongly"}
{"source": " Moving on, while on the topic of knobs, the level knobs for both channels could also use indicators, but once again, aesthetics"}
{"source": "Why 4 stars?The problem must of started happening today because I never noticed it before"}
{"source": " Or it could be just that, maybe I never noticed it"}
{"source": " Anyways, shortly after I engaged the 48v phantom power, the interface started making a barely audible high pitched hissing"}
{"source": " Once again, this is barely audible and should not be a problem if your microphone is far enough away"}
{"source": " I hope that this issue does not show up in all of the Scarlett 2i2 interfaces"}
{"source": " I would think that an interface should produce no noise as it in key in the recording process for many home studios"}
{"source": " Hopefully, just my unit is defective and it isn't something that is common among the 2i2's"}
{"source": "Another thing to note is that while Direct Monitoring is a feature on this unit, the volume levels coming from the direct monitoring is very low and makes it less practical to use"}
{"source": " In other words, I am saying that you would have to essentially turn up the gain and record \"hotter\" and get closer to clipping to effectively hear yourself clearly though the direct monitor"}
{"source": " Nevertheless, it is a feature that can be utilized though"}
{"source": "So in the end, 4/5 stars! The packaging that the interface came in was very minimalistic, but yet appealing, thumbs up for that"}
{"source": " I really like the build quality of the interface and Focusrite makes it very easy to record audio with this unit"}
{"source": " The only issue that I would consider a big problem is the hissing from the phantom power being engaged"}
{"source": " Overall, great entry level interface/sound card!"}
{"source": "This audio interface is fantastic"}
{"source": " It takes a little getting used to, but after an hour you will have it mastered"}
{"source": " The sound quality is great! The direct monitoring is a little quiet, but that is no complaint all things considered"}
{"source": "All in all, if you need a budget system at home: get this"}
{"source": " It is perfect for Mac or Pc"}
{"source": "And sounds crisp"}
{"source": "  I had alesis io2 express which did a similar job"}
{"source": "  But after hearing a subtle difference in a youtube video I finally broke down"}
{"source": "  I heard more definition with the guitar"}
{"source": "  Now that I have it I take the quality for granted"}
{"source": "  It has higher quality and the dials feel solid"}
{"source": "  The little limiter lamp is awesome"}
{"source": "  I'm very happy with it even if my old alesis was doing the job"}
{"source": "  My old Alesis had midi pass through which didn't work anyway so feature for feature this is a better pick even if it's around 40 bucks more"}
{"source": "I'm using this unit to set up a Linux Digital Audio Workstation"}
{"source": " It works out of the box with a recent ubuntu install or linux mint if you prefer"}
{"source": " You will probably want a realtime kernel and use jackd to take full advantage of this device"}
{"source": " Without using a jackd interface or a realtime kernel audacity records 96kHz but skips when duplexed, I mark this up to not having sophisticated controls or realtime enabled"}
{"source": "The following settings are the best I've been able to manage in jackd2 without and xruns on a realtime kernel(using qjackctl) (I'm also no expert)Frames / Period: 128Sample Rate: 96000Periods / Buffer: 3Which gives a predicted latency of 4msWith a 10ft 1/4 inch patch cord (to run jack_iodelay) I got a consistent 8"}
{"source": "24 ms overall latency (not bad imho)"}
{"source": "Without the realtime kernel you should expect xruns with these settings, my computer is a sandy bridge pentium 2"}
{"source": "2ghz with 6gb ram and a ssd"}
{"source": "We have used this with an AT2020, AT2021"}
{"source": " SM58 microphones and the sound quality is quite high"}
{"source": " The preamps deliver what seems like no noise under usual conditions"}
{"source": " Simple two mic recordings of band practices sound outstanding"}
{"source": " I've also tried some higher gain recordings of weird ambient sounds (rain crickets) and still received very little noise from the device itself but can hear everything that happens in the house"}
{"source": "Update:I've found the above setting in jack don't work well for processing live guitar effects in rakarrack"}
{"source": " Here are the best setting I could come up withFrames/Period: 512Sample Rate: 48000Peiods/Buffer: 3RealtimeSoft ModeQjackctl lists the latency of 32ms but I have not tried measuring i with jack_iodelay"}
{"source": " All the included effects of rakarrack work on my computer for these while booted in the (hard) realtime kernel"}
{"source": "I bought this as an interface between my mixer, instruments, and mics to my Macbook for Garageband"}
{"source": "  You have to go in and change the input and output in OSX, but it works great!"}
{"source": "I use this little guy in connection with my DAW and digital piano"}
{"source": "  I run the piano sounds through balanced cables into the line-in ports for recording, and I also run VST intruments on my DAW that I trigger via USB MIDI from the piano and use this device for digital/audio conversion"}
{"source": "  I listen through Sennheser HD 595 headhphones plugged in to this and I also have some studio monitors attached using balanced cables"}
{"source": "I purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface, the Behringer UF0202"}
{"source": "  That device worked quite well for this purpose as well but lacked two things: a volume knob, and balanced in/outs"}
{"source": "  The volume knob thing I could work around, but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops (even with a ground lift plug), so I needed to go with balanced cables"}
{"source": "  I'm glad I did"}
{"source": "  The balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems"}
{"source": "  This was a good purchase"}
{"source": "  However, I would say to anyone who doesn't need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the Behringer"}
{"source": "  It's a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well"}
{"source": "  Further, it's class complaint so you don't have to use Behringer's drivers"}
{"source": "  It's plug-and-play"}
{"source": "I have some good things to say about the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (all about the hardware) and some bad things (all about the software)"}
{"source": "  I've tried using the driver version 2"}
{"source": "1, which came with the disk, and the udpated 2"}
{"source": "2, which I downloaded from Focusrite's website"}
{"source": "To let you know what I need in an interface:1"}
{"source": " Balanced stereo in/out2"}
{"source": " High quality headphone amp3"}
{"source": " Volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line4"}
{"source": " Good digital-to-analog conversion5"}
{"source": " Low output latency (input latency not important to me)I don't use the Mic preamps, which is one of the big selling points of this device"}
{"source": "================ The Good ====================This box is simple and well-designed"}
{"source": "  It does what you want, has very convenient controls, and has high build quality"}
{"source": "  I'm pleased with the digital-to-analog conversion"}
{"source": "  It has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp"}
{"source": "  It has switches so each input can be a line-in or microphone pre-amp"}
{"source": "  It has a switch for zero-latency monitoring (of whatever is coming in)"}
{"source": "* The headphone amp was of particular concern for me"}
{"source": "  I use headphones a lot and a poor headphone amp can be quite a problem"}
{"source": "  The Behringer headphone amp was only ok"}
{"source": "  Specifically, it has an output impedance of 50 ohms"}
{"source": "  The rule of thumb for good headphone/amp matching is that the output impedance should be 1/8 the impedance of the headphones--my hd 595's have 50 ohms of impedance"}
{"source": "  Breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response"}
{"source": "  In my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass"}
{"source": "  Most manufacturers don't list their output impedance, possibly because they are embarrassed"}
{"source": "  Anyway, Focusrite does, which is one reason I trust them a little more"}
{"source": "  The output impedance is less than 10 ohms--respectable but not amazing"}
{"source": "  Still not as low as I would need in principle but I can notice an improvement in the bass response in my headphones"}
{"source": "  There's plenty of extra voltage here too, so I could drive higher impedance cans if necessary"}
{"source": "  Anyway, good headphone amp"}
{"source": "  Check"}
{"source": "* Balanced ins and outs work very well,  The ins accommodates a 1/4 TRS style in and XLR"}
{"source": "  The light around them shows when something's actually coming in and shines red when it's in danger of clipping"}
{"source": "  There's lots of gain available"}
{"source": "  I have them turned all the way down almost"}
{"source": "  The outs are TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and are located on the back"}
{"source": "* I like the look of the box, with a red metal case, and the front and back are sturdy and attractive as well"}
{"source": "* The USB cable is just a type B port"}
{"source": "  This means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever"}
{"source": "  The Behringer, for example, was hard-wired to its cable"}
{"source": "king of annoying"}
{"source": "* It's bus-powered"}
{"source": "  I actually would have been fine with a wall-wart, but this is even more simple"}
{"source": "I really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware"}
{"source": "===================== The Bad =========================The driver for this thing is horrible under Windows XP"}
{"source": "  I have a clean installation with nothing installed except my DAW software, acrobat reader, and this driver"}
{"source": "  I mean, my computer is really stripped down"}
{"source": "  Performance using the Behringer was good"}
{"source": "  The latency (time between playing a note and hearing it out the speakers) was 8 ms using the Behringer, which isn't really perceptible"}
{"source": "Unfortunately the focusrite driver, though it's technically ASIO apparently, doesn't have anything like an acceptable latency"}
{"source": "  The lowest latency I could set it at and get sound out instead of crackles and pops was 23 ms"}
{"source": "  At that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy"}
{"source": "  It's very difficult, at least for me, to work with a large latency like that"}
{"source": "I was ready to return this device when I decided as a last ditch effort to install ASIO4ALL"}
{"source": "  That's sort of an ASIO driver to use if you absolutely cannot make the manufacturer's driver perform at a decent level"}
{"source": "  I installed it and it worked"}
{"source": "  The output latency was a tiny 4"}
{"source": "3 ms (only "}
{"source": "3 of which are actually output latency, so this is REALLY impressive)"}
{"source": "  I conclude that the hardware is very, very good in this machine, but the software is horrible"}
{"source": "Unfortunately, you can't actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn't recognize the device and it never even turns on--it's not class compliant, unlike the Behringer"}
{"source": "  So now I have two drivers for it installed, only one of which I use"}
{"source": "The bad news is that this configuration is very buggy"}
{"source": "  In general when I just turn the computer on and try and play my VST instrument, all I get is crackles and pops until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer"}
{"source": "  The funny thing is that it doesn't matter where the buffer starts out, I always have to increase it before I get any good sounds out"}
{"source": "  I can start it out with a huge buffer--lots of latency--and it will crackle until I open it and increase the buffer yet more"}
{"source": "  I have to do this every time I turn on the computer"}
{"source": "  Also, sometimes if I leave it on for a while and come back, it will be crackly again until I increase it yet another step"}
{"source": " We are talking about major bugs here"}
{"source": "I decided to try ditching ASIO4ALL and trying to make the focusrite drivers work again--maybe there was a setting I was missing"}
{"source": "  As I was trying to set the buffer size, I heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer rebooted"}
{"source": "  When it came back I couldn't get good sounds out, even when I turned the buffer way up"}
{"source": "  Tried rebooting a few more times, still didn't work"}
{"source": "  So I uninstalled and re-installed the focusrite software"}
{"source": "  At first it didn't work"}
{"source": "  I had to install ASIO4ALL as well, and now I can sort of get sounds out of it, half the time"}
{"source": "I hope you are getting the idea"}
{"source": "  These drivers are terrible"}
{"source": "  Awful"}
{"source": "  A monkey could have written a better driver"}
{"source": "  I would give it 1 star if it wasn't for the fact that the device works very, very well when all the stars align and the driver recognizes the drive and allows it to play"}
{"source": "  I guess I'm willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for nice hardware when it works"}
{"source": "  I would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical"}
{"source": "The good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them"}
{"source": "  I'm hoping for that"}
{"source": "  They have already revised the driver once, which is amazing because even the 2"}
{"source": "2 driver is seriously an abomination, just like the 2"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": "================ Closing Thoughts =======================Unfortunately, there really isn't a USB interface that has a good driver"}
{"source": "  The Behringer driver always worked, but if you moved the interface from one USB port to the other, it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver"}
{"source": "  However, you didn't have to use the Behringer driver and ASIO4ALL would give you 11 ms and perform without any complications"}
{"source": "  That's about as trouble free as I've seen in this type of device"}
{"source": "If you read about the Presonus Audiobox USB and the M-Audio Fast Track Pro (probably the two closest competitors to this focusrite), what you get is a bunch of comments just like this one"}
{"source": "horrible, horrible drivers that never get fixed"}
{"source": " Actually Mackie makes a competitor as well, the Onyx Blackjack--but the reviews of that show that the driver is possibly even worse than this one"}
{"source": " Unfortunately none of the pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers, so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time"}
{"source": "  Maybe it's better under mac"}
{"source": "  I don't know"}
{"source": "Interestingly, this is really the only USB 2"}
{"source": "0 device in this range"}
{"source": "  That's quite shocking considering how long the USB 2"}
{"source": "0 standard has been around"}
{"source": "  The only real implication of this is that the USB 1"}
{"source": "1 devices like the M-Audio and Presonus can only do two channel 24/96 audio in OR out, not both at the same time"}
{"source": "  There's not enough throughput in USB 1"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": "So in light of the competition, the Focusrite looks kind of ok"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers--at least in this range of device--think there's no need for good hardware and (especially) good software"}
{"source": "  At least the hardware in this one is up to spec"}
{"source": "  We can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future"}
{"source": "Bottom line: this is a fantastic, 5-star device"}
{"source": "if you can make the software work consistently"}
{"source": "If you are on a tight budget or don't care about balanced in/out, I'd recommend you go with the Behringer UCA202 or UFO2020"}
{"source": "  They are tons cheaper, class complaint, and have better drivers"}
{"source": "  If you use a high impedance headphone with it, even the headphone amp is pretty good on that one"}
{"source": "================ Update May 2012 ==============A new version of the driver, 2"}
{"source": "3, came out since the writing of the above"}
{"source": "  The new driver actually works"}
{"source": "  I have stopped using ASIO4ALL and I get decent latency"}
{"source": "  Once in a while--not too often--it will inexplicably require me to edit the settings and increase the buffer, and some percentage of the time when I do that it will reboot my computer"}
{"source": "  If I don't change anything, most of the time, it works ok"}
{"source": "  I would never use this in a mission-critical setting (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": ", gigging or pro work), but for my home use, it's good enough now"}
{"source": "  If you have issues with the driver, definitely update"}
{"source": "Small amazing good quality interface"}
{"source": " This is not the PreSonus board but the controls are easy set up is quick and it is so portable"}
{"source": " I especially like the dual inputs on front"}
{"source": " Back light on knobs shows clipping on volume (green and red) and connected (green)"}
{"source": "USB powered and plug and play"}
{"source": " My Ableton Suite detected and connected in seconds"}
{"source": "For me being a solo 12 string guitar and vocal act this works just fine for me"}
{"source": " And you get the extra plugs ins supplied by Focusrite too with this interface"}
{"source": " I cannot say I am wild about the included software which is Ableton Live Lite 8"}
{"source": " I really disliked the screen views of Ableton and thought they were hard to view"}
{"source": " So I did some scouting around and talked to a few techs and they suggested Mixcraft 6"}
{"source": " WOW! I like a mixing board that is right up in my face and no guesswork"}
{"source": " Mixcraft 6 is so user friendly and you don't have to bring in a professor from another planet to understand it"}
{"source": " You can be laying down and recording tracks in no time"}
{"source": " And shouldn't recording be fun and not frustrating besides? The Focusrite Interface recognized Mixcraft 6 as if it were an old school bud and the extra plug ins"}
{"source": " So all and all it turned out great and I am a happy camper"}
{"source": " This in my opinion is one of the best entry level Recording Audio Interface units around"}
{"source": " It also has phantom power for those of you who have condenser mikes requiring phantom power"}
{"source": " Dollar for dollar you cannot go wrong with this interface"}

{"source": " (Isn't everything these days?)"}
{"source": "I've used more than a handful of USB/Firewire interfaces over the past decade"}
{"source": " In the past, it's always been a crapshoot, regardless of brand or reputation"}
{"source": " Instability, incompatability, and frustration abound with audio interfaces"}
{"source": " That being said, this has been the best interface I've ever owned"}
{"source": "The size is fantastic, the preamps sound great, it has phantom power, it looks cool, and most importantly, it's been rock solid ever since I installed it two and a half months ago"}
{"source": "I frequently leave my PC on 24 hours a day with this plugged in, and as of yet I haven't had a single crash, dropout, 'pop' etc"}
{"source": " It's performed flawlessly since day one"}
{"source": "Regarding sound quality, my recordings have never sounded better"}
{"source": " I've used this to record electric guitar straight into the unit, acoustic guitar via condenser mics, dynamic mics, hammered dulcimer, cello, synth via direct input, and it handles it all flawlessly"}
{"source": " I'm seriously impressed with the quality"}
{"source": "Finally, it's small enough to take with me when I want to record at a friends house on my laptop"}
{"source": "I've used it with Reaper, Sonar X1, Guitar Rig 5, Cubase LE, all without a hitch, on two PC's - Both Win 7 64-bit"}
{"source": " The drivers gave me no hassle installing, and as I said above, ROCK SOLID"}
{"source": "Your mileage may vary, as I stated earlier audio interfaces can be quite the crap shoot"}
{"source": " Same setup, same hardware, etc, and one person can have wildly differing results"}
{"source": " That being said, I would definitely recommend this unit, as it is my favorite of all time, and I've used everything from crappy firewire mixers to high-end MOTU interfaces"}
{"source": "Great for the price, and if 2-in/2-out works for you, it should perform better than interfaces costing twice as much"}
{"source": " It performs better than my old MOTU 828 mkII that I got for five hundred"}
{"source": "UPDATED 3/16/2014After owning the 2i2 for over a year and encountering many difficulties I am revising my once gleaming review"}
{"source": "The 2i2 is a simple set-up"}
{"source": " Pretty much run your monitors into the line outputs, connect a mic or (apparently) a \"low-headroom\" instrument to it, run the USB cable to your computer and set it up within the DAW described parameters"}
{"source": " It would have been nice to know that the included Plug In Suite is not a stand-alone program, and that it functions in tandem with Ableton Live Lite and that it could be found it in the Plug-Ins section of Ableton, but I figured it out EVENTUALLY regardless"}
{"source": " (Ableton itself is rather dodgy, and seems to crash constantly"}
{"source": ") Sometimes the 2i2 seems to lock up completely, so as no audio is being produced from my monitors!I wasn't sure for a very long time if this was USER ERROR, an Ableton problem, or the fault of the 2i2 and its drivers, so after the gazillionth crash, I screamed \"Ballsdogit!!!\", and purchased a license for Reaper"}
{"source": " After going through the painstaking setup and acclimating to the new DAW over the last few months, I began to realize that my monitors no longer \"lock up\", but that the drivers for the 2i2 are indescribably pathetic!!!I had to tweak the living daylights out of Reaper just to get an audible sound out of my monitors"}
{"source": " Now I'm in there and the FX do not work with the focusrite drivers"}
{"source": " Garbage focusrite! Everyone I know that has Reaper raves about the plug-ins, and the greatness and ease of the setup regardless of the interface"}
{"source": " I have yet to experience a crash, but I also have yet to experience any recording time"}
{"source": "Seriously, I started reading on the Reaper Forums about problems encountered with the 2i2, and came across a response from David@focusrite actually saying that \"you should not use this setup to record electric guitar"}
{"source": "\", and that if you need to record electric guitar you should \"get something with more headroom like the 2i4"}
{"source": "\" That is just unbelievable in my eyes!I'm sure I could run this through my mixer and get the lacking headroom and just use this paperweight as a bridge gap between my mixer and laptop, but why should I have to after dropping a buck fifty on this miracle? Besides that, I'll more than likely still have multiple problems with the drivers!This device is clearly marked for both XLR inputs and 1/4 instrument ins"}
{"source": " There was no warning of headroom limitations anywhere in the documentation, and I researched audio interfaces for several weeks before deciding on this unit"}
{"source": " I feel lied to and disrespected as a customer, now stuck with an irrelevant piece of outdated technology"}
{"source": " HOW IN THE HECK DOES THIS THING HAVE A NEARLY 5 STAR RATING!!!????The good side is that the mic pres are nice and warm"}
{"source": " I have a bunch of different mics and the 2i2 (when not crashing or locking up the monitors) seems to handle all of them well"}
{"source": " I constantly check for driver updates, and have the latest drivers for the 2i2, but without a doubt the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 is probably going by the wayside along with my faith in focusrite and their products"}
{"source": "Sorry focusrite, you dropped the ball here"}
{"source": "How far wrong can you go for $1"}
{"source": "83? I can give these away to beginners that don't have a capo"}
{"source": "If you really want a capo get a Keyser or other decent capo"}
{"source": " They're only $20"}
{"source": "A very decent capo"}
{"source": " Switching is very nice and it holds down all the strings perfectly"}
{"source": " Great for someone who plays on alternate tunings or someone who likes shifting scales often"}
{"source": "I've got several capos, from the highest end models to the cheapest, and this one is every bit as good as the expensive ones, with ease of use and solid build quality"}
{"source": " Why spend more?? Just buy it, and stop over paying for your capos forever more!"}
{"source": "Even though it is Fender it was made in China I would have thought the US"}
{"source": "  What can you say about a guitar chord?"}
{"source": "Nice looking,nice sound and quality to these cables"}
{"source": "They are what I needed!Thank You GO-DPS for making such good quality products"}
{"source": "Does what it's supposed to do"}
{"source": "  Very sturdy feeling"}
{"source": "  Pretty sure I could strangle a person with it if I had to"}
{"source": "  I'm not a dangerous person but you know, when people request wagon-wheel"}
{"source": "At first I thought the idea of using a metal pick was outrageous, but after actually trying one - I love it"}
{"source": " It has really helped me deliever that Fatal Blow"}
{"source": "I can honestly say, this is not for strumming or even heavy metal rhythms as you risk breaking a string and putting an eye out"}
{"source": " Not to mention that it's hard to strum and sounds awful"}
{"source": "What these picks are good for is leads"}
{"source": " Rock, Metal, Shredding and even Country"}
{"source": " The sound is short with a very high tone pitch"}
{"source": " Switching back to a plastic pick and the notes sound a little dull"}
{"source": " One plus is, while recording I do not hear much in the way of the pick scraping when doing alternate picking (shredding) as I did with a plastic pick"}
{"source": "I still use a plastic pick for slow leads that need that sort of sound, but love these picks when things heat up"}
{"source": " Also, I'd like to add that even though I can play Rock You Like A Hurricane by the Scorpions - it never sounds quite right"}
{"source": " Until Now"}
{"source": " Using a metal pick make the lead scream and help the tone carry for a thicker sound"}
{"source": "Also, these picks have a no-slip grip"}
{"source": " With the Fender facing your fingers, there is a nice little indent for the thumb and with the added grooves it's very easy to grip and use"}
{"source": " It feels funny at first, but I got use to it really quick"}
{"source": "I can honestly say that this is one of those things you just have to try for yourself to get the full experience"}
{"source": "I was looking for a nearly indestructable heavy (or thick) guitar pick"}
{"source": "  I saw this and had to try it"}
{"source": "  They are very solid, don't bend, and make a particularly pleasing sound on an acoustic guitar"}
{"source": "  Haven't tried them yet on an electric, but they should be great there, too"}
{"source": "  You need to know that they make a metalic sound to the picking action (not a surprise!)"}
{"source": "  But the angle of attack on the strings can either increase that or lessen it somewhat"}
{"source": "  Anyway, these are great guitar picks if you're looking for something solid and long-lasting"}
{"source": "At this price, these cables are a bargain"}
{"source": "  The jury is still out on how durable they are, but they all arrived in working order and have held up well despite several months of plugging and unplugging"}
{"source": "  The length is great for when you have a bunch of pedals with inputs that vary from top to side"}
{"source": "  I hate it when the patch isn't long enough and I have to mis-allign my pedals !  Anyway, thumbs up"}
{"source": "  Will revisit my review if they begin to fail soon-"}
{"source": "There is not much you can say about these other than they fit my Behringer ULTRAVOICE XM1800S just fine"}
{"source": "  I don't sound to muffled with them on either - the colors made my Podcasting team bicker over who was getting which one"}
{"source": "  I won't hold it against these Windscreens"}
{"source": "I ordered this Capo on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday"}
{"source": " I had never used a Capo of this design so I was a little skiptical but I figured with the price, I might as well give it a try"}
{"source": " This thing works great"}
{"source": " There is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar"}
{"source": " The spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board"}
{"source": " I have only used Kyser Capos in the past but this one works just as well"}
{"source": " Only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to, otherwise you'll get some rattling noise from the strings"}
{"source": " Once you get the hang of placing it where you need it, it works very fast when you need to change keys"}
{"source": "I guess 5 stars because it 100% does what it's supposed to and doesn't cost much"}
{"source": " The width of the grip gives you more leverage which can make it easier to clamp with someone with weak hands"}
{"source": " That being said that person probably isn't playing much guitar"}
{"source": "I hang all my gear up in the studio with these and it's really sturdy"}
{"source": " I can't say these are easy to get the guitar down off the wall but that's the point"}
{"source": " I'll use a stand if I'm going to use a guitar often"}
{"source": " I had a 230lb drummer fall into the wall where I had these baby's hung up and not one fell or almost fell"}
{"source": "I payed the $11 for this just because the tuner I have was so slow to respond I needed something new"}
{"source": "  The response time on this is like half a second and it's super simple to use"}
{"source": "  Keep in mind that the Snark website sells this tuner for $40 so 1/4 the cost here is definitely worth it"}
{"source": "This isn't a terrible tuner, and for how cheap it was, it wasn't a \"ripoff\""}
{"source": " However, it definetly does not work as the product or other people claim"}
{"source": " When it does work, it tunes decently like any ten dollar tuner"}
{"source": " However almost all of the time it's fluttering around to completely different notes or just not reading a single thing"}
{"source": " I try clipping it on different parts of the instrument and it's the same"}
{"source": " It also did not come with batteries, and replacement ones aren't cheap and are very hard to find"}
{"source": " I don't think this is a terrible product due to the low price, but if you want to be taken seriously and take your own music seriously, get a real desktop tuner"}
{"source": " A cheapo one is only 5 bucks more and you can find REAL, full sized, affordable batteries for it"}
{"source": "Ive used this on Guitars acoustic and electric, Ukuleles, Banjos, Banjo Ukeleles, Violins, and mandolins"}
{"source": "  no issues"}
{"source": " well except that sometimes it rattles (quietly), it doesn't effect how it works but i hate a rattling guitar"}
{"source": "  That Just means i take it off most of the time after i tune"}
{"source": "  That's not a bad thing as it keeps me from playing out with the Tuner clipped to the guitar the whole time, and I hate how that looks anyway"}
{"source": "  I love the little thing"}
{"source": "  My only complaint is that (like all other clip on tuners that i've had) it wont turn itself off if i leave it on accidentally, and will then wear out the battery"}
{"source": "Having to send the first Snark SN-8 back, but the replacement, thus far, has been flawless"}
{"source": "I made a slight adjustment to my guitar's truss rod and now the intonation is pretty spot on"}
{"source": "A couple tips to tuning a guitar: tune it like you play it"}
{"source": " If you strum & play softly, then pluck & tune each string softly"}
{"source": "However, most people don't play softly, so they make the mistake that almost everyone makes: they pluck each string and wait like 15 seconds till the ringing fades out, & so they are generally tuning each string as it begins \"softly\" resonating"}
{"source": "So, in essence, what happens is people are generally tuning each string flat"}
{"source": "To tune your guitar correctly, you really ought to pluck each string hard, like every 2 seconds and tune it that way - rather than waiting for the sound to fade out"}
{"source": " If you do it this way, you might be surprised at how good it sounds when you're strumming the living daylight out of it!Also, please check your intonation"}
{"source": " Your 12th frets should be in tune same as your open strings"}
{"source": " You pluck your open string (hard) & tune as described above"}
{"source": " Then you check intonation by pressing VERY LIGHTLY (with JUST the TIP of your FINGER and DON'T TOUCH ANY OTHER PART of the NECK), on the same string, but 12th fret - and BOTH should be in tune the EXACT same"}
{"source": "If they are off (12TH & open), then your intonation is probably in need of adjustment"}
{"source": " Please don't pay someone to setup your guitar! You can do it yourself so easily"}
{"source": " Go on u toob and search \"scott grove tuning your guitar wrong\" and u will find a video of a guy that claims to have owned over 3,000 guitars - & he spends almost an hour explaining all the details"}
{"source": " Also, watch his video on how to setup: adjust intonation, truss rod, action, etc"}
{"source": "Btw, if you can't get your Snark to tune your guitar: hint - it's not the tuner's fault"}
{"source": " The first 3 saddles (e, b, g) should look like a staircase going down"}
{"source": " Then, your next 3 strings (d,  a, e) should also look like another staircase going down"}
{"source": " If not, break out your philips head & tweak your intonation"}
{"source": "I had the red Snark and a couple others"}
{"source": " This one is the best ive tried so far"}
{"source": " No problems and does give you a tighter faster tuning"}
{"source": " 6 stars if they had it that high"}
{"source": "I love the Snark tuners but don't know that I'd call it super tight or faster than the older SN-2"}
{"source": " I feel the display is an improvement - easy on the eyes"}
{"source": " Hopefully, more reliable than SN-2"}
{"source": " I've had pixels dropping out on one SN-2 that is less than a year old but have another one that is doing fine"}
{"source": " Too soon to tell if the SN-8 will hang in there"}
{"source": "I don't see it as a faster device than the older model and have had coupling problems with it clamped to an SG"}
{"source": " Don't know why as it works fine with acoustics and Strat"}
{"source": " Response time on the SG is longer than the older SN-2 model but, I haven't yet tried to understand what's going on with it"}
{"source": " Have't tried it on bass yet but, I know that the SN-2 didn't play well with the E string open"}
{"source": " No big deal, I just tune it at 12th fret"}
{"source": " Could choose any note since it's chromatic"}
{"source": " Speaking of which, playing along with a song that was pitch shifted is easier with the Snark"}
{"source": " Tune any string to match the song and then, tune the other strings with the same displayed error"}
{"source": "Bottom line is that it's a great tuner and it's not likely that I'll get much use out of the old Korg tuner that once balanced on my knee"}
{"source": "I don't play professionally so there is no need to buy expensive pedal tuners such as Hardwire HT-6, Polytune or Korg Pitchblack"}
{"source": "  I researched for other alternatives and decided on a \"clip on\" tuner"}
{"source": "  I narrowed it down to 3 - Korg AW2, Snark SN-1 & Intelli IMT-900"}
{"source": "  All 3 have a lot of positive reviews and all of them are under $20"}
{"source": "  I visited each manufacturers' website for more information and found out about the Snark SN-8"}
{"source": "  Snark claims that it's their best tuner yet"}
{"source": "  If their SN-1 can go toe to toe with the others, then I would assume that their best will do even better"}
{"source": "  I took the plunge and ordered one"}
{"source": "  I have only 2 requirements for a tuner:1"}
{"source": "  It should be accurate"}
{"source": "2"}
{"source": "  It should be fast"}
{"source": "The Snark SN-8 delivered on both counts and more!  It came with other extras like \"tap tempo metronome\", \"super tight tuning\", \"pitch calibration\", \"transpose features\" etc"}
{"source": "  I may not have any use for all of them right now but it's nice to have them at your fingertips"}
{"source": "  You can use it for other instruments as well but I only use it for my guitars"}
{"source": "  The SN-8 is small & unobtrusive"}
{"source": "  The display is bright and easily readable and can turn any which way you like"}
{"source": "  After tuning, I turn it off and put it back in the guitar case"}
{"source": "  I don't like it hanging in my guitar!  Of course, it doesn't stay long because it tunes fast!  For under $20, these little tuner is all you need"}
{"source": "fast and accurate"}
{"source": "  Try it, you won't be disappointed"}
{"source": "Edit: I've had to downgrade my star rating a bit, so I've revised my review- full explanation below, but in short, this just doesn't work as well for me as the SN-1"}
{"source": "Background- I have the original SN-1 as well, and have had it for a couple years"}
{"source": " The ball socket on the back of the tuning head broke fairly quickly when I forgot to remove it from the headstock before putting it in the gig bag (Protec Contego semi-rigid hybrid case with a little more room around the headstock than your average padded bag)"}
{"source": " I rigged a repair that has worked OK, but figured a replacement was in order"}
{"source": " However other than the broken socket, this has been one of the best tuners I've ever used"}
{"source": " Very quick and intuitive"}
{"source": " Bright and easy to read in all lighting conditions"}
{"source": " Fast response on all strings, including the low B on several five string basses"}
{"source": " Despite what I feel is a weakness in the design (the fragile socket), I still felt so good about the functionality of the product that I ordered another, this time the SN-8(B) \"Super Tight\" tuner"}
{"source": " I decided to go with another model in the hopes that a newer model might be a little better reinforced at the ball sockets (hence the \"super tight\", perhaps?)"}
{"source": "Out of the box, the SN-8 is almost identical to the original, save for the obvious color differences"}
{"source": " Then clamp appears the same and doesn't seem to have any greater clamping force that I could detect"}
{"source": " Turning it on though, the display is quite different"}
{"source": " Basically, it is much more \"to the point\""}
{"source": " The indicator bars either side of the center pitch (\"in-tune\", dead center) are much wider and fewer, meaning a less granular and less precise display, but one that is very easy to read at a glance in any light"}
{"source": " This could be a mixed blessing, but the up side is it is brighter, simpler, and potentially quicker for on the fly tuning"}
{"source": " The downside is it is not granular enough to say, intonate an instrument's bridge"}
{"source": " It also seems to respond much quicker, which I am realizing is also mixed blessing, and here we have the missing star"}
{"source": " The speed also means it responds really quickly to all input, meaning it seems to want to constantly change the note it is sensing"}
{"source": " It seems much more twitchy than the sn-1"}
{"source": " Unless you are able to mute every other string fully, it will jump between notes frequently"}
{"source": " This is also one of my (many) complaints about the Planet Waves Mini-Headstock Tuner too"}
{"source": "  I've found that attempting to tune with loud background music or other instruments blasting through a PA will cause my instrument to vibrate at other frequencies - even if I successfully mute all other strings, making tuning with the SN-8 that much more difficult"}
{"source": " The differences here between the SN-8 and SN-1 are quite noticeable"}
{"source": " For that reason, I just ordered another SN-1"}
{"source": "I can't say how this tuner would work for other instruments, as I am a bass player"}
{"source": " I'm not sure there is or isn't a defect or flaw here, perhaps it just didn't live up to my expectations (set high by my awesome experience with the original)"}
{"source": " Simply put, my sampling size is too small to say for sure or proclaim this a bad product"}
{"source": "  All I know is that it just isn't working very well for me"}
{"source": " If I saved the packaging for this one, I may consider sending it back in exchange for a second SN-1 or perhaps another model"}
{"source": " If not, it'll probably be the one I hand others when they want to borrow my tuner ;)"}
{"source": "If an initially unfavorable opinion changes, I owe it to the maker to say so, so I'm saying so!For me, the hardest part of adjusting to a new tuner is throwing out preconceived notions of how it should be used"}
{"source": "It's not always easy getting vibration sensing tuners to settle down"}
{"source": " In many cases, they jump around until, by the time they settle down, the vibration has decayed to the point where it no longer registers"}
{"source": " So, a bit of subjective judgment is sometimes involved"}
{"source": "As far as the SN-8 is concerned"}
{"source": "WRONG!I've found the SN-8 to, in fact, be Super Tight, BUT one has to insure that there isn't even a HINT of red or yellow on either side of the center green bar"}
{"source": "This is what I don't like about the other type of Snark display"}
{"source": "  It's not symmetric!  It requires all of the red bars to be lit along with the green, and none of the yellow bars to be lit"}
{"source": "  If the rad bars are illuminated constantly, how can you tell if the string is a hair flat?  When I'm on pitch I want *all* indications of sharpness and flatness to vanish"}
{"source": "In that regard, the image shown here is wrong! It shows the Super Tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with Green and even a yellow"}
{"source": " Uhm"}
{"source": "no"}
{"source": "The SN-8 is Super Tight, has a touch metronome, and lets you set it down a few semi-tones if that's what floats your boat and, as they say on TV, \"All for an incredibly low price!\"I keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag, just in case"}
{"source": "  At this price, I already have a half dozen Super Tights with two more on the way"}
{"source": "I will keep my review short as there have been MANY factual and well written reviews for the various Snark tuners over the years"}
{"source": "  Quickly though, I will start by also agreeing that for the price, it is hard to beat"}
{"source": "  This is mostly why I have given it 4 stars and just bought a sixth one"}
{"source": "  It is accurate, reliable for tuning, and affordable"}
{"source": "  All that said, here is why I decided to write a review"}
{"source": "  I have owned about 5 of these Snarks and every single one has broken after about 3-4 months use"}
{"source": "  The unit itself is great"}
{"source": "  Here is the problem"}
{"source": "  Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to it's own clip is where this little gem falls short"}
{"source": "  Sure, if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home, it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky"}
{"source": "  However, if you travel with it, take it on or off a few guitars a day, or frequently adjust it, it will likely eventually break"}
{"source": "  Either the \"rubber feet\" that come into contact with the head stock of the guitar will come off and get lost or the little ball joint that connects the tuner's head to the clip part will break"}
{"source": "  Best to get several of these at this great price and just keep one on each of your guitars"}
{"source": "  One for the electric, one for the acoustic, etc"}
{"source": "  This item does not travel well and is best used at home gently"}
{"source": "Tried this and was not happy"}
{"source": " Seemed to want to be off too much"}
{"source": " Got the Fender FT-004 instead"}
{"source": " This one does have a great view on the LED, but if it doesn't tune right, what's the point? I would try the Fender"}
{"source": " Just a note"}
{"source": " if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner"}
{"source": " I would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing"}
{"source": " Just a thought"}
{"source": "For $13, its hard to say anything bad about this gadget"}
{"source": " It's accurate in any sound environment, easy to read in any light, very portable, and will tune any stringed instrument"}
{"source": " The visual metronome with no click or beep is pretty useless but that's a silly extra that doesn't interfere with anything so no problem"}
{"source": "This is hands-down the best tuner I've *ever* owned"}
{"source": " The Snark SN8 works extremely well, and being chromatic, works on every stringed instrument I own (guitar, bass, banjo, violin) no matter what key the instrument is tuned to"}
{"source": " I still use my Korg Pitchblack inline with my bass (also a very nice product), but that is mainly to get more cord length across the stage and still keep my signal strong"}
{"source": " This little baby is amazingly easy to use, and always accurate"}
{"source": " It has a nice bright easy to read display in any lighting situation and makes tuning a breeze and not a hassle (just as it should be - I've personally always hated those Boss pedal tuners)"}
{"source": " It simply does its job and does it very well"}
{"source": "Also, buying this item from Amazon saved me quite a bit over the local Guitar Center, which is always a big plus"}
{"source": " It feels tough too, this thing feels like it can easily handle the rigors of being tossed around, which is a very good thing"}
{"source": " Despite the flimsy way the seller packaged this for shipping, the product arrived intact, and fast"}
{"source": " I would have cropped a star for a damaged product in that little wimpy envelope they sent it in"}
{"source": " Fortunately mine arrived in perfect condition (no thanks to that paper envelope - seriously, they should use a stiff cardboard envelope or small tube or something)"}
{"source": "I could not be happier, at least until I buy another one to keep at the house while the first stays in my gig bag"}
{"source": "Musician's Gear Tubular Guitar Stand Black Pair is a good deal for musician"}
{"source": " Buy it, if you would like to have your guitars ready to play anytime you want to"}
{"source": "Cheap stands get the job done i have 0 problems so far"}
{"source": " I've taken them from new jersey to south carolina"}
{"source": "I'll echo what others have said: this is a superbly built instrument for the price, and I don't know how Epiphone can make them to sell so inexpensively"}
{"source": " It looks, feels and plays like an instrument that cost at least twice as much"}
{"source": "A few notes: what looks in the product photos like a black finish around the edges and on the back and sides of the &#34;Vintage&#34; model is actually a super-rich deep, deep mahogany/maroon color, and it's unbelievably beautiful"}
{"source": "As others have said, the factory-supplied strings are crap; if you judge the instrument by them, you'll be disappointed"}
{"source": " Include a set of Aqila Nylgut strings when you order this ukulele, and restring it as soon as you get it"}
{"source": "I was a little surprised that the sound was quieter than my $60 Kala soprano uke--normally, one expects a concert ukulele to have a louder, fuller sound"}
{"source": " But the Les Paul has a relatively small soundbox compared to an all-acoustic ukulele, and that probably accounts for the quieter tone"}
{"source": " I think it's a *better* tone, and I'm more interested in delicacy than in loudness, so I'm happy with it"}
{"source": " If I wanted stadium-filling volume, I could always plug this into a stack of Marshall amps"}
{"source": "Oh, I almost forgot one important note to all owners: IT IS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE THE STUPID, UGLY PICK GUARD! Since ukulele players rarely use picks, and when we do, we use soft rubber or felt ones, there's no need to protect the finish from scratching, and that white pick guard really detracts from the instrument's looks"}
{"source": "I applied gentle heat from a hair dryer on its low power setting for about ten minutes, and very slowly and gently pried up the edges of the pick guard with my fingernails--no sharp tools! It came off pretty cleanly, leaving only a few small spots of adhesive residue"}
{"source": " I was able to get rid of those with small amounts of rubbing alcohol on cotton, without any damage to the luscious ultra-glossy lacquer finish"}
{"source": " And the ukulele looks SO much better now! If you feel as I do, feel free to do likewise"}
{"source": " Just remember the key words: SLOW and GENTLE"}
{"source": " Don't force anything, and you should be fine"}
{"source": "Upon arrival, I was astonished"}
{"source": " With a box as monstrous as the one this little number arrived in, I was expecting a ukulele made for Andre the Giant"}
{"source": "It's not quite as big as the packaging leads one to believe but the sound sure is!The unplugged tone is warm and sweet, like the most delightful brownie you could ever imagine"}
{"source": " Plugged in it really shines"}
{"source": " I paired mine with a Pignose 7-100 for street performing and, while it is a bit too chilly to play for nickels at the moment, I have no doubt this will pay for itself in the long run"}
{"source": "I was slightly surprised at how slim the body is (similar in scale to an actual Les Paul), as I was expecting a fuller body but it doesn't hurt the playability a bit"}
{"source": "The finish is gorgeous and the little stick-on pickguard is just too adorable for words"}
{"source": "If you're hemming and hawing over getting one, just do it"}
{"source": " You'll be oh so pleasantly surprised"}
{"source": "I recently purchased this ukulele from a local Guitar Center"}
{"source": " When i first got there i was looking at the Lanikai brand, but when i picked it up it was so light and thin that I felt like a strong wind could tear it apart"}
{"source": " Then I saw this one"}
{"source": " It has a little bet of weight and had a fuller sound than the other ukes in my price range"}
{"source": " I have already learned the basic chords and can't wait to become proficient with this instrument"}
{"source": "I enjoy playing this thing so much"}
{"source": " It's reasonably quiet acoustically, but it shines when plugged in"}
{"source": " Plus is looks good - the actual color and finish are quite rich and shiny, respectively"}
{"source": "It stays in tune (after string break-in) and the intonation is ok - not spot on but definitely good enough"}
{"source": " The tuners are basic, but they work well"}
{"source": " It is thinner than a normal uke, about half the body depth"}
{"source": " I find holding it without a strap to be harder than a normal sized uke, but with a strap it's very comfortable"}
{"source": "Mine came with the pick guard in the bag pocket"}
{"source": " The bag itself is also pretty basic, but good enough for what it is - a bag to hold your uke and some misc"}
{"source": " items"}
{"source": "This is a sweet ukulele and it looks just as sweet as it sounds! Change the strings immediately, and you have yourself an excellent sounding instrument"}
{"source": "  Amplify it with a touch of chorus and feel it too!Only drawback - there is no volume control on the instrument itself"}
{"source": "The amp cable that is included is nothing to write home about, and the gig back is a cheap nylon deal - BUT, it's all about the instrument, and I give that a 5"}
{"source": "My wife was worried about what to get me for Christmas, I really didn't want anything (other than the Harley I have been asking for for 25 years, maybe next???) and while surfing Amazon I came across this Les Paul"}
{"source": " I had to laugh since it looks so much like my Gibson Les Paul, kind of like a \"Mini Me\" version"}
{"source": "Well I have never heard of a Les Paul Uke and did not think for $99 that it would be much"}
{"source": "but the reviews were telling a different story"}
{"source": " So I found my Christmas present at last for \"the man who has everything\" (it is true, my wife told me"}
{"source": "still hoping for that Harley though)"}
{"source": " I ordered it a few days before Christmas so it would not be under the tree much to my wife's dismay"}
{"source": "but I printed a photo of it and framed it then wrapped it up and placed it under the tree anyway"}
{"source": " Well Christmas came which means it was also one day closer to getting the real thing (the Uke, not the Harley), but everyone had a laugh at my shocked expression and obvious glee when I opened up my framed photo of my soon to be baby Les Paul!I figured since I was taking my fellow Amazonian's word I better order some Aquila Ukulele Strings since everyone stated that the ones that came with the Uke are junk(and they are, shame of Epiphone) which I did, the Uke arrived about 4 days before the strings but I attempted to learn how to play it anyway"}
{"source": "OUCH those stock strings were rough on the fingers, and the sound left much to be desired so I waited until the new string were installed prior to this review"}
{"source": "Wow with the new strings it is totally like a different instrument, it now sounds as good as it looks and sooooo much easier on the ole fingers"}

{"source": "I really don't see how Gibson can make and sell these for $99!  The tech at the guitar shop can't see how either"}
{"source": "  I plugged this into my roland micro cube and tried some effects"}
{"source": "  I was really surprised to see how well they sounded"}
{"source": "  I'm not a guitar player so this uke is just a toy/experiment for me"}
{"source": "  If you are really into electric sound, I recommend going the guitar route"}
{"source": "  If you just want to play around a little, this uke will do"}
{"source": "* SHIPPING"}
{"source": "  The Epiphone comes wrapped in  protective foam, inside a gig bag, which is inside a sturdy standard tri-shaped box, which is itself shipped inside a HUGE box twice its size and totally surrounded by sturdy bubble plastic"}
{"source": "  That huge box is then inside yet ANOTHER huge box"}
{"source": "  Honestly, to protect this better they'd have had to contact Tony Stark"}
{"source": "  It would take real skill and intent to damage this thing in shipping"}
{"source": "  EXCELLENT job"}
{"source": "  5 stars on that alone"}
{"source": "* SIZE"}
{"source": " Overall length 24\""}
{"source": "  Fretboard 10\""}
{"source": "  Nut to bridge 15\""}
{"source": "  So good overall medium-size"}
{"source": "  I like that it's a bit larger than a 20-21\" soprano uke"}
{"source": "  It is \"concert\" size (which I greatly prefer over soprano"}
{"source": "  Frankly, I'd like to see a baritone version)"}
{"source": "  The 24\" length is an excellent size for both adult and youth / child fingers"}
{"source": "* QUALITY"}
{"source": "  From stern to port, this instrument shines"}
{"source": "  Beautifully lacquered flawless finish, protective edging, plastic finger-guard (which itself was guarded in adhesive plastic), solid neck screw-joined to heavy-wood body"}
{"source": "  The whole unit is heavy-wood and very durable"}
{"source": "  Nevertheless the sound is quite good"}
{"source": "  The tuners are acceptable quality (nothing amazing, but they work well)"}
{"source": "  The frets are actual metal and not molded into the fingerboard like cheap ukes"}
{"source": "  The amp-jack is chrome-metal back-plated to the body; it's NOT coming loose"}
{"source": "  Strap holders are already mounted, saving users the hassle"}
{"source": "  And of course, the impressive EPIPHONE and LES PAUL signature stamps on the head for sheer class"}
{"source": "* SOUND"}
{"source": "  I found this to sound as good as most ukes right out of the box, despite the fact it's pretty solid-wood electric (I expected it to sound dull"}
{"source": "  It doesn't"}
{"source": ")  But I still bought a set of d'Addario strings (a brand I've loved for years) and according to other reviews here expect the sound to improve significantly once those are added"}
{"source": "* ACTION"}
{"source": " I've rarely seen a purchased instrument that has perfect action off the shelf and this is no exception"}
{"source": " The action is fairly high (not uncommon with off-the-shelf instruments)"}
{"source": "  One will need to remove the strings (keep them for emergency spares), file down the bridge bottom (easily done with a flat surface and sandpaper) and add a new set of quality strings"}
{"source": "  I'm a perfectionist when it comes to action (as are most players I know), so this will be tweaked"}
{"source": "* DURABILITY"}
{"source": "  It's very durable"}
{"source": "  That counts for the gig bag too"}
{"source": "  No cheap \"tent nylon\" there-- but thick nylon that will really resist tearing"}
{"source": "  As others mentioned I'd still look for a decent hard case; they average under $40"}
{"source": "  A good instrument is worth protecting"}
{"source": "  But I'd say this could take some real punishment and still play well-- not that I'd go bashing it against a stage floor"}
{"source": "  That would be goofy"}
{"source": "* WEIRD SUGGESTION:  Hang on to the box it comes in"}
{"source": "  It makes a great temporary \"hard shell\" case"}
{"source": " It's made of rather sturdy cardboard and does a pretty good job of protecting the uke"}
{"source": "  Great for hauling around in your car if you can't shell out for a shell"}
{"source": " Seriously"}
{"source": " that is some stiff cardboard"}
{"source": "  Protects well"}
{"source": "  : )* ELECTRONICS"}
{"source": "  The sound is clear"}
{"source": " Sadly there is no volume/tone control, no battery to preamp, and thus the signal to the amp was quite low"}
{"source": "  They could have done better on that end"}
{"source": "  But wow, at this price how can one gripe?Two solutions to this:1) Open up the end plate and totally replace the electronics with something better (including a tone and volume knob somewhere accessible)"}
{"source": "  That's the tricky way"}
{"source": "2) Put a preamp on this"}
{"source": " You can buy one here on Amazon for about 15 bucks"}
{"source": " If you have a mini-mixer you can do the same thing with that"}
{"source": "  Even with that little extra expense you'll come out ahead"}
{"source": "Aside from the passive electronics"}
{"source": " this is a PRIME instrument"}
{"source": "  It is a mid-size uke so you can choose to string it either as a soprano (if you're careful and don't tune it too quickly) or a baritone (guitar 4th - 1st string, E-high), depending on the strings you choose"}
{"source": "Considering what you get for the price"}
{"source": " I don't think this can be beat"}
{"source": "  Unfortunately, my extra-long fingers find this very difficult to play"}
{"source": " something I didn't consider when ordering a uke"}
{"source": "  But that's a physical difficulty and no fault of the instrument"}
{"source": "  The product itself is excellent"}
{"source": "The adjustment screw for the boom is a piece of crap, a really small set screw that strips out almost immediately"}
{"source": "  Replace that with something stronger and this would be a great stand"}
{"source": "  They are light weight and if all you need is mic support in a fixed setting, good enuf okay I guess"}
{"source": "  But after transporting and reset, I found them to be junk"}
{"source": "I didn't know when I ordered these mic stands that they were On Stage stands"}
{"source": " They are fully adjustable, great for angling over cymbals to record drums or for using without the boom as great stands for vocal mics"}
{"source": " Excellent quality"}
{"source": " I'm very happy with this set"}
{"source": "I wanted P-90 pickups"}
{"source": " They do make noise kind of like an old album"}
{"source": " Once you start playing you don't notice it though"}
{"source": " Other than that the guitar stays tuned and is a blast for a beginner like me to bang around on"}
{"source": " It looks really good!"}
{"source": "I am still considering myself a beginner with the guitar"}
{"source": "  I have learned a few songs, but I still am not that good enough to spend a huge amount of money on a guitar"}
{"source": "  I wanted something that would sound nice and still be relatively cheap"}
{"source": "  I had the Dean Electric Guitars in the past and a Fender Acoustic a while ago"}
{"source": "  The Fender and the Dean's were very nice"}
{"source": "  I thought the Dean's had a very nice sound to them and so did the Fender"}
{"source": "  This guitar has a very nice sound to it as well"}
{"source": "  I couldn't figure out the different tunings on it though"}
{"source": "  It said Rhythm and Treble and then just regular in the middle"}
{"source": "  I kept it on the regular because it sounded normal"}
{"source": "  The other one's must be for some special type of music"}
{"source": "  But this guitar sounded just as good if not better than the Dean's"}
{"source": "  It is also very easy to hold unlike the Dean's I have found"}
{"source": "  The Dean's also had warped necks which made some notes not playable and I have not found one on this guitar which is a plus"}
{"source": "  But this is a very nice beginner's guitar if your just looking to get started"}
{"source": "  I would stay away from those Fender knockoff's and stuff like that and get this guitar"}
{"source": "  I also got the cheap Rogue amp to use with it and it sounds great, plenty loud enough if not too loud sometimes"}
{"source": "  All in all, a very nice bargain"}
{"source": "I have owned this guitar for about 2 years now, and it still has a great sound and is very playable, especially for the money"}
{"source": " It stays in tune very well even though the tuners do seem a little cheaper than Epiphones I've owned in the past"}
{"source": " but hey, they work so why change them? The overall fit and finish of the guitar is excellent for the price point, and mine has the flat black finish which hides fingerprints very well"}
{"source": " The neck is fast and smooth and great for quick playing"}
{"source": " The single coil p90 style pickups on this guitar scream with their own beautiful raw sound, and were the reason I bought this guitar"}
{"source": " Take note that p90's do make a humming sound when you're not playing, which can be remedied by turning down the volume knob"}
{"source": " This is why humbucker style pickups were invented, but the compromise of a humbucker is you lose a lot of the bite and energy that p90's give you"}
{"source": " It really has the sound of a higher dollar guitar"}
{"source": " I currently play it through a Fender Vibro Champ tube amp and this combo really makes playing guitar fun"}
{"source": " I recommend this guitar if you're on a budget like me, or even if you're not on a budget and want a p90 equipped guitar in your stable"}
{"source": "As a gigging musician and guitar player for over 25 years I am always in the hunt for something different"}
{"source": " I love Fenders especially telecasters (I love the simplicity of two pickups, two knobs, and a p-up selector)"}
{"source": " I wanted something with P-90s and have been impressed with budget level guitars as of late"}
{"source": " You can get a lot more for your money these days"}
{"source": "I pulled the trigger on one of these Les Paul Special P-90 by Epi and have been really impressed"}
{"source": " I actually bought it as a modification platform but as of yet, I can't really think of anything to change"}
{"source": "Pros - Simple, TV yellow is great looking with wood grain showing through, Shorter scale has that familiar Les Paul feel"}
{"source": " Sounds KILLER through my tube amps (Peavey Classic 30 and 50, Fender Blues Jr"}
{"source": "), lightweight, stays in tune, cheap price (not afraid to take it out to a gig, not afraid to have it stolen, let my kids play it, etc"}
{"source": "), comfortable neck profile"}
{"source": "Cons - Cheap tuners (but stay in tune), cheap electronics (wiring), some frets are long and sharp (my high E string gets caught under the 14th/15th fret - I haven't filed it yet), messy job at nut and fret board"}
{"source": "All in all, this is a great guitar for a great price"}
{"source": " I still plan on modding it, but as it stands it is perfect with all its imperfections"}
{"source": " My upgrades, if any, will be new pots, caps, wiring, nut, perhaps tuners"}
{"source": " No need to replace these pickups"}
{"source": " You get to a certain point of diminishing returns when modding a cheap guitar like this"}
{"source": " At a certain point your cost of upgrades will exceed the cost of the instrument"}
{"source": "As a bit of a guitar snob (love my US Fenders) this guitar is getting a lot of action"}
{"source": " I say this one just may be a keeper"}
{"source": "I just recieved these in the mail today, and these seem to be much better quality than the original pegs in my guitar! Not much else to describe, they're fairly simple to use, and they're selling you 12 of them, so I have a spare set now! My original pegs were also white, on an all black guitar, so I'm totally excited for the new look these pegs give my guitar"}
{"source": " I definitely recommend these for anyone that needs/wants black pegs for their acoustic, or acoustic/electric gutiar"}
{"source": "Good for the price, but  If you can spend a few dollars more, I would recommend the graph tech ones"}
{"source": "good quality plastic and attractive and cheap replacement for any acoustic guitar, slotted with taper and fits well in my bridges"}
{"source": "they did the job"}
{"source": "  they're plastic"}
{"source": "  they didn't cost much"}
{"source": "  fit my 12 string with no problems"}
{"source": "  they aren't bone, brass, wood, pearl, don't expect them to be"}
{"source": "I love this tuner! Its awesome to use and efficient! The only thing I wonder about sometimes is how accurate they actually are"}
{"source": " To my ear it sounds good but you never know???"}
{"source": "this tuner works great"}
{"source": "  it is easy to see and accurate for basic guitar tuning"}
{"source": "  I use mine all the time between different alternative tunings"}
{"source": "  I liked it so much, I bought one for my grandson who is learning to play guitar as well"}
{"source": "  a great investment unless you have a perfect ear"}
{"source": "This is not just a tuner - its a peacekeeper for our band"}
{"source": "  Arguing over tuning can really take up time"}
{"source": "  It works so good everyone in our acoustic string band is required to have one attached!  I do kind of miss the fights over who's in tune and who's flat, though"}
{"source": "  Excellent product, though the metronome is of no value, but that's not important"}
{"source": "  We use it for guitars, violins, violas, cello, bass guitar, voice training, and ordering pizza (who ever is out of tune pays the pizza bill)"}
{"source": "I've been using this amp for a few months and I'm very pleased with the overall quality and performance"}
{"source": " I was looking for a small studio amp and watched the demo video on YouTube"}
{"source": " I ordered it through Amazon and it arrived quickly"}
{"source": " The amp has two shades or flavors as I call it"}
{"source": " I only use the clean side or input one"}
{"source": " This is what Fender calls Blaceface Clean"}
{"source": " No matter how hard you push that channel it won't break up and sounds great with no FX's running"}
{"source": " I really haven't used channel two much"}
{"source": " These are all your pre-sets which many amps are doing these days"}
{"source": " I'm pretty much old school and like to find my own sound"}
{"source": " However they do sound very good and you can change a lot of these settings both from the front panel and through your computer"}
{"source": " The amp itself hooks right into your USB connection such as Gargeband or other recording boards or software"}
{"source": " The amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on"}
{"source": " It's a loud 15 watts"}
{"source": " I have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems"}
{"source": " If your looking for a studio/home/1st amp you can't go wrong with this guy"}
{"source": " It's now my go to amp in the studio"}
{"source": " You can make this amp sound many different ways and with an FX chain in front of channel one (how I run it) the sky is the limit"}
{"source": " Haven't used the software that you need to download from Fender but will look at it later"}
{"source": " right now this amp doesn't need to be tweaked for me"}
{"source": "I loved it right out of the box! Give it a test drive and let your ears decide"}
{"source": "This is the greatest practice amp ever"}
{"source": "  And by practice I mean practicing by yourself and with a band"}
{"source": "First, it's all tube, so it sounds really good"}
{"source": "  It's gets nice and dirty as you crank it and sounds warm at all volumes"}
{"source": "  It also takes pedals well and can sound like a beast"}
{"source": "Second, it's 15 watts and is pretty darn loud"}
{"source": "  I've used it for band practice and it's definitely loud enough to keep up with a drummer"}
{"source": "  At a bar you'll probably need to mic it or use the included line-out"}
{"source": "Third, if the 10&#34; speaker isn't loud enough, you can plug it into a cabinet to push more air, it sounds great in the 4x12 and 2x12 cabs I have"}
{"source": "  That'll make it loud enough for most bars"}
{"source": "Fourth, it has great sounding built in effects, nearly everything you'll need"}
{"source": "  Most small tube amps don't have built in effects"}
{"source": "  So if you're trying to practice down in the living room, you're forced to drag your effects with you"}
{"source": "  That's annoying"}
{"source": "  With this amp everything is built in"}
{"source": "Fifth, unlike a lot of tube amps, this one gets very quiet"}
{"source": "  You can turn it way down, keep the warm tone, and practice without bothering anyone else"}
{"source": "Sixth, the price is amazing"}
{"source": "  All tube, build in effects, and line and speaker out"}
{"source": " wow"}
{"source": "  Fender is basically giving these things away"}
{"source": "I love this amp so much I want to buy one for every guitarist I know"}
{"source": "  The only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch"}
{"source": "  But considering the price, that's understandable"}
{"source": " There's no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them"}
{"source": "  You'll only want the cover and footswitch if you're playing in a band"}
{"source": "I have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers, including a few of the Vox Valvetronix series"}
{"source": "  However, this is both my first Fender amp, as well as my first true &#34;tube&#34; amp"}
{"source": "  First, some clarification is needed on &#34;tube&#34; vs"}
{"source": " &#34;modeling&#34; amp"}
{"source": "  The Fender Super Champ X2 is absolutely a tube amp - it has one 12AX7 and two 6V6's, and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages"}
{"source": "  However, the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone, which is what allows it to project different &#34;voices&#34;"}
{"source": "  Contrary to what some posters have written, Channel 1 does also have some front-end modeling, except that the the model is fixed for &#34;Blackface&#34; tone and controlled by a separate volume know (no gain control)"}
{"source": "  Channel 2 offers 16 different &#34;Voice&#34; presets and 10 of these model a variety of vintage Fender amplifiers, including the Tweed Deluxe, Bassman, Deluxe, Princeton, and Twin"}
{"source": "  Settings 9-15 model a variety of other popular amps, including the Vox AC30 and Marshall"}
{"source": "Overall, I found the available tones to be excellent"}
{"source": "  Unlike my Valvetronix, where I more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times, I could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars"}
{"source": "  One thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently - you may have to adjust volume, gain, bass, and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp"}
{"source": "  However, I found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component"}
{"source": "  Also, the X2 does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or &#34;hissing&#34; you hear with digital modeling amps"}
{"source": "The tones that come out of the 10&#34; speaker of the Super Champ X2 are very rich and touch-responsive, as you'd expect from a tube amp"}
{"source": "  The amp has TONS of high-end sparkle, but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume (true of many amps)"}
{"source": "  The stock speaker, which is Fender's own design (and has a ceramic magnet, I believe), is frequently criticized as a weak point"}
{"source": "  However, it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps (or only intend on playing at bedroom levels), you're unlikely to take issue with it"}
{"source": "  The Eminence Ragin' Cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end"}
{"source": "  But, again, the amp is plenty loud and full-sounding for its size"}
{"source": "  Better intended for home/studio use than most gigs, but it excels at what it does"}
{"source": "That brings us to the effects section and the Fender FUSE software that works with the amp via USB cable"}
{"source": "  Frankly, I'm not a fan of most on-board effects with combo amplifiers"}
{"source": "  I prefer to use pedals for modulation, delay, and some overdrive/distortion"}
{"source": "  The good new is that the on-board reverbs (which include spring, room, hall, and a few others if you install them from the software) are quite good"}
{"source": "  You can also reassign the presets to different effects"}
{"source": "  So, if you want a flanger with a reverb, you can have a setting for that"}
{"source": "  If you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb, you can do that too"}
{"source": "  The Tap Tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects"}
{"source": "  But, as I said, while they represent a good value for players that don't want to invest in pedals, I'm more likely to use my Boss DD-3 than the on-board delay, and so on"}
{"source": "The build quality of the Super Champ X2 is largely excellent"}
{"source": "  The grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of Fender's more expensive amps"}
{"source": "  The amp weighs in at 24 pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top"}
{"source": "  One thing I did note, however, is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting, so I will have to be careful about that"}
{"source": "  Also, there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better"}
{"source": "  But overall, the amp looks very well constructed"}
{"source": "  I was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic, but everything is mapped to vintage-looking knobs, and from a few feet back, the amp looks just as much at home in the 60's as it does post-2000"}
{"source": "Overall, I think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that I hope to enjoy for years to come"}
{"source": "  I'm only really scratching the surface of its potential, but it makes great Fender tone sound easy"}
{"source": "  The Fender FUSE software could be a little more intuitive to work with, and I wish there were a better way to know what each of the Voice and F/X settings correspond to without consulting a chart"}
{"source": "  But it's a great little amplifier that's all the power you'd need for hobbyists and studio recording, and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well"}
{"source": "I have used one of the black box meter style tuners for years and struggled with it"}
{"source": " I could never quite get the fine tune I was looking for, and I have a little bit if a pitch issue trying to tune by ear"}
{"source": " These little tuners are amazing"}
{"source": " So easy to use, and portable, and cheap"}
{"source": " I have several now, one for every guitar"}
{"source": " Cheap is important, because they are made of plastic and I have had one break at the joint after a lot of use"}
{"source": " I also received one without a battery, which upset me at the time"}
{"source": " I am in Afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by"}
{"source": " If you figure they cost about as much as a fancy coffee drink they provide a lot of tuning goodness for a little money"}
{"source": "Originally I bought another Snark, and liked it well enough"}
{"source": " I'd seen this one on YouTube, and thought its little bobble head looked "}
{"source": " kinda silly"}
{"source": " But then a friend lent me his for a couple of days, and I really liked the experience of being able to glance over and see if I was in tune"}
{"source": " I was hooked"}
{"source": " I'll look silly if it lets me stay in tune"}
{"source": "The built-in metronome doesn't have a lot of volume, but it's clearly visible"}
{"source": "You also get a little baggie containing three picks, the carry bag for the tuner, and a battery"}
{"source": " Warranty runs for a year"}
{"source": " Altogether, I'm very satisfied with this tuner"}
{"source": "It seems redundant to review again except to point out I have bought more and will buy more"}
{"source": " I will have one for every instrument stored with and actually on each guitar inside it's case"}
{"source": " I have given out 5 and kept 4 - I have 11 working guitars - I need 7 more Snarks"}
{"source": "  some have had their batteries run down in under a year - but I get close to 2 years off a new battery - ( Batteries are a bit costly)"}
{"source": "This is my second and I love them so much"}
{"source": " They work flawlessley and tune is amazing! Get one and dont hesitate"}
{"source": "Not bad, but I had intended on leaving this on my instrument"}
{"source": " I bought a few for different basses and guitars"}
{"source": " But the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag (no problem with hard cases) leaving the battery dead when I took the instrument out of the case"}
{"source": " The switch SHOULD be on the side of the unit"}
{"source": " FWIW, I like my Snarks better"}
{"source": "faster and more stable tuning"}
{"source": " A near miss with the NS"}
{"source": "When I first installed these strings I wasn't too impressed"}
{"source": "  They felt different under my fingers and the sound was much more tinny than I'm used to"}
{"source": "  However, after a month and a half of playing, I really do love these strings"}
{"source": "  I got used to the feel, the tinny sound mellowed out a little, and man do they stay in tune!Cobalt strings aren't as warm as traditional nickle strings but if you play hard rock or metal I find the gain to be more articulate"}
{"source": "  Solo's pierce through the mix without becoming too shrill and muted playing has better voicing, in my opinion"}
{"source": "  They're also super fast"}
{"source": "  I mentioned earlier that they feel different, and they do"}
{"source": "  It's not necessarily a bad different it's just slicker and not as coiled feeling"}
{"source": "  Hard to describe, but if you're used to playing nickle you'll notice the difference"}
{"source": "Honestly, my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune"}
{"source": "  I went on vacation for a week, came back, picked up the guitar, expecting to have to tune it, and every single note was dead on"}
{"source": "  As they age, you'll have to make a few minor tuning tweaks but its nowhere near as frequent as nickle"}
{"source": "These really are a good set of strings"}
{"source": "  If you try them just make sure to give them time"}
{"source": "  They get better with wear"}
{"source": "Okay"}
{"source": " just strung these up and ran them through three different amps and about 25 different pedals (metal, overdrive, echo, reverb, fuzz, etc)"}
{"source": "  So keep in mind that they haven't broken in yet as I do this review"}
{"source": "  But I do feel confident in what I report here"}
{"source": "They are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels"}
{"source": "  On the high gain metal muff, fullbore, guytone metal monster, swollen pickle, and big muff they sound really nice"}
{"source": " a lot of harmonics and output captured"}
{"source": " For that 5 stars easy"}
{"source": "  I don't think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold"}
{"source": "  Other's may feel differently I am sure"}
{"source": "  Then again, Ernie Ball even states they are very bight high output"}
{"source": "  So you are getting what they say"}
{"source": "However, for a warm bluesy tone I couldn't get anywhere close to my sound like I can with the pure nickels"}
{"source": "  For that 1"}
{"source": "5 star"}
{"source": "  Average to 3 I guess"}
{"source": " :)"}
{"source": "  Forget about the nickel wound steel all together (those are really lame)"}
{"source": "  Either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment"}
{"source": "  For shredding go cobalt"}
{"source": " for warm/woman tone go PURE nickels (that's PURE folks!!)"}
{"source": "  I also really like the d'addario pures"}
{"source": "Also, these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel"}
{"source": "  Hope this helps"}
{"source": "The cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling"}
{"source": " Maybe it's just me, but that's how they come across"}
{"source": " I noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel, but don't lose that new sound new as fast"}
{"source": " I didn't have near as much string stretch with these either"}
{"source": " I'll keep using them, just maybe in a different gauge"}
{"source": "Ukulele straps are a rare thing and I've yet to find the perfect one"}
{"source": "  This one gets close"}
{"source": "  Not all uke players use straps, some do and some don't"}
{"source": "  Purists say not to use one and that using one makes you look lazy or inexperienced"}
{"source": "  However I have two acoustic-electric ukes and they are heavier than the non-electrified ones the purists use"}
{"source": "  I've found that using a strap on my electric ukes helps with right arm fatigue from clutching the thing"}
{"source": "  A preamp and battery adds a surprising amount of weight percentage wise to a uke when compared to a guitar"}
{"source": "  This Neotech strap frees me up to worry about my strumming and fingering techniques more and dropping the instrument less"}
{"source": "There is another device called a Uke Leash that also works well"}
{"source": "  It ties onto the headstock"}
{"source": " I like this Neotech better because even though the instrument isn't balanced perfectly, it is balanced better than with the Uke Leash"}
{"source": "  The Uke Leash is easier to get on and off my body so it has some advantage over the Neotech Simple Sling"}
{"source": "This Neotech Simple Sling soundhole clip strap works on my Concert and Tenor ukes equally well, but I have to adjust it some when switching it between the two"}
{"source": "The wide clip is felt lined and it does not scratch the instrument"}
{"source": "  I don't know how long this felt lasts but it seems well attached"}
{"source": "  This strap should work fine on any number of various stringed instruments"}
{"source": "You have to use reasonable care with a soundhole clip strap on a ukulele or you can damage the top by jerking down on the instrument"}
{"source": "  The clip on the Neotech Sling is wider than most I've seen and this extra width reduces, but does not completely eliminate, that risk"}
{"source": " The wider clip spreads the stress out"}
{"source": "  I've seen other soundhole clip straps with much narrower clips and I'm afraid to try them on a ukulele"}
{"source": "  I like this one with the wide clip and will keep it"}
{"source": "The Uke Leash type strap that ties on the headstock still requires full right arm pressure to hold the instrument in place, so I like this Neotech soundhole clip device better"}
{"source": "The only thing I don't like about it is putting it on is a little clumsy when compared to a traditional guitar strap"}
{"source": "  But once on it is great!  You look a little dorky slipping your arm into it and then over your head and you can't do it with a hat on"}
{"source": "  It gets easier the more you do it"}
{"source": "I'd buy the Neotech Simple Sling again"}
{"source": "  I recommend it to electric ukelele players who want to use a strap but don't want to drill holes for strap buttons on their ukes"}
{"source": "  Just put it on in private because you look dorky putting it on"}
{"source": "If you bought Rocksmith 2014, and use an electric guitar, get this"}
{"source": "  The cobalt strings are picked up very well by the magnetic pickups, and in turn Rocksmith detects the strings A LOT better"}
{"source": " I had problems with the game picking up frats 12 and up"}
{"source": "  After getting these the game picks them all up now"}
{"source": "Tried these on Les Paul style with Jimmy pgae wiring harness and through four different amps and about 25 different pedals (metal, overdrive, echo, reverb, fuzz, etc)"}
{"source": " So keep in mind that they haven't broken in yet as I do this review"}
{"source": " But I do feel confident in what I report here"}

{"source": " Hope this helps"}
{"source": "Installed these on my Schecter C-1 Hellraiser"}
{"source": " I had very high hopes for these, but as with any new over-hyped technology, they failed to impress me"}
{"source": " The only good thing I have to say is the tone is good"}
{"source": " But realistically it is no where near a drastic difference to regular strings"}
{"source": " You would barely be able to hear the difference in a side by side comparison"}
{"source": " So now that I have wasted almost double the price on these it gets worse"}
{"source": " They are not silky smooth feeling as advertised"}
{"source": " If anything they feel worse than regular strings"}
{"source": " Last but not least: they are bad for frets"}
{"source": " Just like stainless strings; harder metal against nickel frets is going to wear them out real quick"}
{"source": " I don't know about anyone else but I don't want to have my guitar re-fretted every 2 years"}
{"source": "For the very miniscule difference in tone they are not worth the extra money or equipment wear and tear"}
{"source": "The best EB Slinky's I've ever used"}
{"source": " On these I use the light's--9's"}
{"source": " Even with the whammy bar they stay in tune really well"}
{"source": " I use them on all 4 of My Guitar's"}
{"source": " Two Fender American Standard's, Gibson ES-335"}
{"source": " Gibson Les Paul/ with Bigsby"}
{"source": " I always have a set in each case"}
{"source": " Try'um"}
{"source": " Ya won't regret it !!!!!"}
{"source": "kripes man"}
{"source": "the one time I go and actually buy a \"honer\" and its a \"bummer\" this thing has 3 keys off tune!! I can buy stuff 10 times better quality from Chinaand never have this kinda junk"}
{"source": " Maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and I 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan Ive never got a harp this trashy B4!"}
{"source": " all i can say is buy Merana's for tryin out buy \"suzuki\" or Swan\" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off"}
{"source": " Oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a \"Mississipi River Harp\" for only  $5"}
{"source": "oo if you have a \"Burke's\" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the Doctah has spoken! :)"}
{"source": "Not really bright enough"}
{"source": " Both bright and lower light levels are exactly the same"}
{"source": "  I would look for something else if I didn't already have this"}
{"source": "  OK for reading a small book in bed, but doesn't cover the sheet music brightly enough"}
{"source": "Cool little light, but three minor gripes: (1) the arm is of a very flexible metal coil and almost a little too flexible, (2) the battery compartment cover comes off a little easy, and (3) the light is a little on the dim side"}
{"source": " But I think it'll work well overall and I like the fact that it's so compact and portable"}
{"source": "If you've read my review of the much cheaper Hohner Old Standby Harmonica, Key of C you know that I love the Special 20"}
{"source": " It's great for beginners or experts alike"}
{"source": " Sounds great right out of the box and plays well"}
{"source": " I was able to bend notes right away with this one, while other cheaper harps take a long time (or never) to break in properly"}
{"source": " All the notes/reeds sounded good"}
{"source": " If you're serious about playing, you will be very happy to have this harmonica around"}
{"source": " I've had many different kinds over the years and this one is my favorite"}
{"source": "Easy to play"}
{"source": " Decent quality"}
{"source": " Not expensive"}
{"source": " Easy to bend"}
{"source": " Plastic comb with no recess"}
{"source": "This is the lowest level you'd want to really play the harmonica and it won't break the bank"}
{"source": "I am a \"newbie\" to the world of playing the blues harp; however, I am not a beginner to music"}
{"source": " I have played guitar fervently for the past 22 years, so I knew a little something when I thought I would try to learn the harmonica"}
{"source": " Technique is of utmost importance and I found learning how to pucker and tongue block on this instrument was effortless"}
{"source": " It sounds, for the most part, in tune and its tone is great"}
{"source": " My kids love to hear me play it! However, there is 1 \"con\" to this wonderful instrument"}
{"source": " After owning it for several days, the DRAW 2 hole went flat"}
{"source": " I researched this and found that poor technique would likely be the culprit"}
{"source": " so I worked on my technique some more"}
{"source": " To my dismay, the one note on the harmonica that allows you to bend into 2 other tones, and is considered the \"sweet spot\" of the instrument, did not work right"}
{"source": " Obviously you cannot take it back to the seller - it's not really his/her fault"}
{"source": " I am not sure how to repair it, but I feel that I should have to do so this early in the game"}
{"source": " Maybe it's my naivete' in hoping for a perfect instrument"}
{"source": " So, I took one star away because of this problematic issue"}
{"source": " Otherwise, I really like this harmonica"}
{"source": "Sounds great! Still suck at bending 3 &4"}
{"source": " A buddy of mine got one, and he's killing it on the bends"}
{"source": " we both been playing for about 3 months"}
{"source": " Great harp"}
{"source": " Will buy another if it ever wears out"}
{"source": "First real harmonica i have owned"}
{"source": " Read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many"}
{"source": " The price is right and the quality seems good too"}
{"source": " Didnt take me long to start to pick up some techniques such as bending and single/double blow/draw"}
{"source": " Still trying to get the overblow"}
{"source": " I am far from perfecting the techniques but this harp is pretty easy to bend notes on"}
{"source": " It has a good seal also"}
{"source": " Only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back"}
{"source": "I am forever meeting people who rave about this harp, but had not tried one for myself until today"}
{"source": " It is a wonderful harp, with perfect tuning, easy bend-ability, does not buzz or squeak, and belies it's reasonable sale price"}
{"source": "  I went for the Key of Bb, and love the tone, the playability and the just right feel of the instrument"}
{"source": " For anyone not yet having a Special 20, I heartily recommend it - beginner, intermediate or advanced students, or the performer on stage - this harp is simply great"}
{"source": " I am not often surprised by anything but this harp surprised me - it is not expensive at all, and sounds as good as others I have that are four times the price"}
{"source": " I am a Hohner Marine Band Special Twenty convert  - I will get a couple more to add to my ever growing box of harps"}
{"source": "I've been playing and collecting ukuleles since spring of 2010"}
{"source": "  Good news:  these Aquila strings are on most new ukuleles"}
{"source": "  Bad news:  These Aquila strings are NOT standard on some others"}
{"source": "  I was able to take off the old ones and install these in less than half-hour"}
{"source": "  (You can get a tutorial to do anything on YouTube!)  They will stretch and de-tune for a few days, but once tuned, they sound, and just perform, great"}
{"source": "  Good price, great product"}
{"source": "  Order extra to keep on hand"}
{"source": "need to learn to read, since I have bought two other sets with a wound C string,, so bought these because I was having alot of trouble with my tenor uku my wife bought for me for Xmas,,  have since made a new nut and saddle to fix ( ok bandaid ) a high third fret which also I have sanded down and now is lining up with the others"}
{"source": "If you buy a ukulele, and it does not have these strings, you should replace them with these strings"}
{"source": " Strings make a big difference in any ukulele"}
{"source": "However I have found that there are much better prices out there if you just do some basic searching"}
{"source": "  Usually I do"}
{"source": " My bad"}
{"source": "I have three uku, soprano, concert ( Love the best ) and a tenor,,  this brand of strings rocks"}
{"source": "  enjoy"}
{"source": "I admit it, my memory is getting worse and this thing does the trick"}
{"source": " Hold my tab securely so I can flip though it with ease while I'm still playing my guitar"}
{"source": " Much more professional than having a music stand and paper up on stage"}
{"source": "I had so much trouble putting this thing together and figuring out exactly how it worked that I almost sent it back"}
{"source": "But with a little trial and error, I figured it out"}
{"source": "That said, this thing is ROCK SOLID"}
{"source": " I was a bit apprehensive at the idea of suspending a $700 iPad five feet off the ground in a spring loaded plastic clip, but this thing is built like a brick house and is super strong in terms of grip"}
{"source": "Easy to adjust and holds the iPad secure"}
{"source": "  I actually have 2 iPads on one mic stand (one shows charts while the other plays backing tracks)"}
{"source": "  No issues at all and would order again"}
{"source": "I'm the lead singer in a band and I use an app on my Kindle Fire as a teleprompter, This mount does a great job of keeping the lyrics right in my face"}
{"source": " The mic stand has been knocked over a few times but the Kindle fire and mount suffered no damage"}
{"source": " The mount is easy to remove as well"}
{"source": "I've been using this for my ipad for chord sheets as I play on a weekly basis and it has been great! Being able to not have to use a music stand and having it right below me attached to the mic stand is really convenient"}
{"source": " It grips really nicely and attaches itself onto the mic stand really easily"}
{"source": " I've owned it for a while now and haven't had any problems with it"}
{"source": "I used it once, will only use it when I'm in front of it, so that, no one takes it, it works great when you're using your tablet and I use it for playing Pandora when playing in clubs, It not Djing it's DJ sound without the DJ, no offends DJ your job isn't easy, but when their isn't a DJ this helps"}
{"source": " Remember to have Wifi in order to connect to Panadora"}
{"source": "I bought this brand because I have one of their mic stand mounts (for iPhone) which I like a lot"}
{"source": "Pros:The clips did a good job holding my iPad Mini without having to remove the folio type cover (Marware Axis)"}
{"source": "Quality seems acceptable for the price, the ball swivel works well"}
{"source": "Cons:It's too heavy for my mic stands"}
{"source": "  I tried it on the boom arm and it made it top-heavy and unstable"}
{"source": "  If the boom is positioned in a very upright position it's ok, but a boom pointed up defeats the purpose!The clamp which holds the base to the stand is big and cumbersome"}
{"source": "I had high hopes for this one but it's not going to work for me"}
{"source": "  I have returned it and ordered a different ChargerCity model, the one with the lever-type mount"}
{"source": "I was a little nervous about putting my iPad on the stand, but this is a substantial and well thought out design"}
{"source": " It comes with clips that can be used for other tablets"}
{"source": " It's very nicely adjustable and I feel very confident that my iPad is safe and secure on the stand"}
{"source": "It does the job"}
{"source": " It's bulky but it works well"}
{"source": " It comes with an extra set of holders for thicker tablets (or to use the tablet while still in the case)"}
{"source": "This product has an extremely flimsy spring mechanism inside"}
{"source": "  Upon receiving mine and assembling it, it broke immediately while I was trying to mount an iPad onto it"}
{"source": "  It also has a fairly narrow angle of adjustability"}
{"source": "  The metal parts of it seemed sturdy enough but the plastic parts looked and felt brittle"}
{"source": "First time using item and it broke"}
{"source": " The round back that screws onto the mic stand broke"}
{"source": " I was really excited to have this and us it now that I transferred all my music sheet to my iPad"}
{"source": " As soon as I took it off the mic stand the round piece came off"}
{"source": " Would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review, but it only kept referring to delivery"}
{"source": " I do like the product and it did hold my iPad steady even with a leather case on"}
{"source": " Sad!"}
{"source": "I switched over to using an Android tablet for notation when playing music"}
{"source": " All of my 7&#34; tablets fit and even my larger HP Touchpad fits"}
{"source": " I ended up using an Ainol Fire as my regular tablet"}
{"source": " It would be nice if there was just a tiny bit more tilt up but it does what it is supposed to and it fits securely on the mic stand"}
{"source": "This tablet mount allows me to use my large Toshiba Thrive in live performance situations now"}
{"source": "  It makes a solid physical connection to the mic stand, I never worry about it readjusted or slipping during use"}
{"source": "Love joyo pedals"}
{"source": "  Not sure yet on the new line"}
{"source": "  They just dont feel as solid to me"}
{"source": " That being said the pedal sounds great"}
{"source": " great distortion no issues beyond my concerns regarding the light build and esp the switch"}
{"source": " time will tell"}
{"source": "I am a confessed and unrepentant hoarder of dirtboxes and I like this pedal a lot"}
{"source": "  This is my 5th Joyo pedal- I already own the Ultimate Drive, Vintage Overdrive, Crunch Distortion, and Octive Fuzz pedals"}
{"source": "  I consider Joyo and the Dano Cool Cat line to be some of the best values in stomp-boxes these days"}
{"source": "  You've already heard the particulars about this pedal, so I won't go into the features"}
{"source": "  The build quality does appear to be a hair shoddier than all my other Joyo pedals (which are earlier versions)"}
{"source": "  The switch seems a little less heavy-duty, and the case seems to be thinner metal"}
{"source": "  That said, the case is still metal and isn't going to fail in any way"}
{"source": "  The switch- well, we will have to wait and see"}
{"source": "  For $35 or so, I'm not going to complain"}
{"source": "  Soundwise, this product offers excellent gain for this price level"}
{"source": "  It's not particularly suited for Pantera, but you can do modern mid-gain up to Metallica without any problems"}
{"source": "  This is not an overdrive, so it doesn't do the 'just on the verge of breakup' thing like a tubescreamer does"}
{"source": "  That's not what it was designed to do"}
{"source": "  I run it into a cleanish tube amp and it sounds very good"}
{"source": "  I've also boosted it with the following with a good result:  SD Pickup Booster, Cool Cat Transparent Overdrive, Tubescreamer (TS9,Joyo Vintage OD, Behringer TO800), Tech 21 Comptortion"}
{"source": "  If you play rock/ hard rock through a single channel amp (like a Blues Jr, Valve Jr or Pro Jr) and you want to make it a two channel amp, this will get you there"}
{"source": " Most people compare this pedal to the Suhr Riot"}
{"source": "  I do not own that pedal, so I can not fairly make a comparison"}
{"source": "  I have seen several videos comparing the two and as far as that is concerned, I hear enough similarity that I am not compelled to shell out $200 for the Riot"}
{"source": " Another comparison that gets made is that the US Dream is close to a ProCo RAT"}
{"source": "  I own an original 80s RAT and I don't think they are all that similar"}
{"source": "  The US Dream has a tighter low end and more treble"}
{"source": "  Not better or worse- just different enough that they don't completely cover the same sonic territory"}
{"source": "  Admitedly, I don't own a newer RAT-  maybe that one is closer to the US Dream"}
{"source": "  For what they are charging, this is another home run for Joyo-"}
{"source": "This Joyo JF-34 US dream distortion box is very well made and produces a good range of distortion effect"}
{"source": " My son has taken up playing guitar about a year or so ago and now that he is past the basics he was interested in trying different techniques"}
{"source": " This box can be set to make minimal distortion or maxed out to produce very heavily distorted effects"}
{"source": "The box is very good quality, with nice large controls and metal foot switch"}
{"source": " The unit can be powered with a 9v battery or via an external power source (not included)"}
{"source": "This is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players"}
{"source": "Highly Recommended!CFHNote: Manufacturer provided unit for review but that in no way influences my rating or comments"}
{"source": "this pedal is simple"}
{"source": "i own 4 or 5 joyo overdrive pedals ,"}
{"source": "i love them all"}
{"source": "they all differ somewhat,,,,i fell in love with this one the most,"}
{"source": ",set volume and gain to maximum loudness that you desire,,,then back off your guitar volume and it cleans up wonderfully"}
{"source": "and when you are ready to wail, just turn up your guitar volume"}
{"source": ",,,,and whammo,"}
{"source": "its a very non-colored sounding overdrive"}
{"source": ",,its hard to call it any particualr sound"}
{"source": "its just really good and clear and powerful"}
{"source": "I realized I didn't have any distortion pedals, only a bunch of overdrive pedals, so I set out to find a distortion pedal"}
{"source": "  After scouring the forums I find out the pedals that are supposed to be very good are also very pricey"}
{"source": "  Since I don't want to spend a bunch of money I get this one and it is great, albeit quite bright"}
{"source": "  The only thing I don't like about this pedal is the brightness, which can be tamed with the tone knob, otherwise it is easy to use, sounds really good and is transparent"}
{"source": " Transparent in that it doesn't add a lot of color to your amp just distortion"}
{"source": "  I use this pedal with vintage Fender Silverface amps, which are already bright, so I turn the tone more to the bass side and also shape my tone with the Spark Booster that I have in front of the US Dream"}
{"source": " I have to use the Spark Booster to hit the US Dream hard because most of the guitars I use don't have hot enough pickups"}
{"source": "The price was right, I'm happy with it"}
{"source": "This review is on the seller Yorozuya Yokoshima ,not the product"}
{"source": " These people posted what seemed like a good price (not ridiculously low) on the Us Dream pedal"}
{"source": " It was to be shipped from Japan"}
{"source": " They then decided the price was an error and canelled my order"}
{"source": " This kind of crap makes me wanna stop shopping on Amazon"}
{"source": "com because the item was less than $4"}
{"source": "00 under the next best posted price and these 3rd party sellers Yorozuya Yokoshima were afraid they wouldn't make a killing on the item"}
{"source": " I am thoroughly disgusted with this sort of behavior"}
{"source": " I lost a lot of faith in the whole process of buying online over this incident"}
{"source": "Reputedly the Joyo Us Dream is a copy of the Suhr Riot distortion pedal"}
{"source": " After watching a side by side comparison on Youtube, I decided to buy one"}
{"source": "I would describe the Us Dream as sounding like a bright Proco Rat with a little less sustain and a much tighter low end"}
{"source": " It has an MXR style enclosure (that means you have to remove the back plate to change batteries) and a surprisingly narrow sweet spot"}
{"source": " But for $48 dollars I'm  happy with purchase"}
{"source": "Dirt box gold for under 50 bucks! Highly adjustable tone, volume and distortion level that won't tank your amplifier tone, while letting you get between everything from back alley blues to blistering metal"}
{"source": " I love this pedal!!! The true bypass is a bonus if you are in love with your amp's tone, but lose it when you engage your pedal"}
{"source": " Not anymore"}
{"source": " I know there are some great distortion pedals on the market, but you won't find this quality and tone at a better price"}
{"source": " Joyo win"}
{"source": "Sorry OS-2 - it's pawnshop time for you!"}
{"source": "The US Dream is supposed \"clone\" of the Suhr Riot, and is the only one of the \"new\" model Joyo pedals that I own"}
{"source": "  This is a high-gain distortion pedal that covers the gain range of something like a ProCo Rat, but retains its clarity even at higher gain settings"}
{"source": "When I first pulled it out of the box and plugged in, it sounded great, but I wondered if it might be a little bright"}
{"source": "  I was pleasantly surprised when I rolled back the tone knob to around 10 o'clock, and it rolled off the harsh high end while retaining clarity and fullness"}
{"source": "  At least with my setup (Les Paul into a Vox Valvetronix 40-watt), this is one of the few distortion pedals capable of full-sounding power chords and singing high leads"}
{"source": "  Unlike some distortion pedals that have a \"fizzy\" (DS-1) or \"cocked wah\" sound (Boss Power Stack), I was really pleased with the tone all over the neck of my guitar"}
{"source": "While Joyo makes several dozen effects pedals at good prices, this is one of the first three I would recommend, along with the outstanding Ultimate Drive and the warm-sounding Vintage Overdrive"}

{"source": "  The weight is comparable to an MXR '78 Badass Distortion, except the switch and output jacks are more suspect"}
{"source": "  Still, if a pedal SOUNDS great and has yet to fail on me, I refuse to trash it in review until something on it actually fails me"}

{"source": " A Boss SD-1 or Digitech Bad Monkey are far better options for this price range"}
{"source": "I just received this a day ago and bought it on whim after being very impressed with the Joyo Crunch Pedal"}
{"source": "  This is (I think) based on a very expensive sweet honey drive pedal"}
{"source": "  It's supposed to be very reactive to your playing"}
{"source": "  Dig in and it puts out distortion, play soft and it cleans up"}
{"source": "  This is much more noticeable the cleaner you run your amp"}
{"source": "  I can say it's pretty reactive and feels like a very responsive tube screamer"}
{"source": "  I've heard some say they find the distortion from this pedal a little harsh but I find is wonderfully smooth with some grit"}
{"source": "  I found it really warmed up my sound in a good way"}
{"source": "  I'm playing an american strat with noisless Dimarzio Area pickups through a Vox AC15 and it's an awesome combo"}
{"source": "  I put this pedal in front of my OCD and I was really getting some sweet tones"}
{"source": "  If I had to play out with just my amp and one pedal for a little dirt this might win over my OCD"}
{"source": "  It's expensive for a Joyo but cheap for a really good OD stomp"}
{"source": "  It's definitely not for metal or heavier distortion stuff but it's got plenty on tap for blues and classic rock"}
{"source": "  So far I've been super pleased by Joyo pedals"}
{"source": "  The jury is still out on how well they hold but but they sure sound and perform pretty darn well"}
{"source": "I've owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one I still have on my pedal board is the Boss Super Overdrive"}
{"source": "Sweet Baby is well on the way of living up to that legend as well"}
{"source": " I have nothing but high praise for this amazing pedal"}
{"source": " It really does react to your playing style"}
{"source": " Unlike other overdrive pedals I've used this one really gets smooth when you back off of your string attack and starts to growl the harder you dig in"}
{"source": " As far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of them"}
{"source": "instead of a tone knob they call it \"focus\", there is also a volume and drive knob"}
{"source": " The sounds I can get out of the Sweet Baby are some of the best I've ever used and easy to dial in"}
{"source": " I own a lot of pedals but lately I keep my chain setup real simple"}
{"source": "the guitar goes into a EHX-Crying Tone wah pedal, then the Sweet Baby, then a Boss Super Overdrive (used as a lead solo gain boost"}
{"source": " I don't use Distortion pedals"}
{"source": "), next is an MXR Micro Chorus followed by an MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay"}
{"source": " The whole chain goes into the 2nd channel of my Fender Deluxe Reverb amp"}
{"source": " I use the foot switch that came with amp to turn on the tremolo when needed"}
{"source": " I play mostly Blues and Classic Rock"}
{"source": " The Sweet Baby is well made and I don't see it failing me anytime soon"}
{"source": " You can spend hundreds more on name brand pedals but what works for me at the end of the day is alive and well in this \"clone\" overdrive tone blender"}
{"source": "Update: this pedal has since been returned"}
{"source": " It went out with me on a few gigs and didn't hold up to life on the road"}
{"source": " The connections inside the box came loose and became a major problem before a few gigs"}
{"source": "I have since put my Boss Super Overdrive back in the chain"}
{"source": "while I truly loved the tone from this product in the end you get what you pay for"}
{"source": "If you don't like too much dirt in your tone, this might be the pedal for you"}
{"source": "The Sweet Baby is a low gain overdrive pedal that is also on the bright side tonally"}
{"source": "If you have a fairly clean single channel amp, it won't give you the full crunch or theextra sustain specially at low bedroom levels"}
{"source": "  However, if you set your tube amp towhere it just starts to break up or is already cooking, step on this pedal and you'll be rewarded"}
{"source": " If you like the sound of the dirt channel on your amp, set the gain low and boost it with this pedal"}
{"source": " The notes ring clear with the extra bite, and brightness to cut thru the mix"}
{"source": "sweet! You can use it like a Tubescreamer although the Sweet Baby doesn't color your sound"}
{"source": "  (No mid-hump)I use it to boost my Barber Direct Drive, OCD and the dirt channel on my amp"}
{"source": "The pedal is housed in a metal casing and looks well made"}
{"source": "  It's not noisy even when you stack it with other overdrives"}
{"source": "  Instead of a tone knob, it has a \"focus knob\" which controls your picking dynamics and presence"}
{"source": "  All the way to the left, the sound is smooth with a tone that sounds like you turned off the presence control on your amp"}
{"source": "  All the way to the right, when you pick the strings hard, it gives you that bite as well as the brighter presence"}
{"source": "  The pedal is very transparent, smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well"}
{"source": "You can't get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with"}
{"source": "This pedal basically takes the sound of your amp, adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control"}
{"source": "  I just wish it had more gain so you can go from blues to hard driving rock with a twist of a knob"}
{"source": "  At a fraction of the cost of the boutique pedal it was patterned after, it's a no brainer"}
{"source": "Wow"}
{"source": "  I have been impressed with a lot of Joyo's products, but their Sweet Baby Overdrive was one that came highly recommended, and hasn't disappointed"}
{"source": "  I held off a little bit until the price came down, but the truth is that this thing is worth every penny it's sold for, and then some"}
{"source": "As the description says, this is a \"mild overdrive\""}
{"source": "  It won't give you the \"Brown Sound\""}
{"source": "  It's not meant for metal"}
{"source": "  It's almost like adding a tube-amp \"gain\" knob to your existing rig, add subtle yet dynamic saturation and sustain to an otherwise clean tone"}
{"source": "  Chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out"}
{"source": "  Unlike many \"tube\" overdrive pedals, this thing has tons of volume on tap"}
{"source": "  You can set the \"Drive\" to 0 and still have a nice loud clean boost"}
{"source": "  Turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock"}
{"source": "  But I think of it more as an enhancement to your clean tone, as opposed to an \"effect\" that transforms it"}
{"source": "  In that respect, it actually reminds me of the BOSS OD-3 Overdrive, which is a vastly underrated pedal (though the OD-3 probably offers more gain)"}
{"source": "The Focus knob is interesting - it doesn't act exactly like a tone knob"}
{"source": "  As you turn it up, it doesn't remove bass, but changes the gain structure a little and opens up the tone"}
{"source": "  The lower settings are bluesy - the higher settings are bright and dynamic"}
{"source": "  But chances are, both will sound good"}
{"source": "There are some concerns you could have about the build quality - the switch may not be built to last 20 years, and having to remove 4 screws to get to the 9V jack is annoying"}
{"source": "  I also wish they'd put the 9V adapter jack on top instead of the side"}
{"source": "  But those are mostly minor gripes"}
{"source": "  It's an excellent overdrive and an incredible value"}
{"source": "Very transparent, with great sustain and a hint of &#34;dirty&#34; boost if you crank the knobs to max"}
{"source": "Built well, sounds good and does what you'd expect"}
{"source": "Let me just start out by saying that I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time"}
{"source": " I still own most of these units except for this one"}
{"source": "the JoYo compressor"}
{"source": " My setup is a very simple one"}
{"source": "starting with a Stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato"}
{"source": " I don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals I've tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them"}
{"source": " This thing simply didn't work right out of the box"}
{"source": " While the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from China"}
{"source": " Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board"}
{"source": " I ended up sending it back for a full refund"}
{"source": " I don't in anyway blame the seller"}
{"source": " They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them again"}
{"source": "just nothing with the name JoYo on it"}
{"source": " If you're only buying these based on price I would say buyer beware"}
{"source": "you get what you pay for"}
{"source": "I've had this for almost a year"}
{"source": " While I'm no stranger to compression as far as recording and pro audio goes, I haven't used a compressor pedal since Washburn made that really janky, noisy compressor pedal in the late 80's"}
{"source": " I have never used a Ross, so the fact that this is supposedly a clone didn't have any influence over my decision to buy the Joyo"}
{"source": " I will say that it's not a pedal that should be reviewed the first time you use it"}
{"source": " Sure, I love to love my gear right out of the box just like others do, but compression takes time to dial in, even if you are familiar with it"}
{"source": " That said, I finally love this pedal and feel that I can accurately say that it has made a tremendous improvement in keeping my signal tamed when going from clean to overdrive/distortion"}
{"source": " I bought it mainly because I play in a Rush cover band, and the harmonics at the beginning and end of Red Barchetta sounded flat and lifeless until I got the Joyo dialed in"}
{"source": " Compression isn't the easiest effect to dial in, but once you're there, you can pretty much leave it set as long as you're using similar pickups if you happen to switch guitars"}
{"source": " Great pedal once you get it dialed in"}
{"source": " Take your time and you will probably be as happy with it as I am"}
{"source": "It seems to do nothing as an effect and draws power reducing the volume on your instrument as well as the amp"}
{"source": "  Not sure if it is just a broken pedal or if it is just junk"}
{"source": " When received the package did not appear to be damaged, but I have tried it on 3 different amps and i get the same results regardless of the amp or the instrument"}
{"source": "As thrilled as I have been with the Chinese-made Joyo overdrive and distortion pedals I've tried out in the recent past, I felt like the JF-10 Dyna Compressor was somewhat of a risk"}
{"source": "  I had been using the very excellent MXR Custom Comp already, but was frustrated with its lack of external controls and versatility"}
{"source": "  Also, it's one thing thing for Joyo to \"clone\" the circuitry of a distortion pedal, but could they do it accurately with an \"always on\" effect like compression?Well, Joyo has absolutely done it, and they've done it well enough that I'm selling my MXR"}
{"source": "  Compressors are hard to explain, and even harder to demonstrate on a YouTube video, so let me offer my explanation of what this pedal does, and why you should give it a try for only around $40"}
{"source": "The primary effect of compression is to \"level\" or normalize the output across frequencies"}
{"source": "  Particularly with a clean signal, aggressive playing can lead to annoying volume swells"}
{"source": "  Also, certain notes sustain, while others seem to die out too early"}
{"source": "  Compression \"smooths\" over these problems and levels everything to a polished, presentable sound"}
{"source": "The secondary effect of compression is that the pedal can sustain single notes and chords by increasing their level after they would normally die out"}
{"source": "  In this area, the Joyo JF-10 is superior to many other compressors because it gives you \"Attack\" and \"Sustain\" knobs"}
{"source": "  \"Attack\" refers to how soon the compression effect kicks after the note is struck"}
{"source": "  Turning the knob up produces a \"chicken picking\" effect where the note is very clear and pronounced"}
{"source": "  Adjusting the \"Sustain\" knob, obviously, increases the length of time that the note or chord continues to play at volume"}
{"source": "  Like most compressors, there is also a \"Level\" control to change the volume of the compressed sound"}
{"source": "Of the compressors you can actually find under $100 (such as the MXR Dyna Comp and BOSS CS-3 Compression Sustainer), I like this one the best"}
{"source": "  The MXR models have a good clarity of tone, but with only two knobs, the lack of customization is a problem"}
{"source": "  You may want high sustain or attack for playing U2-type guitar parts, but might find excess sustain too \"messy\" for punchy AC/DC riffs"}
{"source": "  The Joyo allows you to make this change easily"}
{"source": "The BOSS CS-3 is a good pedal that has controls for attack, sustain, and also tone, but the pedal produces a lot of noise, and the resulting tone sounds too digitized"}
{"source": "  Also, a \"tone\" knob on a compression pedal strikes me as an admission that the pedal is CHANGING your tone, which good compression really shouldn't do"}
{"source": "  The Joyo Dyna Compressor sounds like MY guitar and amp, it just puts some polish on the final product, and allows me to add sustain and \"punch\" if I see fit"}
{"source": "  Great pedal, and amazing value!"}
{"source": "I have a love/hate relationship with compressors"}
{"source": " For $40"}
{"source": "00, you can't go wrong with this one"}
{"source": " I use it a lot on my practice rig"}
{"source": " If you need a top notch compressor, hands down the Keeley 4 knob"}
{"source": " I use a Keeley in my live shows"}
{"source": " Expensive but worth it"}
{"source": " As for this Joyo, I can't complain"}
{"source": " It does it's job pretty good but it does color your tone some what"}
{"source": " True bypass is nice, it's noticeable in your chain, but not to much to take it out"}
{"source": " I love for my practice rig"}
{"source": " Good buy if you're on a budget (all us musicians are) just don't expect to blown away by it"}
{"source": " For $40- give it a shot, I did and don't regret it :)"}
{"source": "EQ is great but good luck changing the battery - Lid is too small (or I just have big hands - LOL"}
{"source": "I like the amount of frequencies available for adjustments- I run this through a Furman pedal board and there is little to no noise - for the money this is a good product-"}
{"source": "Alright, it was $30 not $130 - I already had a pretty low expectation bar so would say it gets the job done but not the most &#34;sound-sculpting&#34; investment you could make"}
{"source": " As a mid range, lead boost it serves a very practical purpose though"}
{"source": "true bypass, doesnt color your sound at all when turned offzero noise, none at allvery useable bands, and useable amounts of gain50+ years as a gigging guitaristmy ears have always liked a lot of midsunfortunately, most amps and modelers consider &#34;mids&#34; to be a much higher frequency than what i consider mids to bei love a nice &#34;bump&#34; in the 800 mhz frequency and this pedal delivers that perfectly"}
{"source": "great pedal at a great price"}
{"source": "The Joyo pedal looks kool and has some kool features but those are the main pros"}
{"source": " Ive never been a big fuzz kind of player but i figured its only $40 so why not? The first thing i learned about this pedal is It does what it's suppose to do but with some drawbacks"}
{"source": " There is veryyy loud feedback through the pedal"}
{"source": " If you go this pedal and didnt have a noise suppresser you'd be up the creek"}
{"source": " Although it is a fuzz pedal is it does \"fuzz\" things then that's why I give it 4 stars"}
{"source": " I deduct 1 star because the loud feedback"}
{"source": " But in the long run I would just check other pedal out and look for a better alternative"}
{"source": "This pedal sort of let me down a bit"}
{"source": "I really cannot find a musical sounding adjustment,I can hear a small amount of octave when I adjust it but it is mostly a fuzz pedal with a mid range cut switch"}
{"source": "If this was more of an octave pedal I would have been entirely more into the way it sounds"}
{"source": "I kept it because to be honest it is very cheap"}
{"source": "Why bother sending it back? It is a very good paper weight and I have even used it as a hammer and pounded nails in with it"}
{"source": "Lets face it,If someone breaks into my house I can whack them on the head with it and knock them out"}
{"source": "I just cannot get any octave sounds idk am I missing something? Joyo I like your other pedal but this one makes me want to punch your entire company in the mouth"}
{"source": "I got this from a \"direct from china\" vendor"}
{"source": "  When it arrived the volume pot was not working"}
{"source": "  It would only operate at about the first 1/4 of travel and then die off"}
{"source": "  I was ready to give up but on the second day it just started working(???)"}
{"source": "  So I don't know if it's a fair representation of these pedals"}
{"source": "  I have two other fuzz's(Swollen Pickle & MXR 108 Classic Fuzz)"}
{"source": "  To me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed"}
{"source": "  The Octave feature is a little useless for anything other than lead work and the mid-cut makes it a bit nasal sounding"}
{"source": "  Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty cool pedal but it's not as nice to my ears as my other two fuzz pedals"}
{"source": "  But those pedals are about $100+ so if you just want to play around with a fuzz pedal this might do the trick"}
{"source": "  But do buy from a local vender in case you get a lemon"}
{"source": "  All in all I think if you really want a quality fuzz pedal you might be better off somewhere else"}
{"source": "  I own a few other joyo pedals that I love but to me this one is just OK"}
{"source": "For the price, this is an amazing pedal"}
{"source": " The sound from a $40 pedal is outstanding, much better than I ever expected"}
{"source": "The Voodoo is a fuzz pedal, meant to give a sort of Jimi Hendrix sound"}
{"source": " This pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave"}
{"source": " Alone it does a decent job of transforming my guitar into something like Hendrix"}
{"source": " I was able to hold a note for two minutes with this box, the sustain is big"}
{"source": " All was not completely perfect, it might be me and the way I'm adjusting this, but I had a bit of trouble with feedback"}
{"source": "From a sound standpoint, this is a great value and does a good job of fuzzing up my sound"}

{"source": " The pots look really good"}
{"source": " For this pedal, they went with press on knobs"}
{"source": " If the knob ever breaks, they are a very easy replacement at Radio Shack"}
{"source": " The only weak point is the somewhat thin Mid Cut toggle switch"}
{"source": " Given that it is between three knobs, I think it would be hard to break this switch - but it is a little lighter weight than I would like"}
{"source": "The pedal comes with a 9 Volt battery"}

{"source": "This is not a high end pedal, at this price point, nobody should ever expect that"}
{"source": " But darn it, this is one amazingly nice pedal when I consider price"}
{"source": " Well worth the investment"}
{"source": "The GateShop provided me with a sample of this pedal for review"}
{"source": "This one sounds a bit nasal, and thin on guitar"}
{"source": " I tried it on bass, and it gives you that big raw, ad thick stoner metal bass sound"}

{"source": "  The Mahalo has the most \"island\" look to my eyes and the best sound"}

{"source": " My 66 had thin frets"}
{"source": " With the medium jumbo frets they are sufficiently high, that if you check them once fretting a note with something as accurate as the Snark SN 2 All Instrument Clip on Chromatic Tuner you will see that the note moves up one or two bars on the tuner once you fret it"}
{"source": " (That is one or two bar above the note you are then fretting) So I must admit my quest for the perfect capo would enable me to adjust it so that the guitar doesn't go out of tune when using a capo"}

{"source": " So I sent it back"}
{"source": " So now it comes down to the Shubb 1 Deluxe and the Planet Waves"}
{"source": " I went back and forth with these two tuners a whole lot of times"}

{"source": "The Schubb S1 had the ability to be adjusted so fine that it would barely be holding on to the neck"}

{"source": " So that is the last thing that you want to happen in the middle of a performance"}
{"source": " The Planet Waves Capo in contrast, even at the lightest setting, was still a solid grip on the neck"}

{"source": " Most people wouldn't even bother with that much of an adjustment but I know that there is nothing to compare to a guitar with good strings on it, and to hear the tone and the blend of those strings in perfect tune; perfect harmony rules"}
{"source": " You know that feeling when you come to the end of a great song, and you hit your last note and finish with a full chord that is perfectly in tune; there is nothing to compare to it"}
{"source": "The planet wave is a little bit bulkier and if I had to get critical of it I would say it does get in the way a tiny bit more than the Schubb S1; although this factor is not such a great difference, as to preclude me choosing one over the other"}
{"source": " The way each of them mount and dismount to the guitar does make me lean more strongly to the Planet Waves"}
{"source": "I saw other reviews that commented that one type of capo provided a better tone than another type of capo"}
{"source": " Tried as I might I could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of"}
{"source": " There are so many factors affecting the tone, such as after changing the capo was a guitar body leaning a little bit more one way, then it was the last time"}
{"source": " For example was the face of the guitar a little closer to the ear range as compared to the last capo you tested that might've been projecting more from the side of the guitar"}
{"source": " I also felt that once the capo squeezes the string down the only thing that is creating tone is the fret line between it and the bridge"}
{"source": " So at least between these two I found no total differences"}
{"source": "I wanted to say that if you are using medium sized jumbo frets and high action you are really bending the string in order to fret it thereby changing the pitch"}
{"source": " I love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings"}
{"source": " I'd rather dance across the top like a ballet dancer then scrub heavy gauge strings"}
{"source": " To each his own they say"}
{"source": " I just consider it important to let you know that I'm conducting this experiment with 8 gauge strings on the Tele electric and 9 gauge on the acoustic"}
{"source": " So if you're running a much heavier gauge string with lower action, you would of course have less tuning shift going on, because you could adjust the capo (and both of these have a round adjusting knob for fine-tuning) and be able to adjust it to the point where you are pressing just beyond the level of the frets and not really squeezing it all the way down on the fret board and therefore have less of a challenge in trying to keep it in tune while using a capo"}
{"source": " (Although I doubt many are setting it that way but rather squeezing it down to the fret board instead"}
{"source": ") Although it is possible with heavy gauge strings that you can fine tune the pressure sufficiently that it will yield a tuned instrument while under the load of the heavier gauge strings creating a strong enough grip at this finer setting so it won't slide off of the guitar like the Shubb does at its lighter setting"}
{"source": "Of course all this is predicated upon you not re-tuning the guitar when you change the capo position"}
{"source": " That really is the only way to create a perfectly tuned instrument and that is to do a little tweaking when you change the capo position"}
{"source": " I'm sure most people ignore that and consider the ever so slightly out of tune instrument is something that is not objectionable and doesn't impede the overall quality of their performance"}
{"source": " I find on the other hand, that a guitar which is perfectly in tune takes the music to a level that is not possible no matter how little or much it is out of tune"}
{"source": "So I conclusion I find the planet waves easier-to-use and with its longer arm capable of a wider fret board, while at the same time capable of the thinner fret boards as well, as being the one that I highly recommend"}
{"source": " Notwithstanding the Shubb places a very close second, and with its slightly smaller size, it does in fact get in the way a little less than the Planet Waves"}
{"source": " All in all they both are the best of all the ones I've tried"}
{"source": "I use a variety of guitars, from an old '50s gibson acoustic to a new nylon string acoustic"}
{"source": " I expected the capo to work well on the narrower neck Gibson, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked well on the 2-inch nut width guitars as well"}
{"source": " It has a spring-loaded clamping arm that can have the clamping strength increased or decreased, and this works well"}
{"source": " Above the adjustable clamping device is a narrow slit to hold a guitar pick, and there's also a holder for a tuner"}
{"source": " I use neither of these, so I have no comment on their usability"}
{"source": " But for my use the capo is thoughtfully engineered, and is an excellent product"}
{"source": "I've had my eye on a G7th capo for awhile, but this became available in the Vine program so I decided to try it"}
{"source": "The capo was easy to pop out of the package"}
{"source": " The design is simple and easy to understand and use"}
{"source": " It is very lightweight and works fine on my Epiphone electric guitar"}
{"source": " The capo also has a handy built-in pick holder"}
{"source": "This capo certainly meets my needs, and I've removed the G7th from my wish list"}
{"source": "I have been using an old elastic-bar capo for years because the last spring capo I used did not have nearly enough tension"}
{"source": " When I first applied the Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo I thought \"here we go again"}
{"source": "\" There was ample tension E-G but B and E were buzzy as all get out"}
{"source": " Not expecting much, I adjusted the tension"}
{"source": " It took a couple of tries to get it just right, but now the capo works as if it was made specifically for my guitar"}
{"source": " zero buzz across the board"}
{"source": " That in and of itself, makes this capo a five in my book"}
{"source": " Add in the facts that the release mechanism is a breeze (on and off), it looks nice (I have the black version), as well as its comparative ease on the wallet, and this capo is a rock solid five star product"}
{"source": "This capo also has a pick holder"}
{"source": " The feature can actually be a little awkward because of its placement in the context of the capo's overall size and shape, but it is there if you need it and it does not detract from the functionality of the capo itself"}
{"source": "Get this capo!"}
{"source": "I did some research on capos and decided to give Planet Waves a try"}
{"source": " I previously had one of those bungie cord like capos, which was fine but it is a bit cumbersome"}
{"source": "The other capos I looked into were Kyser and Schubb"}
{"source": " Kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip"}
{"source": " It's disadvantage however is that it has a lot of weighted tension on one side so it can knock your strings out of tune"}
{"source": " The Schubb deals with this issue by having an adjustable tension spring that will adjust pressure according to the thickness of the neck"}
{"source": " The problem with the Schubb, however, is that it can't really be manipulated with one hand and it can easily fall of the guitar"}
{"source": "In comes the Planet Waves"}
{"source": " It has a trigger grip so technically you can easily move it around the fretboard"}
{"source": " However, because of the adjustable tension, you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness"}
{"source": " It might rule out the one-handed ease but it does take care of Schubb's problem of falling off"}
{"source": " In reality, I only found that I need to adjust the tension when switching between guitars or if I move up way up the fretboard"}
{"source": " Between the 1st and 5th fret, I don't really need adjust"}
{"source": " However, if for some reason I want to capo at the 7th, I do need to adjust the tension because it's too tight"}
{"source": " In all, it's not that big a deal and it's nice to have the option to adjust the capo"}
{"source": "In all, I'm happy"}
{"source": " No capo is perfect"}
{"source": " You can do partial capos with this one"}
{"source": " Another review complained that it created buzz but all you need to do it adjust the tension"}
{"source": "In case you aren't aware, this particular capo model only works on six string steel guitars"}
{"source": " I have an electric guitar, a nylon and a Recording King ROS-06 with a chunky neck"}
{"source": " Works great on the electric with the skinny neck and the ROS-06 with that chunky neck"}
{"source": " Since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard, it does not work on classical guitars (or anything with a flat fretboard)"}
{"source": " The capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved, it will not apply pressure on the middle strings"}
{"source": "It's a nice capo but it may not be what you're looking for so I recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos"}

{"source": "  I know I'm happy"}
{"source": "BOTTOM LINE: The Orange Micro Terror is powerful hybrid amp head capable of driving any number of speakers you throw at it"}
{"source": " It's low wattage guarantees crushing tube overdrive and classic British tones in the palm of your hand"}
{"source": "WHY ONLY 3 STARS? For starters, this is what I would consider a \"novelty-boutique amplifier\", because it recreates vintage British sounds like a boss, but it's lack of clean headroom is evident"}
{"source": " It's an Orange after all, and so if you want a dirty Plexi sound with only 1-channel to work with - this head is for you"}
{"source": " Playing with a Les Paul, I tested it through a Marshall 1960A 4x12 and it sounds amazing"}
{"source": " I also tested it through my custom 1x12 cabinet loaded with a Celestion G12H30"}
{"source": " I was able to find the \"sweet spot\" on the Tone knob, which for me was around 1 o'clock, and with the Volume at noon and the Drive at max"}
{"source": " I had entered a very musical, lush, and totally gig-worthy tone zone that Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, and Jimmy Page would have loved to go on tour with"}
{"source": " However, as much as I love eating British Crunch for breakfast, I consider myself a versatile player who needs a bright and heady clean channel AND that classic punch'n'crunch we all know and love AND a solid distortion for metal and beyond"}
{"source": " Unfortunately, the Micro Terror is a ONE TRICK PONY in the Tone category, and for this (if we're starting at 5 stars) I have to subtract one star"}
{"source": " I feel confident subtracting a star for tone because the Micro Terror doesn't exactly take pedals well either without generating too much noise, which leads to feedback"}
{"source": " I subtract another star because this head is really only usable if you're in a rock band, already own a 2x12 or 4x12, and want something quick and small to use to rock out with"}
{"source": " The problem is, if you're one of those people, you probably already have a solid amp head to drive that 2x12 or 4x12 in the first place"}
{"source": " This puts the Micro Terror into Secondary status or useful as an emergency head during a gig if things take a turn for the worse"}
{"source": " This leads me to my final point: if the intent is to purchase this as a bedroom practice or garage rehearsal head, then for the price you could get a much better product that has two GOOD channels instead of one simple (but GREAT) one"}
{"source": "WHAT I LOVE about the Micro Terror is that it is something you can always keep in your arsenal"}
{"source": " Having owned several different combo amps and head/cabinet variations over the years, the Micro Terror could fill that niche because it can be scaled according to your performance or rehearsal needs"}
{"source": " If I were starting over from scratch, I'd probably buy two 2x12 cabs, a Micro Terror, and a bigger and more powerful tube head to drive both cabs if needed"}
{"source": " This would give you perfect flexibility for band rehearsal, studio recording, small bar, big bar, club, or concert stage venues"}
{"source": "(TO THOSE WHO THINK THIS REVIEW WAS UNHELPFUL: I've noticed this review, and pretty much any review of this amp with anything bad to say about it is getting unhelpful votes"}
{"source": " It seems like, people want this to be a 5-Star Amp but always with the caveat of \"but it's $150, what do you expect?\" or they begin their rave review with \"For a $150 amp"}
{"source": "\""}
{"source": " Look, I don't judge gear just by price, I judge it by VALUE and with my EARS first"}
{"source": " The reality is, you need a really nice 1x12, 2x12, or 4x12 to really make the Micro Terror sound amazing"}
{"source": " If you're dropping $150 for the Terror, and probably another $150~$250 for a great cab"}
{"source": " why not spend that $300 or so on a great ALL-tube 1x12 to begin with with 2 channels, better EQ, and the option to route to an external cab from the get-go?)"}
{"source": "I have checked this amp out twice, once with an orange ppc112 and once with the 8&#34; version, with both a Strat and a Les Paul, and I am very disappointed in this amp"}
{"source": "Now admittedly, with the high output buckers on the les paul the pre-amp breaks up nicely and the tone is really sweet with the gain on 5-7, however the bottom line is that there is simply not enough clean headroom in this amp to produce any worthwhile volume with clean or mild crunch tones"}
{"source": "So, without any volume with clean tones this amp becomes a one trick pony and hence so very very disappointing"}
{"source": "Bottom line: unless you want full on distortion 100% of the time, you are better off with a clean amp and distortion pedal than this gutless amp"}
{"source": " if you are committed to Orange (and boy do they make some stunning amps) go check out the dark terror"}
{"source": "This is a very cheap little practice amp, and I hoped I'd be able to use it with the headphone port and aux in to practice without driving my GF nuts"}
{"source": " Unfortunately I have a couple of problems:  the headphone and aux quality really wasn't that great (and using great phones)"}
{"source": "  The sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier"}
{"source": " I just expected this to be a little more versatile than it turned out to be"}
{"source": "For quiet practice, you're best getting a VOX Amplug, IMHO"}

{"source": " It has settings for chromatic, bass, guitar, and ukulele"}
{"source": " Not only does it have tone dial indicator, but the screen changes color, red for flat, green for just right, yellow for sharp"}
{"source": " The screen is also very bright and easy to read"}
{"source": " It is very sensitive, no need to constantly move it around like with the Snark SN 1"}
{"source": " It is tiny, perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse"}
{"source": " I use mine for when I go to the music store and test out ukuleles"}
{"source": " This makes a perfect main tuner, or a nice inexpensive backup to more expensive tuners"}
{"source": " My main tuner is a Snark SN 8, but this one is just as accurate"}
{"source": " The only negatives I can find is that the hinge seems kinda delicate, so you don't want to force it, and the power button is very tiny, but for the size and performance of the unit, those low points are almost irrelevant"}
{"source": " Buy a couple, you can get two or three of these for the price of a single Snark or Korg"}

{"source": "  I've used both of these similarly priced tuners and have found them both to be excellent"}
{"source": "  I can't really tell any difference in the accuracy of either one"}
{"source": "  They are both contact tuners, meaning that they pick up the vibration of the instrument rather than relying on an external microphone"}
{"source": "The Hola! is definitely the best choice of the two in that it's more versatile, easier to use, more durable looking, and easier to store"}
{"source": "  The Hola! lies virtually flat and takes up less space in every dimension than the snark"}
{"source": "  It comes in a plastic sales container that can be reused to offer further protection if you feel the need"}
{"source": "  The Snark's curved display arm (which you can't really see in the photo) is slightly more delicate looking, in addition to the fact that it extrudes farther"}
{"source": "  I found the Hola! display to be bigger, brighter and generally easier to read"}
{"source": "  Honestly, most of these differences are minor especially when considering how inexpensive these tuners are"}
{"source": "  The really important difference is the &#34;tuning mode&#34; feature on the Hola!"}
{"source": "Hola! offers very simple operation with one button for power and for switching between its 4 modes of function"}
{"source": "  You can select &#34;chromatic&#34;, &#34;guitar&#34;, &#34;bass&#34; and &#34;ukulele&#34; modes by briefly pressing the power button (as opposed to a long-press for power on/off)"}
{"source": "  This is an especially important feature if the user is not an experienced and knowledgeable musician"}
{"source": "  Imagine trying to tune with a an 88-key piano if you don't know anything about the notes on the piano"}
{"source": "  &#34;Ukulele&#34; mode is like using a piano with only 4 notes"}
{"source": "  Use &#34;chromatic&#34; to tune your uke differently than standard or tune other instruments"}
{"source": "The snark *is* superior in it's rotating display which can be turned and rotated in almost any direction"}
{"source": "  If turning your head *at all* is a deal-breaker, get the Snark"}
{"source": "  I found the Hola!'s display to be more than sufficient"}
{"source": "  I'm currently using the snark on my guitar"}
{"source": "I've ordered 9 of these, and only one has been defective"}
{"source": " Not worth shipping it back, no big deal"}
{"source": " Great tuner for my guitar class! The Snark may have a few more features, but if all you need this to do is help you tune, you're good to go"}

{"source": "1) Adaptive tone"}
{"source": " The MM continuously listens to your voice and adjusts the compression, gate, EQ, and de-essing"}
{"source": " Even when recording dry vocals, at a minimum, you should at least set your compression, then in post production, add parametric EQ to place your vocals where they need to be set"}
{"source": "Now? I hit the tone button, and all that is done for me"}
{"source": " It makes a dynamic mic sound great! It makes working with a condenser mic easier"}
{"source": "2) Reverb"}
{"source": " Most home recording enthusiasts have problems applying reverb"}
{"source": " They either use too much or too little"}
{"source": " With this, when you it equally between wet and dry, you get the right amount of reverb to bring recording to life"}
{"source": " I recorded a vocal with club, room, and hall reverb"}
{"source": " Each one sat just right! When you solo the vocals, you can tell which is used"}
{"source": " In the mix it was more subtle"}
{"source": " Good Job!3) Pitch correction"}
{"source": " I have to admit, my own vocals aren't perfect"}
{"source": " When you record your own vocals, and you're like me, you'll hear a \"chorus\" sound in your headphones"}
{"source": " That's because you're hearing you own vocals and the pitch correction through the headphones"}
{"source": " This takes a second to get use to"}
{"source": "When set in the center, you can still do your vocal gymnastics, slide into notes, and it seems"}
{"source": " natural"}
{"source": " It pulls you to the closest not in the chromatic scale, so if you're way off, it will make your vocals sound out"}

{"source": " It can run off the Sanyo Pedal Power without issue however and I often use it on my acoustic pedalboard with a compressor and delay/reverb for my guitar"}
{"source": "When I originally went out to place this order, I was planning to order the  TC Electronics Singles VoiceTone C1 Vocal Effects Processor for its pitch correction function"}
{"source": " As I looked over that device and some alternatives, I finally ordered the TC-Helicon Mic Mechanic because it had pitch correction and some other very nice effects"}
{"source": " I ignored the reviewers who said the pitch correction function had no effect - how could TC Electronics put out the &#34;Mic Mechanic&#34; with a pitch correction function that didn't do anything? Well, those reviewers were right - the pitch correction function has NO EFFECT! Also, I couldn't see any effect between engaging/disengaging the tone button"}
{"source": " I kept the Mic Mechanic because I like the other effects, but I'm very disappointed in the primary reason I bought it!"}
{"source": "I purchased this to add basic effects to a small PA based on daisy-chainedPowerwerks PW50 Portable PA Systemheads and got a lot more than I bargained for"}
{"source": "The effects are beautifully done"}
{"source": " Reverb sounds natural and there is a wide range of choices for both reverb and echo"}
{"source": " For the record I keep mine set at Club with the wet/dry knob set to a straight 12 o'clock position"}
{"source": " Wet means more of the effect and dry means less"}
{"source": "There is a mic gain on the left side of the unit, and the mic input (XLR only) has phantom power"}
{"source": " The XLR out goes straight to your mixer"}
{"source": " There is also a USB port for software I do not use so I cannot speak to that feature"}
{"source": "The unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature, which I leave on"}
{"source": " It adds a dimension to vocals that does not interfere with them, not does it alter them in ways that are mechanical sounding - you can set it for minor to major pitch correction"}
{"source": " I suspect that most folks will want less of this than more"}
{"source": "Overall this is a perfect addition to a vocalist's toolbox because it is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive"}
{"source": " It's also perfect for adding vocal effects to small, bare-bones PA systems"}
{"source": " It transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true PA"}
{"source": "I have owned almost every octave/harmonizer/pitch shifter on the market"}
{"source": " For what this tiny 80 dollar box is capable of, you cant beat it"}
{"source": " First off, Its polyphonic"}
{"source": " You wont find that in anything else under $300"}
{"source": " Instant tracking, wide range of versatility, perfect volume balancing and very solid design"}
{"source": " Only two flaws: a very slight hum when compared to buffered bypass pedals, still doesnt hum as bad as my POG did"}
{"source": " The only flaw that irks me is that the affected note comes slightly flat when using just the pitch shift mode"}
{"source": " Its very minute but a well trained ear in a solo session will hear it plain as day"}
{"source": " Otherwise this inexpensive powerhouse is a grand slam"}
{"source": " Great job Mooer, i cant wait to try more of your stuff"}
{"source": "If you only want to use this thing as a detune effect to add a static, non-oscillating, chorus like effect, it's fine for that"}
{"source": "  As an actual pitch shifter though, this thing is awful"}
{"source": "  All the pitch shift settings sound like they're 30 cents sharp"}
{"source": " This is especially awful sounding when used as an Octave effect"}
{"source": "  I suppose I could have opened it up to see if there was an adjustment pot inside but I did not want to void the warranty so I just returned it"}
{"source": "  It's hard to believe that nobody at the company could hear how badly out of tune this pedal is"}
{"source": "  I've read the same complaint about their Pure Octave pedal also"}
{"source": " This is really too bad because all the other pedals for Mooer seem to be quite good"}
{"source": "  I own their Reecho Delay pedal and quite like it and I'm also tempted to get their Green Mile pedal"}
{"source": "If you're not that sensitive to pitch inaccuracies, this pedal maybe fine for you but I doubt that many will find this pedal to be satisfactory"}
{"source": "One minor quibble about the rubber padding used at the bottom of these pedals"}
{"source": "  It does not stick to the adhesive on ANY of the Velcro strips I've tried to use"}
{"source": "The Mooer Pitch Box in the harmonist mode blends the dry signal with the altered pitch, and in the pitch shift mode if filters out the dry signal"}
{"source": "The pitch knob allows you to raise the note 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 24 semitones, or lower the note by 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 24 semitones"}
{"source": "I found that putting a distortion pedal in front of the Pitch Box made the harmonies more pronounced"}
{"source": " Making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable"}
{"source": " And in general it helps it sounds more like a guitar and less like an organ"}
{"source": "When I had the pitch box in front of the distortion pedal, it had this constant warble that sounded like an out of tune guitar"}
{"source": " The detune mode sounds like a chorus but I almost never use it"}
{"source": "I started to play the violin a few months ago"}
{"source": "  When I got my violin, I purchased the Korg CA1 Chromatic Tuner thinking I would not need a metronome"}
{"source": "  The Korg CA1 also cost slight less"}
{"source": "  However, now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome"}
{"source": "  She has the Korg TM40 metronome"}
{"source": "  I opted to purchase the newer model Korg TM50PW Instrument Tuner and Metronome"}
{"source": "  It is great"}
{"source": "  Based on my experience, unless you are sure you do not need a metronome, I would recommend everyone purchased the TM40 or TM50 (just in case) instead of the CA1"}
{"source": "So ive been playing using this thing for a couple of weeks now"}
{"source": " Ive ran different setups and seem to work well with my pedals one at a time except for one issue that I noticed consistently, so beware of this"}
{"source": "One channel (#8) does 9v with 500mA, sounds great right?I plug in my Even Tide Timefactor and works great by itself"}
{"source": " Once I added other pedals, there became a horrible hum"}
{"source": " Like noticable and just horrible"}
{"source": " Then I used my stock Timefactor power supply and plugged in my entire rig without drawing 500mA from output 8, and there was no hum"}
{"source": "This phenomena also occured when I plugged in my Holy Grail pedal (the classic one) that draws 500mA as well"}
{"source": "kind of annoying to have a power strip to power all my pedal, but im not complaining about it for a power supply that is a fraction of the price of a vodoo pp2+, to power most of my pedal quietler than a one spot"}
{"source": "This thing Rocks! Unlike other cheap Chinese-made ripoffs (ahem"}
{"source": " Behringer) These Joyo products are well made, inexpensive and worth every penny"}
{"source": "I've read its not really complete isolated, but it does the job"}
{"source": " I didn't realise how much noise my one spot was adding"}
{"source": " I A/B them both one after the other and it truly was quieter"}
{"source": " the only Problem I have is my TC Helicon takes 12 volts input but 300MA"}
{"source": " this pedal only supplies 100MA so the pedal didn't work in the 12 volt slit"}
{"source": " Luckily however it does work plugged into the 9volt 300MA spot so im using it there"}
{"source": " everything else in the other 9volt 100MA slots"}
{"source": "it's a lot quieter now"}
{"source": " I recommend trying it and saving some cash"}
{"source": "Ordered a set of these to put 2 on my Ibanez and 2 on my Squier, they fit perfectly"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": "Not much to say here - they're knobs"}
{"source": " They look good, are well made and fit perfectly on the CTS pots in my guitar"}
{"source": "I wanted to find a device that let me record easily when at a gig, or just in my office"}
{"source": " I did a LOT of research into devices that were USB only, even other ones that Focusrite sold"}
{"source": " The main reason I picked this one was its versatility in being both iPad and USB compatible"}
{"source": "The complaints about the iPad connector cable are valid - it's too stiff and short"}
{"source": " I feel like I might accidently break it off if I'm not too careful"}
{"source": " Why it uses a proprietary connector on the back of the unit, I'll never know"}
{"source": " To combat the included 30-pin cable I bought a$10 3ft 30-pin extension cable, which seems to do the job nicely"}
{"source": " The GarageBand software on the iPad is simple enough to use, and while it can only record one of the 2 input channels at a time, that's fine for what I expected"}
{"source": " To record from a live sound-board, I just use the XLR input, set the gain (with the awesome colored halo ring), and save the recording as a mono track"}
{"source": "Being small and solidly built, I've got no problem tossing this in the milk-crate with the rest of my cables and peddles"}
{"source": "In regards to how it records when plugging into a computer via USB (an iMac in this case), it's even better than I expected"}
{"source": " The GarageBand software on the Mac does have the ability to record both input channels at the time time"}
{"source": " The on-board monitor volume and headphone is fantastic"}
{"source": " I thought it only would play back what was being input at that moment, but it does more than that"}
{"source": " It's a real monitor (the GarageBand software recognizes it's the monitor output), and when you have a multi-track recording that you're working on, the software allows you to pass back other tracks from the computer while recording a new track"}
{"source": "For example, I recorded a track with just the guitar (track 1), I was using the 1/4\" input channel, and laid down that track"}
{"source": " Then I created a second guitar track and recorded a second guitar part (headphones plugged into iTrack Solo) and I was able to hear both the current track I was recording, and the first track"}
{"source": " Lastly, I plugged in a mic into the first input, and created a 3rd vocal only track"}
{"source": " When I was singing, I was able to hear both guitar parts with the headphones still plugged into the iTrack Solo as well as my vocals recording in real-time"}
{"source": " I wasn't expecting this level of capability, and was very impressed by the lack of any noticeable latency in both the backing tracks and the vocals I was recording with all 3 going at the same time"}
{"source": "The last thing I want to mention is the XLR pre-amp"}
{"source": " Focusrite has been making high-end professional recording equipment for a long time, and the thing they're most well-known for is the mic pre-amp"}
{"source": " I have to say, it is spectacular"}
{"source": " There is absolutely no noise (no hiss, or clicks) of any kind"}
{"source": " The gain staging nobs with the color halos make it so easy to setup, it's almost too easy"}
{"source": " The sound it captures is exactly what you expect, and you'll notice right away if you're using a low quality microphone"}
{"source": " It definitely stands up to their reputation"}
{"source": " Having 48v phantom power to use those top dollar condenser mics is also a really nice thing to have"}
{"source": " The demos on their website show how simple it is to use"}
{"source": " Once you start playing with it, you'll realize it is a really nice tool for a solo artist, or someone who wants high portability, but great sound quality"}
{"source": "I got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue:  when I record a track either with the \"Audio Recorder\" or \"Guitar Amp\" screens in Garageband on my iPad 3, iOS7, the recording is great"}
{"source": " But once I toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made, there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable"}
{"source": "  Here's the other part of this: I can use Apogee Jam guitar interface, and iRig Pre microphone interface and Garageband behaves as it should and I can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever"}
{"source": " The Focusrite support folks suggested I do a backup of my iPad contents and then do a software restore but I opted to return the unit instead, since the Apogee and iRig both work perfectly with Garageband"}
{"source": " So, I don't know if the unit is having a problem with iOS7 or I just happened to get a lemon but I'll find out when the new one comes next week"}
{"source": "  If it works correctly, I'll update this review after doing a few recordings"}
{"source": " But, I would say if you've just updated to iOS7 or are thinking about it and you want to get this unit, you might want to hold off on that upgrade"}
{"source": "  UPDATE: Got a replacement unit and even did a restore on my iPad, as suggested by a Focusrite support tech, and STILL have the problem I discussed above"}
{"source": "  So, this product simply has turned out to be a dud for me"}
{"source": " If anyone else has a similar issue with this and find a resolution,  please let me know"}
{"source": "What else can be said that isn't implied in the title of this review? Not a single second wasted in this performance and this bundle is perfect for those of us who don't want to purchase the items separately"}
{"source": " My only issue was how long this took to come out considering the show was 5 years ago"}
{"source": " That and the fact they didn't play more songs but who can blame them, their catalog is  almost endless (one of the few bands who matched quantity with quality)"}
{"source": "Get this"}
{"source": " It was awesome! Blu-Ray surround with the band was just amazing"}
{"source": " Great extras too"}
{"source": " They were so much tighter on this concert than back in &#34;How the West was Won&#34;"}
{"source": "I love the performances and sound production quality of Celebration Day! The band's on fire and Jason Bonham did a incredible job"}
{"source": " A must buy for the Zep fan I can highly recommend this"}
{"source": "To rehearse that long for this one show it's a shame they could not consider another world tour or at least a few more concerts"}
{"source": " With Jason doing so well it was possible I could easily imagine NY, SF, Rio, Paris, Rom, Tokyo etc"}
{"source": "First of all its huge"}
{"source": " no"}
{"source": ", like really huge"}
{"source": "But finally you get over that, but seriously, its huge"}
{"source": "The three presets are what sets this apart, but this could have been so very much better"}
{"source": " why?"}
{"source": "the midi clock sync implementation is flawed"}
{"source": "A"}
{"source": " The midi clock sync of delay operation is erratic and largely unreliable, particularly if you wish to change presets during a song or turn them on/off"}
{"source": "B"}
{"source": " To have a midi in, and not be able to midi sync/quantize the looper"}
{"source": " sigh"}
{"source": "like really?"}
{"source": " This means you cant play with a drum machine, sampler, sequencer or play with anyone that does!So, while this offers some functionality above the Flashback in that this unit gives three preset delays (only one of which can be used at a time) and can be used as a basic looper (along with the delay defined by the knobs), The downside is a very large footprint"}
{"source": "Therefore:BUY if you have the space and either need the three presets, or have neither a looper OR a delay"}
{"source": "CONSIDER PASSING if the looper or midi functionality is seriously driving your decision"}
{"source": " both are weak, after the fact, implementations"}
{"source": "This is far more pedal than I need but what a fun pedal to have"}
{"source": "  Just going through the presets was fun, but downloading and trying the stuff they have available online was even funner :)  The bad part about this pedal is that it is HUGE and will take up a lot of space on your board"}
{"source": "  You have to be committed to dealy"}
{"source": "  You'll have 3 different presets available at one time from the footswitches"}
{"source": "  I can't comment on the looper as I never used it"}
{"source": "You can set up 3 delays configurations, what is a interesting option to use on stage"}
{"source": " Tap function also helps a lot"}
{"source": " All type of delays are sounds beatiful"}
{"source": "No manual"}
{"source": "  You can print one off the internet but it should come with one given it's price"}
{"source": "  I purchase such so I could lay down a rhythem track then go into the solo while attempting to play live"}
{"source": "  Don't believe this is what it is mean't for"}
{"source": "  A simple delay looper will suffice"}
{"source": "  This can do a ton of cool stuff but did not suit my needs"}
{"source": "I've just replaced the original, plastic nut on my new Squier Strat guitar with this one"}
{"source": "I had to file it down slightly to fit the slot and set the string height that I wanted but this was simple to do using a single flat metal nail file"}
{"source": "I was shocked at how much 'brighter' the guitar sounded with only this single change!Even my wife who claims to have a tin ear, commented on how much clearer it now sounds"}
{"source": "Also, the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated"}
{"source": " My piece arrived in a week (thank you very much!)"}
{"source": "For the low price, I think this will improve the sound of your guitar (safely) more than any other upgrade"}
{"source": "I needed a new stand for my home studio so I thought I was cutting corners when I purchased this one"}
{"source": " As it turns out, this stand is practically indistinguishable from myBelmonte Orchestra Stand Deluxein construction and material quality"}
{"source": " That stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this review"}
{"source": "The stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians, and is stable enough to use outside"}
{"source": " The rest/tray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments"}
{"source": " In fact, I have attached anAleratec Universal Tablet Mountto hold an iPad with sufficient room left over for a 438 page copy of theThe New Real Book - Volume 1and it holds those rock steady"}
{"source": "Another feature that I like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles, which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands"}
{"source": " Or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stand's footprint are not problems"}
{"source": "Bottom line: this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price"}
{"source": " I am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever I need another stand this is the model I will purchase"}
{"source": "This is a great stand and highly adjustable"}
{"source": " Can be used seated or standing for a person over 6 feet tall"}
{"source": " There was a review I read with negative comments about the design, claiming that pulling on the panel to lift the stand would cause it to come off"}
{"source": " Nonsense"}
{"source": " There are clamps for every adjustment and the stand is rock-solid"}
{"source": " Because it's lightweight and portable, I could see it getting top heavy if you put a heavy book on the stand and jacked it up to maximum height"}
{"source": " But this is a GREAT stand"}
{"source": "solid good stand, it is decent quality and doesn't have any places that will break easily"}
{"source": "  can take anywhere you want"}
{"source": "I wasn't expecting much from this case; I bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that I had also order off Amazon that was of better quality then I had expected"}
{"source": " This case is sweet! I love the black and crome, it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth"}
{"source": " If you need a case don't even think twice about, this is a great one at a great price"}
{"source": "For the money, this is a great guitar case"}
{"source": "  I bought it for a Silvertone SD10, which costs about $120"}
{"source": "  The guitar fits it fine"}
{"source": "  I use it to store my guitar around the house or put it in the back of the car to transport it"}
{"source": "  I don't think I would take it on an airline"}
{"source": "  They destroy luggage, so I don't think it would fair well"}
{"source": "  The compartment inside is large enough for picks, strings, capo and a strap with room to spare"}
{"source": "  Mine opens and closes ok and the lock works"}
{"source": " It is well worth the $60 I paid for it"}
{"source": "Looked at a lot of cases most priced $90 or above"}
{"source": "  Settled on this one because of price, reviews, and measurements posted here in the reviews that assured my my guitar would fit"}
{"source": "  I have an Alvarez AD60 (dreadnaught style body) and it fits in this case nice and snug"}
{"source": "  Solid, well padded, sturdy latches, and everything lines up"}
{"source": "  Very happy with my purchase"}
{"source": "This is exactly what I was looking for the protect my investment"}
{"source": "  I tried purchasing a soft case that had the Seagull logo on it and was advertized and fitting my guitar, it didn't"}
{"source": "  It was way too short for my Seagull S-12 Coastline"}
{"source": "  This is a sturdy case that looks good too"}
{"source": "Bought these as an extra set just in case I made a mistake when I was trying to cut down my nut and bridge"}
{"source": " They are real bone and fit well on my Yamaha"}
{"source": " Did not end up using them but will one day"}
{"source": " Great product for the price"}
{"source": "After reading many review on my Yamaha 700 acoustic guitar I have owned and played for 4 months, I finally took the advice of other consumers"}
{"source": "  MANY people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone"}
{"source": "This guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was"}
{"source": "  I did put a light set of D'addario strings that made a world of difference"}
{"source": "I was due for another string change so upgraded with this set of bone nut and saddle"}
{"source": "WOW, it really did make a huge difference"}
{"source": "  This guitar is such a quality piece, especially for the money"}
{"source": "  But, with the string and bone upgrades I can't imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic"}
{"source": "  It changed the tone to that of a classical  guitar"}
{"source": "  I am so happy with my changes"}
{"source": "The high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep"}
{"source": "  The sustain is a drastic improvement, each note lasting nicely into the next"}
{"source": "  I am so pleased and excited with my guitar"}
{"source": "If you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle"}
{"source": "change them, it's a very quick fix"}
{"source": "  And find a nice set of strings"}
{"source": "The saddle, after some minor rounding at the edges, fit perfectly as a replacement for the one that came with my Takamine acoustic"}
{"source": " I haven't replaced the nut yet, but even so the improvement in tone and sustain is quite noticeable"}
{"source": " These are high quality parts, well worth the relatively small investment"}
{"source": "Edit: I have since replaced the nut too, and am pleased to report it is a near perfect fit, though it is a tiny bit shorter across than the old one"}
{"source": " But the difference is negligible, and the improvement in tone and action was well worth the small additional expenditure of time and effort"}
{"source": "[Now that the SN-13 is about the same price as an SN-8, I've changed the comment about the price differential"}
{"source": "]The SN-13 is another great Snark chromatic tuner with a Super Tight display"}
{"source": " However, the black SN-8 adds a tap tempo metronome and the ability to set the tuner a few semi-tones below standard for about the same price"}
{"source": "  (No matter for me since all I use is the tuner, anyway"}
{"source": ")  Still, the SN-13 is *white* and, for all I know, may do a better job at tuning an older iPad"}
{"source": "  :-)"}
{"source": "Cheap, Easy, Durable, these things are worth the small price"}
{"source": " I have one for each guitar and just leave them on!"}
{"source": "I'll be honest here - I bought this one primarily because of its looks"}
{"source": "  Not a lot of white clip-on tuners around"}
{"source": " I also own an SN-8 and in comparing the two, the SN-13 seems to be as tight, but it's only four stars because as another reviewer mentioned you can get the SN-8 (which has more features) for a few dollars less than what you're paying for the SN-13"}
{"source": "  Still, it's a typical Snark"}
{"source": "  It registers very quickly, it's easy to read, and you don't have to pluck the string very hard at all for it to pick up the vibration"}
{"source": " The stem on mine is a little looser than I would prefer but it still stays in position"}
{"source": "My only real gripe isn't unique to this model but to all Snarks"}
{"source": "  The curved stem combined with the round head means it won't sit very flat in a gig bag pocket and the stems aren't exactly robust, so I'm always concerned that one day I'm going to take it out of my bag and it will be in three pieces"}
{"source": "  Other than that, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive and pretty accurate tuner"}
{"source": "I have several of these tuners and this one is as great as all the others"}
{"source": " Easy and quick"}
{"source": " No reason to be out of tune with these tuners"}
{"source": " The white is great but no matter what color they are, they are a quality product"}
{"source": " Rock on"}
{"source": "If you're going to use this as an insert effect into any amp, the first thing you need to do is turn off the amp model"}
{"source": "Although I liked the presets in the MS50G, none of them worked in my rig"}
{"source": " The first thing that I did when I brought it home was to make a different single patch for each effect"}
{"source": " The big question is &#34;Why?&#34; especially since it's designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously"}
{"source": " The answer is"}
{"source": " I like my overdrive, distortion, and compressor, but I couldn't make up my mind on delays, choruses, flangers, fuzz"}
{"source": " and it's always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortions"}
{"source": "This is the 4th pedal on my board sitting behind a ModTone Lemon Squeeze Compressor, TC Electronics MOJOMOJO overdrive, and a Wampler Sovereign distortion"}
{"source": "I give it 5 stars because it accepts pedals well and it serves so many different needs"}
{"source": " Normally, I have it set as just a chorus pedal, but occasionally I use it as an additional overdrive or distortion"}
{"source": " It's great to be able to plug in whatever I need and know that the sound quality is going to be great!It takes a moment to level match each patch so the transition is smooth, and at some point I may take the few remaining slots and make them combinations, but as of yet, I really haven't had the need"}
{"source": " a great utility pedal and a must if you're just getting started on your pedal board and you're not sure of what pedal you want where"}
{"source": " This will help you figure things out"}
{"source": " and if you're not careful, it may find a permanent home!"}
{"source": "Im an true analog guy"}
{"source": " But when I grabbed this pedal I was blown away"}
{"source": " This little thing packs a lot of serious effects for its size"}
{"source": " A lot of which do not sound to digital"}
{"source": " I was amazed at the tones I could pull out of it"}
{"source": " For $99- it is a steal"}
{"source": " I would pay twice that for what this pedal does"}
{"source": " Easy to navigate and understand"}
{"source": " Small enough to fit on any pedalboard"}
{"source": " Easily hooks up to the computer to download custom patches"}
{"source": " If you're looking for a multi effects stomp box, look no farther than the Zoom MS-50G"}
{"source": " Well worth the $99"}
{"source": "00"}
{"source": " Can easily set it up for live situations"}
{"source": " Of course you're not gonna get all the effects at a drop of a dime"}
{"source": " But I set mine up for a few effects I use live"}
{"source": " Works flawless"}
{"source": " When in the studio, this is where the pedal shines"}
{"source": " Also it can't be beat for when you're just jamming alone at home"}
{"source": " If you're are gigging, of course this isn't going to be your go to pedal, but it does come in handy for some really nice effects"}
{"source": " The review before mine, well they should of known this pedal isn't the greatest for live venues"}
{"source": " That's why we have pedalboards with all our different effects we can call up with the drop of a foot"}
{"source": " I was on the fence about this pedal for a week or so"}
{"source": " Went to a local music store, heard and was sold"}
{"source": " No one can touch Amazon's price and service"}
{"source": " Get off the fence and buy this pedal"}
{"source": " I promise you won't be sorry \\m/CONS: No power supply or USB cable"}
{"source": " Besides that, the pedal is a bargain and sounds fantastic!"}
{"source": "it is more than I hoped for! Very nice protection for my Luna! it is a solid casr that for the price cant be beat!"}
{"source": "Once again received a good product for a good price and fast delivery"}
{"source": "have never had any problems with any case bought thru amazon"}
{"source": " All latch well and look good"}
{"source": " Do not fly my guitars anywhere but do carry them in my truck over the road and no damage even with falls along the way"}
{"source": "have five hard cases of various brands and all bought thru amazon wirh no complaints with any of them"}
{"source": " All fit and work as expected"}
{"source": "I couldn't be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on Amazon"}
{"source": " This was a newly listed item on Amazon when I bought it, (in fact this review will be the first), so I was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback, but I'm glad I decided on this item"}
{"source": "I wanted something with several storage compartments, so I could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly"}
{"source": " This bag has six separate compartments for storage - three main zipped compartments, each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items"}
{"source": " Perfect! I also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled, as well as a guitar strap that I don't currently require as I already have one, but it's nice to have a spare now"}
{"source": "The padding of the bag is quite thin, but firm, so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying"}
{"source": " The two built in \"back-pack\" straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage, and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes to"}
{"source": "If you are in the market for a guitar bag and don't want to spend a fortune, I would definitely recommend you consider this item"}
{"source": " It is perfect for my requirements, and may well be for yours too"}
{"source": "I'm a beginner, so I'm not very picky on the accessories yet"}
{"source": " But this was a great package deal for this price"}
{"source": " Shipping was free, it arrived in under 1 week from ordering"}
{"source": "Pros:padded caselove the \"backpack\" featurehas many pocketsfits my Takamine Jasmine acoustic perfectpicks vary in size and shapestrap was easy to attachCons:strap is made from nylon and feels cheap (which it is, lol)some poor stitching in one area of the case (shoulder strap) exposing the padding, I restitched fairly easily"}
{"source": "I have had and tried about every compressor out there"}
{"source": "  Lastly the old standard Dyna Comp"}
{"source": " Only because its cheap but like the rest it sounds like a compressor and clips your tone"}
{"source": "  Blah"}
{"source": "  This is a very transparent compressor"}
{"source": "  I use it on acoustic guitar solo gigs and electric"}
{"source": "  Low setting on the switch and compressor set at about 11:00"}
{"source": "  It gives wonderful string balance and sustain"}
{"source": " At this setting you do not get any of the squashy clipping compression sounds"}
{"source": " And it does not wack the bottom out of your tone"}
{"source": "  None of the typical compressor hesitation when you pluck a string"}
{"source": "  Just balance and sustain"}
{"source": "  As close to a rack mount as it gets"}
{"source": " The blend knob solves all of the typical compressor issues"}
{"source": "  From here you can get any type of compression you want or need"}
{"source": "  Mine has a white case"}
{"source": "It arrived, I plugged it in, already had a battery in it"}
{"source": " Both knobs at 12 o'clock, toggle in middle, didn't change the internal switches"}
{"source": " BAM!! Guitar sounds alive! No more weak notes, the thin strings sound big now and match the thicker strings in power"}
{"source": " No compressor \"pumping\" very minimal noise (compressors by nature are noisy) It just make the guitar sound better, even and stronger"}
{"source": " Compressors can be a beast to control and you do have to go on faith that they work with out squashing or clouding your sound"}
{"source": " This pedal has been optimized for guitar, you can tell it is high quality"}
{"source": " If you play crystal clear you HAVE to have this pedal"}
{"source": " Driven, full distortion it adds sustain"}
{"source": " Im Sold"}
{"source": " Now I may just have to get the SL drive also by xotic"}
{"source": " look it up on youtube"}
{"source": "I had my doubts about the effectiveness of the blend knob but it is very effective indeed!  This compressor gives just the right amount of softness to the attack"}
{"source": "  It never sounds &#34;thumpy&#34; or unnatural - but always musical"}
{"source": "  I really think that this is what a guitar compressor is supposed to sound like"}
{"source": "straight out of the box this product reeked cheap"}
{"source": " No directions inside or on the box"}
{"source": " I messed with it for about 5 minutes"}
{"source": " I would not trust it with a heavy or expensive mic"}
{"source": " I read the description but it did not say cheap"}
{"source": " Live and learn"}
{"source": "I already use the EXL111 as my go-to electric string and tried these as part of the Vine program"}
{"source": "  I have to say I really couldn't feel the difference"}
{"source": "  From what I can see the only real difference in this balanced set is that the D string gauge is "}
{"source": "25, whereas the same string in the EXL111 set is "}
{"source": "24"}
{"source": "  Since the string construction and plating is the same, I have to assume these will have the same longevity"}
{"source": " I guess as long as both are still available (EXL111 being phased out?) i will be selecting solely on price"}
{"source": "  Either way you can't go wrong as D'Addario makes a fine product at a reasonable price"}
{"source": "Strung these up on my LP Goldtop with P-90's"}
{"source": "D'Addario promises these strings to be \"comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations\" that result in \"greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings"}
{"source": "\"I dunno anything regarding the science behind this, but the main difference in gauge seems to be slightly thicker A and D strings compared to the regular set of D'Addario 10s they offer"}
{"source": "  Its not a huge huge difference, but the strings are fairly unique in their feel and performance"}
{"source": "For one thing, they're pretty stiff"}
{"source": "  They bend, but not easily"}
{"source": "  Maybe that's what they mean by \"Balanced tension"}
{"source": "\"  They're also a tad mellow for roundwound nickel coated 10s"}
{"source": "  Not flatwound mellow, by any means, but not quite as bright as your regular set of 10s"}
{"source": "  I do get a great rock tone out of them, mind you, but you may be taken aback at first by their slightly darker sound"}
{"source": "  Personally, I like the tone I get out of them, they're big and warm without being dull sounding, but again, your preferences might differ"}
{"source": "One thing that's GREAT about these strings is, once they're properly stretched, they stay in tune FOREVER!  Again, maybe this is part of the \"balanced tension,\" and if so, good job D'Addario"}
{"source": "I haven't had them on forever to really see how long they last, but they've been on for two weeks and sound just as good as day one"}
{"source": "Who would these appeal to?  Well, if you like really light strings that bend easily, you're not going to like these"}
{"source": "  If you're a rythm player who does long gigs, the tuning stability and big warm sound mean these are for you!"}
{"source": "D'Addario strings are like the Kias of the string world"}
{"source": " They make cheap products that cost a lot less but last a lot less time"}
{"source": " These strings are OK"}
{"source": "I've always been partial to Nickel wound (particularly semi-flatwound, but I digress)"}
{"source": " My typical strings are Elixirs, so I'm used to them lasting a long time"}
{"source": " In this case, the strings sound good"}
{"source": "like most nickel strings do"}
{"source": " But they didn't last long at all before they started sounding dull and lifeless, and stopped keeping intonation accurately"}
{"source": " So, like most D'Addario strings"}
{"source": " So"}
{"source": "they're not bad, but don't expect them to last like Elixirs do"}
{"source": " You get what you pay for"}
{"source": "This is the most awesome loop pedal ever!!! does the trick perfect, you can remove and add in elements to your loop! super small, only potential drawback is that it cannot be battery powered"}
{"source": "This looper distinguishes itself by really only doing one thing but doing it really really well at a very affordable price"}
{"source": "  To record you simply press the button and the led will turn red, continue playing"}
{"source": "  When done simply tap again and the LED goes to green and plays back"}
{"source": "  At any time in the looping process if you want to overdub simply tap the button and record and tap to finish"}
{"source": "  No need to line it up with the loop, it places your overdub exactly where you played it in the loop"}
{"source": "  If you don't like the take a simple press and hold will erase the overdub"}
{"source": " Want to stop and clear (two presses and press and hold) and your back to a clean slate"}
{"source": "  I don't know the limit of overdubs but I haven't reached it"}
{"source": "  The amount of time for the looping I believe is 5 min so you can record an entire song and overdub to your hearts content"}
{"source": "  The tone preservation is excellent and haven't noticed any issues there"}
{"source": "  You can get a nice variety if you put this at the end of your effects change so that you can record a rhythm that is dirty and crunchy and overdub and record, then turn off your distortion and overdub a very nice clean lead over it"}
{"source": "  If I have something I like, I then output it to Sonar to play with some more"}
{"source": "Pros- Small, very easy to use (1 level knob and a stomp button), designed by guitarists and it shows, true bypass and plenty of room for recording"}
{"source": "Cons- You may consider lack of battery a con, I don't, everything goes on the effects rack and is powered through AC"}
{"source": "  No drum track or click track but then again, the aim for this device was to keep is simple, I believe"}
{"source": "UPDATE: I was having an issue with the looper one night being able to record but not hear myself"}
{"source": "  I contacted support and their response was quick but they basically said it sounds like it is broken, replace at the store which I did"}
{"source": "  It worked great then one night again, I couldn't hear myself recording"}
{"source": "  I played for about an hour with different configurations, it seems not all 9V AC adapters are equal"}
{"source": "  Out of the 4 I have it only liked 2"}
{"source": "  When I used that adapter it seemed to work just fine"}
{"source": "  So beware if you are having an issue you might want to look at the 9V AC Adapter"}
{"source": "Small footprint, simple to use, one button, one knob and does not suck tone out of my guitar"}
{"source": " It's only got a basic feature set but that's all I need"}
{"source": " Reasonable price too"}
{"source": " Highly recommended"}
{"source": "WOW! If you want 5 minutes of no-nonsense, clean looping and overdubbing,"}
{"source": "the tc electronics DITTO pedal will not disappoint! I have been exploring the fringes and outer limits of guitar FX for over 30 years and this one has, in just two days, become one of my Top Five 'Gotta Have' effects"}
{"source": " It is so simple that a five year old could make great loops, and it add ZERO addition sound to your signal"}
{"source": " Placed at the end of your pedalboard, which is easy to do because of the DITTO's tiny footprint, the possibilities for live stunts and grooves is mind-blowing"}
{"source": " And you can't beat the price"}
{"source": " I've uploaded a 5m workout that I recorded on my 2nd day using the DITTO if you'd like to hear it - a solo improvisation for Telecaster and reverb"}
{"source": " ["}
{"source": "]"}
{"source": "Perfect looper that is small enough to fit on anyone's pedal board"}
{"source": "  Many complain about not being able to use it during a live performance because of the single foot switch and they are right"}
{"source": "  Having to do everything with a single footswitch is a bit distracting"}
{"source": "  The ditto is great for practice, though"}
{"source": "Amazon and TC Electronics will not tell you that you need a 9V Power Supply"}
{"source": " I didn't see any warning or advise in the Point of Purchase, nor in the package"}
{"source": " This is an unfair practice from Amazon and TC Electronics"}
{"source": "Let me start by saying that this is a really cool pedal, and TONS of fun"}
{"source": " I can see how this could make you a better player and i think it could also be used live"}
{"source": "BUT (and this is a big but) this is my first \"one star\" review ever"}
{"source": "My first \"less-than-5-star-review\" ever"}
{"source": "same as others, switch failed less than ten days of owning it"}
{"source": " used less than ten times total, light use at home, I wasn't even wearing shoes! By the way, a gigging/recording musician for over 25 years so i am not a youngster that misuses my stuff"}
{"source": " Bummer too GREAT idea"}
{"source": "poorly executed"}
{"source": "I will not buy anther one"}
{"source": " I will not recommend to other musicians"}
{"source": "I'm a raw and green beginner who is about the slowest learner ever"}
{"source": "am 43 almost 44 and have been learning since 42 almost 43"}
{"source": " That being said using the looper was an eye opener"}
{"source": " I bought it as a learning aide , to loop a progression and then try and run some pentatonics over the progression"}
{"source": " The thing that opened my eyes is listening to the looped progression I played"}
{"source": " There's no denying your mistakes when you hear them while not playing"}
{"source": " Let's just say I'm not as close to being a player as I thought and I would &#34;not&#34; figured this out for quite some time if not for the looper"}
{"source": " So it is an amazing critic for us beginners "}
{"source": " And if your like me ( and you experienced guitarist ) you saw all the demos online and know what you as an experienced player can use it for"}
{"source": " It's an incredibly easy to use piece of equipment , after playing around with it for about 5or 10 mins you'll have the gist of it"}
{"source": " From what I understand it's very basic compared to other loopers , i dont know anything about that but if your looking for just a simple to use looper this will definitely be to your satisfaction"}
{"source": "Tascam is an industry leader in pro audio and have been for many years"}
{"source": " Their quality is unmatched dollar for dollar and these are no exception"}
{"source": " Excellent sound quality, premium fit and comfort for wearing all day as we do at the station"}
{"source": " You can't go wrong with these, we're ordering 8 more pairs!"}
{"source": "I've tried these out in head-to-head (excuse the pun) runs versus Steelseries, Plantronics, Panasonic, and Sony headphones that all cost more"}
{"source": " and the Tascam TH02 keeps up!I'm really surprised at how well they perform"}
{"source": "  Lows are good, mids are clean, and highs are crisp"}
{"source": "  Yes, the lows could be a bit beefier, but out of the headphones I compared it to, only the Plantronics excelled in that area"}
{"source": "For fit: I have a large noggin; like, size 7 5/8 hat"}
{"source": "  And these headphones fit well!  Not too tight, snug, but not confining"}
{"source": " The padding is good and soft"}
{"source": "Seriously, I'd rather buy three of these and burn through them if they break (which they haven't, and I've taken them everywhere) than spend $100 on another set"}
{"source": "These headphones are 100% amazing"}
{"source": " I could not believe the sound quality"}
{"source": " I have been an audio engineer for over 30 years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth $200-$300"}
{"source": "nice wide spectrum and frequency response, you will love them, well worth the price"}
{"source": " (no I do not work for Tascam)"}
{"source": " the first pair I bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easily"}
{"source": "so I ordered another pair, because the sound is amazing, I just need to be more careful next time!!"}
{"source": "but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction"}
{"source": "I have yanked my Senhieser's millions of times and the cord never broke, so be careful with the cord on this headphone"}
{"source": "it is not the best, but the sound is superior"}
{"source": "VERY VERY loud electric guitar amp! As a bass player, I was shocked that 40W could be that loud for guitar"}
{"source": " I can't raise the volume above 1 in my house"}
{"source": " When you switch it to acoustic or bass mode, the volume decreases dramatically, but it is a great amp for guitar players who also play bass occasionally"}
{"source": "Excellent top quality features"}
{"source": " Beautiful sound for each of the different modes"}
{"source": " The acoustic setting really made my cheap electric guitar SOUND like it was an actual acoustic"}
{"source": " The amp simulation is top notch"}
{"source": "Awesome value for the price!Edit: I've played through it more as a bass amp and after turning some dials and trying out the different settings"}
{"source": "I'm even MORE impressed"}
{"source": " One of the reasons the volume for bass was so much lower was that the default gain is at zero"}
{"source": " I brought the pre and post gain up to a reasonable level and BOOM"}
{"source": "huge sound"}
{"source": " I play with a 18 piece dance band and usually bring my Hartke kickback for that group"}
{"source": " After experimenting more, I would not hesitate to use the Peavey for rehearsals and performances with that band"}
{"source": "I still can't get over the fact that it is a 40W amp"}
{"source": " The sound is enormous and clean for that much wattage"}
{"source": "I have already laid down 8 tracks and the process is effortless"}
{"source": " Easy export to Protools for final mix but the internal tools are sufficient for a decent working demo"}
{"source": "The DP-008EX Pocketstudio is the next generation design of the DP-03 Digital Portastudio"}
{"source": " I have access to both units and hope to compare them as well as describe the DP-008EX on its own terms, pointing out features and issues important to me (mostly workflow-related) as someone who grew up home-recording with analog equipment"}
{"source": "(If you want all the details of the full functionality I'd recommend downloading the manual from TASCAM or a dealer site that offers it"}
{"source": ")Speaking of the manual I found it to be essential, at least at first"}
{"source": " There are so many features that it will likely take some time to explore and incorporate them so having a copy handy (or better yet downloading a second copy) is a good idea"}
{"source": "This is picky but I found the larger size of the DP-03 manual easier to read and handle than the smaller DP-008EX"}
{"source": "I've used software-based DAWs for years and, while I enjoy MIDI recording, mixing, and editing with them, basic audio tracking never felt as comfortable or spontaneous as when I used analog equipment"}
{"source": " I have a one-room home studio with minimal acoustic treatment and, aside from PC noise, I miss the simplicity and tactile response of my old MK-II cassette 4-track:  Instant power on, press record/pause, ready-set-go"}
{"source": "  Granted, I don't miss the `wall of hiss' that plagued those recordings but I had fun capturing a lot of musical moments"}
{"source": "Using a hardware control surface with my DAW didn't solve the problem - I just find the reality of booting Windows, dealing with the inevitable patching and other software distractions to be too toxic to the creative moment - especially when recording acoustic instruments"}
{"source": "I hoped the DP-008EX would provide some of that older experience - with digital audio quality in a size that would integrate easily with my existing setup"}
{"source": "The bottom line for me is: It does and it doesn't"}
{"source": "First some comparison points that may not be obvious from the product images in the descriptions:Size-wise, the difference between Porta and Pocket studios is roughly 11 1/2 x 2 x 8 inches versus 8 3/4 x 1 3/4 x 5 inches"}
{"source": " TASCAM doesn't provide a case or cover for the DP-008EX but a larger eReader or tablet case should do fine and I'd recommend one if you plan on portable use - the plastic appears fairly durable but it's still plastic"}
{"source": "The knobs on the DP-008EX are smaller in diameter, lower, and have rounded tops compared to those on the DP-03"}
{"source": " However, I find their slightly `rubbery' matte finish just as easy to grip"}
{"source": " I also find the smaller, circular pushbuttons on the DP-008EX don't protrude above the surface as much as the larger bar-shaped buttons on the DP-003 and are less comfortable to use"}
{"source": "The data wheel is identical in size and has a bit less resistance on the DP-008EX which I prefer - the wheel gets a workout and you want responsiveness when selecting from menus"}
{"source": "You'll need the dedicated PS-P520 5v power supply for the DP-008EX; the 12v PS-1225L for the DP-03 can't be shared"}
{"source": " (The plug won't fit so you can't fry it - and don't even think of using batteries when recording anything you take seriously)"}
{"source": "  On the other hand, the Teac RC-3F footswitch is sharable - you'll need a mini plug to phone adaptor - but I think it's indispensable if you're working alone"}
{"source": "Speaking of power, a strong plus for both recorders (and for me a deal-breaker were it not present) is phantom mic power so you're not limited to the built-in stereo condensers"}
{"source": " They're not bad for rough work but, unlike mic stand-mounted portables, it would be a challenge to position this unit close to some instruments and vocals"}
{"source": " I can get a decent acoustic piano recording in a good-sounding room but for close mic recording of guitar (acoustic or electric amp), violin, or percussion I want the flexibility of a mic stand and better quality mics"}
{"source": "I like the resistance of the faders on the DP-03, but I can understand how the lack of real estate kept them off the DP-008EX"}
{"source": " There's no CD burner either on the smaller unit but with USB 2"}
{"source": "0 transfer capability, that's not an issue for me"}
{"source": "Having similar XLR, phono and RCA jacks along the back edge of both units is an acquired taste"}
{"source": " I'm not  bothered by it because I have space to run the cables but it's worth considering your physical layout and whether that works for you"}
{"source": "The LED screen appears to be identical in size on both units and that leads me to my main workflow issues:The flat positioning of the screen makes using the unit on a flat surface less comfortable than it should be - especially since the menu is used so much"}
{"source": " A slanted or adjustable screen mount would probably be asking for design trouble:  I do woodworking and made myself a simple stand that slants at 25 degrees and doesn't interfere with jack access - it makes a tremendous difference on my neck and upper back while reading the screen and for general use"}
{"source": " TASCAM should consider a similar accessory"}
{"source": "The software is largely the same for both units, aside from additional mastering `tools' (essentially packaged presets), and here lies my major criticism: I feel a real conflict between directly accessing functionality (i"}
{"source": "e"}
{"source": " levels, EQ, arming tracks) with dedicated knobs and buttons, and being forced to indirectly access other functionality using what I see is an inflexible, constraining menu  system"}
{"source": "If there were some way to customize the menu navigation (the equivalent of software hot-keys) it's possible the frequent repetition of non-functional steps such as pressing the home button and selecting with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they do"}
{"source": "The best evidence of an unbalanced design I see is the dedicated Phantom power button on both units whose purpose is - to display the \"Phantom\" screen where you then make a selection to turn the power on and off! That crystallizes for me the hybrid character and compromises made here between software-based recording and using a dedicated hardware recorder"}
{"source": "When space for knobs and buttons is severely limited I can understand the design thinking and trade-offs that drive having so much functionality accessible through the menu"}
{"source": " But the DP-008EX is stuffed with knobs and buttons and even my first multi-tracker, a Fostex X-15, effectively doubled-up the functionality of two tracks to cover four"}
{"source": "  So I have to question whether the trade-offs TASCAM made here in fact diminish the user experience"}
{"source": "With connectivity and software-based recording using even smaller devices rapidly improving, I believe the market for dedicated hardware recorders such as the DP-008EX will be largely made up of people like me who grew up with older recorders and are looking to recapture some of that experience"}
{"source": " I think TASCAM would be well-served taking that into account"}
{"source": "I've always liked the design of TASCAM gear; it just looks and feels well-made, and that's still in large part true of the DP-008EX"}
{"source": " But I can't help believing that a simple digital equivalent of my old MK-II cassette 4-track would satisfy a lot of people out there (and not to mention make a terrific hack for someone with the electronics chops to pull it off!)"}
{"source": "As with any new device or toy we buy we discover the good and bad points"}
{"source": "first the good"}
{"source": "THE GOOD: 8 tracks that can be recorded 2 at a time"}
{"source": "has RCA outs which is good for monitors and or headphone amp as well as a 1/8\" headphone out"}
{"source": "a durable feel, a nice design, XLR inputs with phantom power, lit screen to see better (Very Nice)"}
{"source": " wav 16bit 44khz recordings, auto punch in, comes with a 2gb card and can take up to 32GB SD cards"}
{"source": "has effects has a metronome, mastering internal track apart form the 8 tracks, built in guitar tuner, EQ, Compression in and out, nice dual stereo up front mics that are real good sounding and all 8 track mixing, bouncing to 2 of your tracks  even the tracks that are bounced to, the previous tracks 'that are there' that still are plying bounce too, very cool"}
{"source": "and much more"}
{"source": "THE BAD: short battery life, No AC adapter included, need to buy (Cheap off ebay around $8"}
{"source": "00)"}
{"source": "small buttons, bad sounding reverbs, auto punch in gives you 2 seconds after pushing buttons to record, COME ON TASCAM, 2 SECONDS!!!!!?????? I can't get back into recording part with a guitar in 2 lead in seconds all alone!!!!! No guitar effects or Drum patterns like Boss's BR Micro 4 and 80"}
{"source": "(boss has it's problems too, believe me)sometimes it just hangs up, (think there is an unlock or reset pen press thing on the side)HORRIBLE REVERBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!moreEven though this untit has its good and not so goods, it is a great device, you can import and export songs to this to and from your computers recording software, remember its 16 bit wavs only to and from DAW"}
{"source": "Tascam please lengthin the auto punch lead in from 2 seconds to 5 seconds or more on next firmware and dont make another new unit just to improve what a firmware can do!!!"}
{"source": "Jim"}
{"source": "Tascam had the first inexpensive multitrack recorder on the market, and even as competitors entered the market they've managed to stay on top"}
{"source": " I've owned or borrowed models from Fostex and Korg going back several decades but Tascam always seems to be out in front when it comes to ease of use and value"}
{"source": " Even as the market evolved from cassette to digital, Tascam recorders have kept the same feel and ease of use"}
{"source": " I had a Boss Micro BR-80 for a while, but I found the all-menu interface annoying and difficult to use"}
{"source": " I kept forgetting the sequences to set up rhythm tracks, record, and mix down, and ended up having to repeat things over and over"}
{"source": " I soon sold it, and then replaced it with a Tascam DP-004 when that appeared on the market"}
{"source": " The Tascam wasn't really any more powerful than the Boss, and lacked the built in rhythm tracks, but it had fewer menus and more actual switches and knobs that made it more intuitive in use, and more like an actual mixing board or traditional cassette-based recorder"}
{"source": "After the DP-004 Tascam produced a follow-on six track unit and this recorder, the 8-track DP-008"}
{"source": " When it was first introduced a couple of years ago it really was a revolutionary unit"}
{"source": " There were plenty of 8-track recorders out there, but none that were that small and that inexpensive"}
{"source": " It's also more than just a DP-008 with more tracks"}
{"source": " The DP-008 has a much improved mastering ability that allows you to adjust EQ, compression, and effects individually on tracks for the mix down, while leaving the original tracks unaffected"}
{"source": " Like the DP-004, it has built in microphones and can also be used for direct stereo recording"}
{"source": " Unlike the DP-004, it comes with an external power supply in the box (a $24 option with the original 004) and can use an external battery pack"}
{"source": "I've been playing with my 008 all weekend, doing a mixture of stereo and multitrack recordings"}
{"source": " One thing I noticed right off was that there's a significant amount of noise in the monitor mix while multitracking"}
{"source": " I was afraid this would translate into noisy recordings, but the noise isn't there in the finished playback"}
{"source": " I also noticed that while the basic recording functions are more or less unchanged from those on the 004, the new mixdown functions are much more complex and required constant reference to the manual"}
{"source": " As mentioned previously, there's an awful lot of capability there and it's going to take some time to be able to use it effectively"}
{"source": " Most of that functionality is menu-based, rather than being accessibly directly from the front panel, and I have to say that's one thing I don't really care for"}
{"source": " The only input device you have to select functions and parameters and menus is a scroll wheel that's not nearly as comfortable as a knob or a mouse or touchpad"}
{"source": "Most of my recording lately has been done with various Apple platforms"}
{"source": " At home, I use Garage Band on my iMac and a USB-equipped Alesis console for input"}
{"source": " Away from home I use Garage Band on my iPad and (for ultimate portability) iPod Touch"}
{"source": " All of these platforms are much more intuitive to use than the DP-008 and much more powerful"}
{"source": " Of course, they're also a lot more expensive, and lack the built-in stereo microphones and ability to plug instruments and microphones directly in without some sort of additional interface"}
{"source": " Having XLR connectors as well as 1/4\" inputs is a really nice touch, something you never saw on portables from a few years ago"}
{"source": " I like the old-school approach of the DP-008 as well as the all-in-one package approach"}
{"source": "If I was just starting out in home multitrack recording and didn't have a lot to spend, I think the DP-008 might be a good choice"}
{"source": " It's really good enough to produce music for a band's first CD releases, and costs less than a decent microphone"}
{"source": " WIth 8 full tracks there's no need to do track bouncing to get four instruments and four voices down, and if you really need to, you can bounce and add a further six tracks, giving you 14 in all"}
{"source": " I don't think it's going to replace my iPod for pocket portability or my iPad for functionality (Garage Band gives me a full orchestra, keyboards and drums as well) but having the microphones and instrument preamps built in does make it much easier to set up and use for live recording"}
{"source": " It should get a lot of use at my home and elsewhere in the coming year"}
{"source": "Everything keeps improving, and getting better, faster, and cheaper, but at this price point their isn't one available that isn't a compromise in one way or another"}
{"source": " First off if you are planning on buying the US-322 don't"}
{"source": " Buy its bigger brother the US-366"}
{"source": " Getting an optical connection and additional ins and outs for such a little bit more money, as well as 192k makes it a no-brainer"}
{"source": " To get optical (on the 366 only) at this price is great, but the A/D D/A converters leave a bit to be desired"}
{"source": " On the other hand the mic pres are pretty good, have distortion ratings, THD of only 0"}
{"source": "0045% and with 24 Bit/192KHz recording make these the best sounding interfaces put out by Tascam to date"}
{"source": "What I meant by a compromise is that even with interfaces that cost 3 to 5 times this price most of them have either good mic pres, and weak clocks, or vice versa, and some work with Windows but not so well with MAC and once again vice versa, etc"}
{"source": " I researched interfaces for a long, long time, and considering non-crash reliability and a dozen other factors I finally sprung for anRME Fireface UFX USB 2"}
{"source": "0 or Firewire High Performance audio interface 30 in, 30 out"}
{"source": " Now that's an interface"}
{"source": " I have been running it with Pro Tools 9 since 2011"}
{"source": "Pro Tools 10- Professional audio recording and music creation softwareis out and Pro Tools 11 is now being released"}
{"source": "So if you are looking for an inexpensive interface expect some compromises in one area or another"}
{"source": " Rather than slam it out with performance specs under a microscope, I would rather provide a review helping those who are interested in setting up this Tascam US-322 or 366 so you can save a lot of time trying to figure it out"}
{"source": " Sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved"}
{"source": " So what I did was load, and register the free and included Cubase LE6 complete with activation and eLicense registration and installation as well as installing the Tascam driver, and doing updates for both"}
{"source": " I know a lot of the reviews here just downloaded a driver and used their existing DAW in order to test out the interface, and therefore they didn't need to spend much time with it"}
{"source": " I don't blame them; the shortest distance between two points is a straight line"}
{"source": " So get out a cup of coffee because installing this complete package doesn't happen in just one hour"}
{"source": " So here goes"}
{"source": "If you have Windows Vista you are probably out of luck because the system requirements list Windows XP, 7, and 8"}
{"source": " I am sure the omission of Vista is not a mistake"}
{"source": " I know myLogitech AudioHub Notebook Speakersare non-functional in my Vista laptop if you are running Windows Media Center in it as well"}
{"source": " It works in Win 7 just fine"}
{"source": " So I installed it in my desktop running Windows 7 64 bit and it gives you the option of installing in 32 or 64"}
{"source": " In addition to Cubase LE 6 it also installed AI Elements 6 as well as Agent One Content, Groove Agent One, Vintage Beat Boxes, Steinberg Drum Loop Expansion 01 which took a good amount of time to load, as well as Steinberg Halion Sonic SE 64 bit for AI Elements"}
{"source": " I then had to activate and register Cubase LE6 which involves installing the latest eLcc, creating a Steinberg account (which is free and they don't ask you for a credit card)"}
{"source": " They provide you with an activation code after you register"}
{"source": "I have an iLok for Pro Tools which is a USB device that enables you to run the program"}
{"source": " Cubase does not require that you have one, although they have an equivalent looking device, but fortunately they have a software based equivalent"}
{"source": " They do this with an eLicense which you will then update to version 6"}
{"source": "5"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": "1122"}
{"source": " There is an eLicense control setup and you have a Soft eLicenser number that you will use in order to generate the Activation Code generated at the Steinberg site"}
{"source": " What came on my disc was version 6"}
{"source": "05 which they instruct you to immediately do an update, which I did to version 6"}
{"source": "07"}
{"source": "So we install the Tascam interface next which comes on a separate DVD"}
{"source": " Included with the interface is a 5 foot USB printer style cable"}
{"source": " You will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer"}
{"source": " Windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver"}
{"source": " So install the driver off of the disc first, and then do the update"}
{"source": " It took at least 15 minutes to do that update"}
{"source": " What flashed on the screen was 154 megabytes and then all you see is an install screen with a scrolling series of round objects moving"}
{"source": " At first it says, \"This is going to take a long time\", and they were exactly right"}
{"source": " It almost tempts you to think something is wrong, because nothing is happening other than the scrolling, and then finally after ten minutes or so a dialogue box comes up and says, \"Do you want to install?\" and you click continue, and then it comes up again in another minute, and this happens a few times, and then finally it changes over to an installation finished box"}
{"source": " (I have Verizon FIOS and usually download huge amount of data in a flash)"}
{"source": " Then you reboot"}
{"source": "Now this is important"}
{"source": " Plug the US-322 directly into an available USB 2"}
{"source": "0 port and not into a hub, even if it is a powered hub"}
{"source": " It simply won't work"}
{"source": " I tried it and the light wouldn't even come on indicating USB"}
{"source": " When I went direct the interface lit up and it worked"}
{"source": " The manuals also warn you not to use it with USB 1"}
{"source": "1"}
{"source": " The US-322 comes with a printed Quick Start Guide"}
{"source": " There is also an owner's manual for both the Interface, and Cubase that are available either on the DVD, or by Googling the same and they come up as a PDF download"}
{"source": " If you are new to setting up interfaces be prepared to do a good deal of reading"}
{"source": " There is a driver to choose, input and output settings, as well as going into Windows Control Panel/Sound in order to choose the interface for playback, and recording"}
{"source": " If you're new to these kinds of setups just take your time, and don't be dismayed if something doesn't work"}
{"source": " All it takes is for one button to get pushed and Wahlah you have sound"}
{"source": " For example in Cubase there is a monitoring button without it you won't get any sound from the headphones"}
{"source": " If all else fails you can go to the Tascam web site by Googling Tascam US-322 and then click on the support tab, and they have a \"you pay for it\" phone call number in order to help you"}
{"source": " Hope this helps"}
{"source": "PS: The real killer deal right now is Avid Pro Tools 9 bundle with the MBox Mini which is another limited interface but you are getting Pro Tools 9"}
{"source": " Plus purchases of this bundle made after 10/2011 that has pro tools 9 will be able to have a free upgrade to pro tools 10 if you register your product with Avid"}
{"source": " Considering what Pro Tools goes for by itself, and what the MBox sells for individually, and the bundle even comes with the iLok you can sell it used for what you are paying for it, and even more than you are paying for it if you take advantage of the discounts I have seen pop up as much as 20% off the already low price"}
{"source": " Then you have Pro Tools 9, and 10 full blown versions, none of this LE stuff, and an interface, and can grow from there"}
{"source": " This Tascam interface works great with Pro Tools"}
{"source": " These Pro Tools 9 bundles are discounted to make way for 11, and I am seeing music stores running out of them"}
{"source": " They are clearing the shelves preparing for 11, but it has bugs"}
{"source": " I rarely purchase totally new versions until they have time to season some, and get feedback from users"}
{"source": " After some time, and more updates, I will be browsing the shelves for discounts on the upgrade to 11; maybe in another year"}
{"source": " PT 9 is all I need"}
{"source": "I love Tascam gear, and have used it for nearly 30 years"}
{"source": " I was excited to try out this interface and see what it could do"}
{"source": " Unfortunately, I was disappointed"}
{"source": "While the construction and mechanical function of the device itself were good, the actual function with the computer left much to be desired"}
{"source": " Also, the complete lack of a manual with the one I got made it very difficult understand the functions"}
{"source": " (Sorry, but with a device this expensive and which includes 2 CDs of software, how hard would it be to include a full manual on the install CD?)There was a very small quick start guide included, which basically just named the various switches, inputs, and outputs, and gave extremely sparse directions about using the software mixer screen"}
{"source": " I was forced into trial and error to see if I could get a serious recording in anything remotely resembling a multi-track mode"}
{"source": " I could not"}
{"source": " I could record and layer multiple tracks (I was using Audacity, didn't want to install Cubase), but I could not get playback from the previous tracks while I also had live input"}
{"source": " Now this could have been my computer or Audacity, as it is an older Win XP machine, but it played back multiple tracks without problem"}
{"source": "There was nothing in the mini-quickstart guide to address this, or even hint where one should look, other than going to Tascam's web site"}
{"source": " I'm sorry, but that is just not good enough with a device this expensive"}
{"source": " There should be a complete manual, at least in pdf, included with the product"}
{"source": " If I am going to use this to do serious recording, the last thing I want to do is waste huge amounts of time digging information out of a website, or worse, from \"user community\" threads in some blog"}
{"source": "Which brings me to another minor complaint - no Linux drivers included"}
{"source": " I use mostly Linux, with only one Windows machine for software which I can't get on Linux"}
{"source": " I wanted to try the software under Wine on Linux but was under time constraints"}
{"source": "Then there are the generic problems with software interfaces replacing hardware"}
{"source": " With a hardware mixer, I can access as many controls as my fingers can handle (3 or 4 on some mixers) at the same time"}
{"source": " Computerized mixers can only do 1 thing at a time, and one must be constantly moving the cursor from one thing to another to access controls"}
{"source": " The controls on  this interface were very fussy, and you have to position the cursor just exactly on a very small portion of a button to get it to react"}
{"source": " I found it very tedious, and again, no actual instructions were included to help with that process"}
{"source": " With a touch screen, it might be easier, but then why not just use buttons on a real mixer in that case? (Yeah, I know, touch screens are COOL"}
{"source": ")Also, software based functions are always limited by your computer and OS, and that means everyone can have a different experience - consistency is much harder to maintain"}
{"source": "I am old school, and find hardware mixers far more responsive and useful"}
{"source": " I know that lots of people are all excited about having software versions of hardware in their computers, and saving space, etc"}
{"source": ", etc"}
{"source": " I value function over fashion, however, and that is what I have always liked about Tascam gear: it was supremely functional"}
{"source": " This software falls far short of what I expect from Tascam, and the lack of a manual for the interface is inexcusable"}
{"source": "Good mixers, especially for multi-track recording, can be complex and difficult to learn"}
{"source": " The layers of signal interconnection can be hard to understand at first, and takes some time to get comfortable with"}
{"source": " Old Tascam manuals actually used to have a certain amount of instruction in multi-track recording, which was helpful to aspiring recording artists"}
{"source": " Not so here"}
{"source": "I had really hoped to give this 3 or 4 stars, but sadly, it only rates a 2 (2"}
{"source": "5 if I could) for me"}
{"source": " Come on, Tascam, you can do better than this"}
{"source": "Definitely the best combination of price, durability and sound quality that I've come across"}
{"source": " Plus, the tweed look really grows on you"}
{"source": "  Ordered a bunch for the studio, and a bunch more for home"}
{"source": " Holds up well, even after being yanked and crushed and stepped on"}
{"source": " Do it!"}
{"source": "The cable tangles easily"}
{"source": " Not stiff enough"}
{"source": "It get's in the way and is hard to stay stretched out"}
{"source": " But the color and the cloth cover is cool looking and has a more personal feel than the common rubber types"}
{"source": " It also seem tightly put together at the ends"}
{"source": "Yep"}
{"source": " it holds the strap on the neck of my guitar"}
{"source": " I have a Washburn rover, a backpacker style, and so a stap is a necessity, and this works just great"}
{"source": "Love my assortment of picks and the price was right"}
{"source": " I like that their is different gauges, because I don't always like using the same so this is great with the three different gauges to choose from in all these nice colours but I only received 47 instead of 48 picks but whose counting, i'm  still happy with my picks and would purchase from seller again, thanks"}
{"source": "If you are picky these are all eye candy"}
{"source": " nice flexible, easy to hold and I received on time at a great price"}
{"source": "You have just simply got to try this little guitar stand"}
{"source": "  It folds up so small, and yet remains very stable in use"}
{"source": "  Adjustable in a snap, but if you even forget that, it will grip your instrument better than a metal stand"}
{"source": "  Anything can be knocked over, but this really works better than you might believe"}
{"source": "  Goood !"}
{"source": "I love the Hola! small instrument stand"}
{"source": " It is sturdy and folds up nicely for me to take with me when I go to the Ukulele Club"}
{"source": " It has a nice rubber padding so I trust putting my instrument on it"}
{"source": " I have a Tenor Ukulele and it fits just fine on this stand"}
{"source": " It is very lightweight which is also a plus"}
{"source": " I use the stand at home too"}
{"source": " I stand my ukulele on it because sometimes I play and then I want to go to YouTube to listen to a particular song"}
{"source": " It is very convenient"}
{"source": "  I have recommended this stand to others also"}
{"source": "Features I like: lightweight, sturdy and folds up easily"}
{"source": "I've been able to purchase 5 of these in different sizes for all my pickin' pals"}
{"source": "  Lightweight, easy to transport in the back of your amp, or just put it in a bag with your music"}
{"source": "  THESE are good values for the money, and do not fall over easily"}
{"source": "  Those little grippers on the ends and the back actually work"}
{"source": "  I mean really work well too"}
{"source": "  Not so wonderful for uneven dirt or grass areas, but otherwise"}
{"source": "  They are the BOMB !  whee"}
{"source": "This is a modeling amp"}
{"source": "  IT has several presets, to emulate different sounds"}
{"source": "  They factory settings for these are pretty good, and all but the first bank (of three) can be adjusted and saved as new presets on the amp"}
{"source": "  If you get the fender fuse software (license comes with the amp) you can get some pretty amazing &#34;pre&#34; sets from fender and other users"}
{"source": "This is not a massive cabinet, so you aren't going to get that &#34;big&#34; a sound, regardless"}
{"source": " But for a small room it's great!Common complaint I have seen:  No clean channel/preset"}
{"source": "This is not the case"}
{"source": "  There are a couple of factory presets that are &#34;clean&#34; although some people want cleaner"}
{"source": "  You can either adjust the gain/vol yourself or download one of several VERY nice very clean presets from the fender forums"}
{"source": "  That said, one of my guitars is edgy, it wants to overdrive the amp"}
{"source": "  Another doesn't, and is very clean, even on the factory preset clean"}
{"source": "I very nearly got a different amp"}
{"source": "  I went to a music store and a salesman showed me a Mustang II"}
{"source": "  I was sold when he showed me what all it could do - then showed me the price for a Mustang I!!  For ~$100 USD this is about as much as you could possibly ask for"}
{"source": "It'll keep me busy for a long time"}
{"source": "I bought this amp to use for practicing the electric guitar"}
{"source": " There is so much debate out there about amps vs solid state (this is a solid state)"}
{"source": " People will make ridiculous claims if you choose not to purchase a $400 tube amp to practice through"}
{"source": " (&#34;You're not getting the right tone, man"}
{"source": "&#34; The problem with that is, there are several companies out there Marshall, Fender, Vox, Orange, etc"}
{"source": "and they all have a variety of tube amps to choose from and they all begin in price around this one"}
{"source": " So, I figured, before I committed to a company, maybe I could just use this Fender to emulate some of those sounds I want"}
{"source": "That worked out beautifully"}
{"source": " Though I am very much a beginner, I have a greater appreciation for the nuances an amp's eq can have on your guitar's tone"}
{"source": " I thought I needed pedals to have some of these effects, instead I can just change the channel to a preset and there is all the flanger/reverb/modulation I need"}
{"source": " I have got to the point where I understand about how just adjusting my volume/switching pickups and using the built in guitar knobs can alter my tone enough to stand out when I want to"}
{"source": "I would not have been able to do that without this amp"}
{"source": " This amp helped me develop as a beginner so I wouldn't waste money buying other things, beginners think they should get"}
{"source": " Excellent amp and I recommend getting this over the Mustang II"}
{"source": " Save the difference for your real amp that will come when you actually know a little more"}
{"source": "I bought this along with a new guitar for my daughter, as she is learning to play"}
{"source": " My son has also joined in the fun"}
{"source": " This is a pretty complex amp, and will require quite a bit of time to figure out everything that it can do"}
{"source": " It can be a little daunting for a newbie"}
{"source": "My first review was a knee-jerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it"}
{"source": "  I couldn't get it to sound like I wanted it to"}
{"source": "I WAS SO WRONG IN GIVING IT ONLY 2 STARS"}
{"source": "I must now rerate it with a 5 star"}
{"source": "  This amp does almost too much for the money"}
{"source": "  My only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has"}
{"source": "  It can do ANYTHING and sound any way you want it too"}
{"source": "WOW, I never knew my guitar could sound like this"}
{"source": "  It actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have"}
{"source": "  I am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite Amp when I totally figure it out, if I ever do"}
{"source": "  The sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settings"}
{"source": "So, in short, forgive me as I have sinned and judged too early"}
{"source": "  BUY this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it"}
{"source": "  If you are looking for a small, plug and play amp"}
{"source": "this isn't it"}
{"source": "  But it you're looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities"}
{"source": " this IS it"}
{"source": "  It is growing on me and I wouldn't part with it now"}
{"source": "Luv it, I had version #1 and this amp isnt much different"}
{"source": "they both are cheap and sound great plus u can connect to the computer software"}
{"source": "Do not expect this to sound like a Fender Frontman with 2 x 12\" speakers"}
{"source": " But for practicing in your bedroom or similar it's perfect"}
{"source": " Plenty of sound effects to mess around with"}
{"source": " Are they as good as dedicated $100 per stomp box effects? Probably not, but so what"}
{"source": " Just found out the best part of this amp"}
{"source": " You can connect it via the USB port to your PC not only for using the rather cheesy Fender software, but it lets you pipe your guitar's sounds into software like Garage Band"}
{"source": " You can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an M-Audio M-Track or similar"}
{"source": " PS: It is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the MIC or LINE IN in of your computer (even with the right adapter plugs) as the impedances will not be right"}
{"source": " On top of that, I have connected the Mac's headphone audio out to the amp's AUX in! Sounds MUCH better than listening to the PC's normal puny speakers"}
{"source": "UPDATE: While the built in USB interface does work, a dedicated device with good pre-amps like the Focusrite 2i2 is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer"}
{"source": "UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: While I am keeping this amp for convenience I have quickly learned that NOTHING can match a real tube amp"}
{"source": " You can simulate all you want (and I am talking much more expensive SW solutions, its like imitation chocolate vs"}
{"source": " REAL chocolate"}
{"source": " Got the Marshall DSL 40 Watt combo"}
{"source": " Amazing sound"}
{"source": "The concept of this guitar stand is great, and I thought it would be perfect for my two Telecasters"}
{"source": "That is until I get the stands in place and put the guitars in them"}
{"source": " The stands have a very deep angle, and from what I could tell, the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees back"}
{"source": "It just looks silly, like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand, or are in a slow-motion fall backwards"}
{"source": " It also ends up taking up WAY too much space, as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes"}
{"source": " I ended up returning these stands, but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version"}
{"source": "Works great, does what it should, holds all my guitars securely"}
{"source": "  acoustic and electric, but not at the same time"}
{"source": "  haha"}
{"source": "I like the fact is foldable and can be put away or carried easily"}
{"source": " The biggest down side is the angle that the guitar sits, the lean is to far back so you'll need to keep it further from walls than usual"}
{"source": " Other wise good deal"}
{"source": "YES, DEAR READER, THIS STAND WILL WORK AS A GOOD SUPPORT STAND FOR NOT ONLY MY GRAND CONCERT SIZE ACOUSTIC GUITAR, FOR  MY FIVE- STRING BANJO (WITH RESONATOR), AND"}
{"source": "ALSO  FOR MY BARITONE UKULELE"}
{"source": "  THE STAND IS"}
{"source": "STURDY, PROVIDES GOOD SUPPORT, AND LOOKS GOOD"}
{"source": "  I AM PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE"}
{"source": " AND WILL PROBABLY BUY ANOTHER JUST LIKE IT FOR MY BANJO"}
{"source": " THE PACKAGE ARRIVED IN TIME AND WAS PROTECTED BY AN ADEQUATE SHIPPING CONTAINER"}
{"source": "The stand works great"}
{"source": " It supports my Casio CTK6250 on the shortest level and can go pretty high as well"}
{"source": " This thing folds up so it is easy for storing"}
{"source": " It is a bit heavy, but that allows it to support almost any keyboard"}
{"source": " This is by far the most stable keyboard stand out there and a great price too"}
{"source": "I received a MIM Stratocaster as a gift a year ago"}
{"source": " Recently, I noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp"}
{"source": " After tracing the issue, I discovered there was some play in the Strat's jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip"}
{"source": " A quick fix was to bend the jack's connector end, but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open, making a minor gap where there wasn't that positive connection"}
{"source": "I've purchased several Switchcraft jacks and they just work"}
{"source": " Stronger, more flexible metal, easy soldering, good materials"}
{"source": " It's a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection"}
{"source": " Obviously, because the finish is chromed, oxidation can get in the way of the connection, but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied"}
{"source": " If oxidation/wear is an issue, Switchcraft makes gold-plated jacks"}
{"source": " However, I just love these jacks, and for the price, they really can't be beat"}
{"source": "I didnt have any issue with this when I went to put it in my strat build"}
{"source": " Not a lot to say about it really"}
{"source": " Its metal and it works"}
{"source": " Switchcraft is usually a good product"}
{"source": "Every once and a while I play the bass guitar and while I use the Snark for my guitars, itwill not tune the bass; this tuner does a great job of that task, plus the guitar"}
{"source": "I bought this due to the constant problem of getting that awful out-of-tune twang with my previous Planet Waves capo when I would try to reset the capo on a different fret"}
{"source": "  Planet Waves capos are awesome, don't get me wrong but this one is specialized for acoustic and works wonderfully"}
{"source": "First let's get the easy stuff done with"}
{"source": "  This capo is beautiful,  It is clean with an even silver matte finish that looks good in the box (nice packaging) and equally good on the guitar"}
{"source": "The capo is solid, the spring mechanism feels good in the hand and when it clamps down on the neck you can see (and hear) there was thought put into the capo to make sure the pressure on the string is even and the neck is well protected"}
{"source": " No sharp points to damage the guitar"}
{"source": "  And this thing is easy to use, squeeze, put on neck, done"}
{"source": "  You could easily move this during a gig and then store it on the edge of your neck when not using it"}
{"source": "  I tried this on my acoustics and electric and was happy with both"}
{"source": "  When playing the strings behave as normal"}
{"source": "  No odd muting or dropouts"}
{"source": "  The capo is solid on the neck"}
{"source": "I have to say I have not used a capo in a while because the one I have is pain"}
{"source": "  With this new capo I am happy to use it"}
{"source": "  This thing is great!  Easy to use, efficient, sturdy, looks nice and SOUNDS GREAT!"}
{"source": "Good spring action, made pretty solid"}
{"source": " No buzzing on the strings when I put it on"}
{"source": " The lifetime warranty is what I am stoked about I will probably buy two more for my other guitars"}
{"source": " Highly recommend it"}
{"source": "I received these TASCAM headphones as part of the Amazon Vine review program"}
{"source": "  I was excited to receive them, as I've looked at them many times and considered ordering due to the reasonable price point and 'professional grade' designation"}
{"source": "I'm not an audiophile, nor am I snob about audio devices"}
{"source": "  Any brand that works well at the right price, I'll buy it"}
{"source": "  That being said, I've recently been fortunate enough to get to try out lots of headphones, with theBose AE2w Bluetooth Headphones - Blackbeing the most recent"}
{"source": "Obviously the Bose beat the TASCAM ones, so it would be unfair to compare them other than to say that 'sound wise' you can really tell a difference in the mid and high range"}
{"source": "  These TASCAM TH-2000-R 'Professional Grade' Headphones don't sound clear to me in the mid and high ranges"}
{"source": "  Bass is great, but even when tweaking the equalizer settings I never could find the clarity I was seeking in the full range"}
{"source": "I listened to several genres: Classical, Blues, Pop, Rock, Electronic, Country, and Latino with these headphones"}
{"source": "  Each time, the quality was good, but not great despite attempted software and device adjustments on my iPhone, PC andYamaha RX-V675 7"}
{"source": "2 Channel Network 3D AV Receiver with Airplay (Black)"}
{"source": "The fit of the headphones is big for me"}
{"source": "  Usually, they are too small"}
{"source": "  Having them as small as I could make them (top of my head to ears), the cups still dropped down a bit lower than I liked"}
{"source": " I had to hold them in place to get a solid fit"}
{"source": "  The padding underneath the headpiece is minimal, and after about 15 minutes of use the top of my head hurt"}
{"source": "The build quality of these phones appears to be excellent"}
{"source": " The cord is thick and can be extended to an estimated 6'"}
{"source": "  The screw on adapter: 1/8(3"}
{"source": "5mm) to 1/4(6"}
{"source": "3mm) allows for use with multiple devices, stereo components and sound boards"}
{"source": "  The foldable design does allow for some size reduction, but not much"}
{"source": "These headphones will appeal to those who like heavy bass"}
{"source": "  Great for those who want the chunky headset look, are on the go DJing, and/or have larger heads"}
{"source": "They are not for those looking for a wide range and subtlety in their listening"}
{"source": "  They're also not for those with smaller heads"}
{"source": "These headphones are almost perfect"}
{"source": " The sound is great, good balance between highs and lows"}
{"source": " They are comfortable too as far as ear pads go"}
{"source": " The only problem is the size"}

{"source": "To describe my impressions of the TH-2000-S versus my well-used Sennheiser HD-201s I chose a few favorite reference tracks that illustrate different instrumental timbres and production values:  I like to use recordings I know well so I can quickly detect varying emphasis in frequency response and clarity"}
{"source": "Andres Segovia - `Variations on a Spanish Folk Tune - Narvaez' from `My Favorite Spanish Encores'"}
{"source": "In my opinion one of the finest recordings of solo classical guitar I've ever heard, both for the performance and the sheer beauty of sound"}
{"source": "  The distinguishing points of this opening piece are the bass notes that Segovia's arrangement of the original vihuela-texture really emphasize"}
{"source": " For me there's a difference between bass presence and bass clarity: I'll gladly trade less `oomph' in the gut for the kind of definition the Tascam's bring out:  warm, well-defined, with a crisp and clear treble edge"}
{"source": " The Sennheisers, while equally balanced, were far muddier and less defined at the low end with less presence and sparkle on top"}
{"source": " They were also considerably quieter and this applies across the board - the TH-2000-S just puts out a lot more sound at similar volume settings"}
{"source": "Jeff Beck `You Know What I Mean' from `Blow By Blow'"}
{"source": "The George Martin production remains for me one of the most colorful instrumental electric guitar records ever made"}
{"source": "  The clean separation and space in the mix between guitar, electric piano, clavinet, bass and drums is always a joy to hear on a good sound system"}
{"source": " The TH-2000s again demonstrated more punch in the mids and bottom end than the Sennheisers and overall more presence"}
{"source": " It's a 24-bit recording and this is the first time I can honestly say I hear the difference - like being there in the control room, seriously"}
{"source": " There's a greyness to the Sennheisers that frankly never bothered me before, but after hearing the Tascam phones, I doubt I'll ever be satisfied with less again"}
{"source": "Stravinsky Violin Concerto - Anne Sophie Mutter from `Mutter Modern'"}
{"source": "The words I keep coming back to are `presence' and `clarity'"}
{"source": " I can hear string attacks, counter voices in woodwinds and an increase in overall spaciousness with the TH-2000-S that I simply don't hear with the Sennheiser phones"}
{"source": "As far as craftsmanship, the TH-2000-S weighs more than my other phones and much of that weight is in the band rather than the cups"}
{"source": " The sliding cup adjustment is easy to move yet ratcheted to stay in place securely when removing the phones casually"}
{"source": " The cup mounts are really well-designed and allow fine-grained 4-way rotation that guarantees a snug fit regardless of the size and shape of your head and ears"}
{"source": " I like the balanced feel and snug fit on my admittedly large head"}
{"source": " The 2-3\" cushion along the inside of the band and in particular the adds comfort"}
{"source": "The cord is a hybrid - the 2-3' closest to the phones is flat 1/8\" diameter, well-insulated 'matte-finish' and flexible"}
{"source": " Beyond that there's another foot of coiled wire that will comfortably expand another 3-4 feet"}
{"source": "  I think it's a nice compromise that's probably biased towards most users sitting fairly close to an output jack - you can avoid having to deal with excess cord unless you need to"}
{"source": "As we get older our hearing changes: for most people it's a decrease in high-frequency response but it also occur across the entire spectrum"}

{"source": " I'd encourage anyone excited by quality sound to experiment and these Tascam TH-2000-S are a good place to start"}
{"source": "The TASCAM TH-2000 headphones are like putting a pair of studio monitors on your ears! They are great! Excellent bass response (not muddy at all), tight mids, and clear highs"}
{"source": " To boot, they are extremely comfortable as well"}
{"source": " The foam fits nicely around your ears, conforming to the contours of your face"}
{"source": " They are adjustable, so if you have a huge head you can still wear these"}
{"source": " The only drawback that I can see, and I don't really even consider this a negative, is the coiled cord"}
{"source": " Some people may not like that"}
{"source": " All in all these are great headphones - I have listened to all varieties of music with them, monitored recordings with them, etc"}
{"source": " excellent! By the way, they also are pretty good at cancelling extraneous noise in the background, making the music come out clearer"}

{"source": " So its a give and take issue"}
{"source": "The EXH Hot Tubes compact pedal offers a very unique sound and is difficult to review from an objective standpoint"}
{"source": "  I had no knowledge of or experience with the original full-sized Hot Tubes pedal from the late 1970's"}
{"source": "  And, frankly, many of the reviews I read online about both the original and the reissue were less than flattering"}
{"source": "  I think part of that hatred comes from the fact that you have an analog pedal without actual tubes that claims (both in the name of the device and in the artwork on the casing) to sound like an overdriven tube amplifier"}
{"source": "  Really, though, if you think about it, doesn't EVERY overdrive pedal (including the venerable Tubescreamer) make that same claim?When I plugged into the Hot Tubes, I was surprised, but immediately intrigued"}
{"source": "  I actually ended up purchasing this over the excellent East River Drive, which was very good, but also a very &#34;familiar&#34; sounding clone of a TS-808"}
{"source": "  What the Hot Tubes does is anything but &#34;familiar&#34; from an affordable OD pedal"}
{"source": "This pedal has a significant amount of output, and (unlike many other overdrives) it has considerable low end"}
{"source": "  In fact, it likely even adds bass to your sound"}
{"source": "  There is a tone circuit bypass switch that I do not fully understand"}
{"source": "  Basically, with the switch off, there is no tone control, and they advertise this sound as &#34;powerful&#34; and touch-responsive"}
{"source": " Since the pedal trends to the darker side of things, however, I actually left it in the &#34;on&#34; position and worked the tone from the 12:00 to 1:30 settings"}
{"source": "The gain structure is as bizarre as it is unique, though it actually starts to make sense if you think about how gain responds on an actual vintage tube amp"}
{"source": "  From the 7:00 (0%) setting up to around 12:00, your tone basically remains clean, provided you started with a clean signal"}
{"source": "  My setup was a Strat into a Fender Super Champ X2, which is a tube/hybrid amp with a great clean &#34;Blackface&#34; setting"}
{"source": "  However, the Hot Tubes completely transforms that tone"}
{"source": "  That setting on my amp is normally bright with some great upper end chime, but the Hot Tubes offered a thick, smokey tone that was mostly clean, with maybe a bit of muffled grit mixed into it"}
{"source": "As you start get past 12:00 on the overdrive knob, the amount of gain increases exponentially"}
{"source": "  At this point, the pedal behaves more like an overdrive, though the gain is almost fuzz-like"}
{"source": "  Some people have described it as a &#34;Jack White&#34; type of sound, but I'll really leave it to individual users to decide if they &#34;like&#34; it or not"}
{"source": "There are aspects of this pedal you could be objectively critical about"}
{"source": "  First, I want to make clear that this is a DARK, bassy pedal"}
{"source": "  In that respect, it is completely different from the EXH Soul Food and East River Drive, both of which have some measure of bass drop"}
{"source": "  The tone circuit only helps to open up the tone a slight bit, but it could do more"}
{"source": "  I do not believe this is the type of overdrive you would stack with - it might actually benefit from a brighter overdrive stacking INTO it"}
{"source": "  If your rig is already on the dark or muffled side, you may want to stay away from this pedal"}
{"source": "  That being said, I would definitely recommend &#34;try before buy&#34; with this one because it is different in hard-to-describe ways"}
{"source": "For now, my rating is 5 stars - solid EHX construction, very compact, accessible 9V jack (on the top where it I like it), and a unique overdrive sound at an affordable price that doesn't sound at all like the other overdrives I have"}
{"source": "  It certainly won't be for everybody, but so far, I like what I hear"}
{"source": "THIS is truly the bestest bangest for your buckest! I've tried dozens of od pedals in the past, (I hate this term) boutiques and non boutiques before I finally stick with SS/BS Mini OD as my always-on pedal cos that thing is a supersonic bad ass since it could cover my needs on clean boost, edge-of-breakup \"clean\" sound, distortion, or even a messed up broken speaker fuzz tonez"}
{"source": " only with your guitar volume knob! (please note that you'll need to have a treble bleed circuit to do this)Okay back to this EHX, I'm kinda tired of messing around with guitar volume knob on the mini so I bought this Hot Tubes as my \"clean\" breakup sound so that I could hit it hard with a cranked up Mini OD"}
{"source": " And this, my friend"}
{"source": " JESUS APPROVED! The point is, this pedal's so great and has a great range of dirt"}
{"source": " also works awesome with your guitar vol knob as well for the gain range"}
{"source": " It's literally like an overdrive coming from a tube amps"}
{"source": " I can be really fussy about od pedals but this one is a keeper!PS: Look at the price"}
{"source": " do you really have to overthink on getting this pedal? Just get it, try it, and see if you like it, jeez! :-)"}
{"source": "This thing is incredibly cool"}
{"source": "  Double the record time of the closest competitor- the TC Ditto- and about twenty bucks cheaper"}
{"source": "  Your loop can be as long as 10 minutes, with unlimited over-dubbing"}
{"source": "  This pedal sold out in about a day on most of the big retailers- likely due to pre-order obligations and a delayed release"}
{"source": "  It was worth the wait"}
{"source": "  You can add layer after layer of sound to build a wall of music"}
{"source": "  It's a really cool tool for jamming, performing, or composing"}
{"source": "  Operation is simple- press once to record"}
{"source": "  Press again and it begins playback"}
{"source": "  Press a third time to dub on top of your last layer"}
{"source": "  If you make a mistake, press and hold- it will erase your last dub"}
{"source": "  Tap twice to stop play of the loop"}
{"source": "  Press and hold while stopped and you will erase the whole thing"}
{"source": "  Switch is a soft switch, so there is no click"}
{"source": "  It is very responsive to pressure"}
{"source": "  There is a single knob to control the volume of the loop"}
{"source": "  Nicely done, Digitech ;)"}
{"source": "At the time of me writing this review, these little guys are hard to find and keep selling out quickly"}
{"source": "  I was lucky enough to get my hands on one early"}
{"source": "  I almost purchased the very nice Ditto Looper when I started looking for a small and simple looper pedal"}
{"source": "  The Ditto is great and should be considered if you are in the market for a tiny looper pedal that does nothing but loop well and at an affordable price"}
{"source": "  That said, the Digitech Express XT is a little better"}
{"source": "  Both work well but the Digitech has a few more features in almost as small of a foot print"}
{"source": "  Here are those features"}
{"source": "  The Digitech takes batteries or a power adapter, is cheaper than the Ditto, has 5 more minutes of looping memory, can be daisy chained to other Digitech loopers for multi-tracking and they synch, has LED lights so you know where you are, and it has stereo in/out"}
{"source": "  None of these are deal breakers alone but together and currently for 30 bucks less, the Digitech Express XT is the clear winner IMHO if you can find one to buy"}
{"source": "this is a simple loop effects pedal which makes awesome quality loops and unlimited dubs"}
{"source": "  you can jam for hours with this thing, it's awesome"}
{"source": "I purchased this pedal at a local music store for practice and possibly doing some loops at open mics with my Roland GR55 (which has a flawless basic looper built in, but only 20 seconds record and no undo)"}
{"source": " I had hoped that it would at least last one hour on with a battery so that I wouldn't need to carry a power adapter along"}
{"source": "The factory battery lasted about 1 hour"}
{"source": " The second brand new fresh Duracell battery lasted about 20 minutes"}
{"source": " I started recording a loop with another (3rd) fresh battery (tested 9"}
{"source": "10 v with a multimeter) and the unit started behaving erratically after a few seconds of recording, suggesting that it was faulty"}
{"source": " The lights started coming on and off randomly (record/undo/all three together, then off, then undo on, then all three on etc"}
{"source": " etc"}
{"source": ")The first time I used the JamMan XT (with the factory battery) it seemed to be working OK and all I can say is that as a basic looper it sucked"}
{"source": "I am used to synching loops with other loopers and timing is everything, so I know it was not my poor technique"}
{"source": " The main problem was that it didn't matter how hard I tried (even if I did a manual fade out) there was always a gap of about 2 seconds between the end of the loop and the start"}
{"source": " This makes the unit useless"}
{"source": "Also, it is poorly conceived in that, to replace the battery you have to take out 2 screws"}
{"source": " exposing the delicate printed circuit board"}
{"source": "The potential for damage here is very high"}
{"source": " Also, replacing the screws needs to be done very carefully to avoid cross threading the screws and messing up the receiver nuts which are mounted directly onto the circuit board"}
{"source": " To save a few dollars Digitech did not have the foresight to manufacture the unit with a battery box which would have protected the electronics and possible (read INEVITABLE) damage"}
{"source": "I have owned quite a few Digitech products over the years and generally they are well thought out and well constructed but they have really dropped the ball on this one"}
{"source": "It's going back to the store where I purchased it"}
{"source": "remember those little sticky gummi hand things that you used to get out of the quarter machine at the grocery store?Sticky Hands - 12 per unitThese are kinda like that, but a little thicker and shaped into blue rectangles that are approximately 1\" x 2\""}
{"source": "you can stick them to any part of your drum head to dampen sound as needed"}
{"source": " They even work on cymbals if you're looking for a quicker decay!The closer to the center (or more pads you use), the more dramatic the effect"}
{"source": " You can also cut them to get more pieces out of them if needed"}
{"source": " If you drop them or they end up getting too dirty to stick to anything, you can wash them in the sink with dish soap and air dry them"}
{"source": "I've been using them for years and they work amazingly!"}
{"source": "I really wanted to like these, but they're a frickin, lint-catching sticky frickin' mess! They went from my wife's snare back into the holder in a New York Minute, have never seen the light of day, and may have been thrown in the garbage"}
{"source": " Save your money"}
{"source": " We use a heavy stoneware coaster with a cork back to quieten her snare now"}
{"source": "Added December 5:Has yet to fall off the fiddle scroll again so the 5 star rating stands without an asterisk"}
{"source": "Added November 8:I put the star back"}
{"source": "  I've got (another) one on one of my banjos"}
{"source": "  It does require a teeny bit of twisting a neck (either mine or the banjo's!) to see it clearly, but the size is more convenient if you want to carry it in your pocket and there's no neck to snap"}
{"source": "While it may have some trouble staying affixed to a fiddle's scroll, it seems firmly rooted to the banjo's headstock"}
{"source": "-------------------------Original November 4:This tuner has a display like the SN-8 rather than the SN-1 after which it is named"}
{"source": " It's like any other Snark Super tight Tuner"}
{"source": "I've taken off 1 star for two reasons:(1) I find I have to twist either my neck or my instrument uncomfortably to use it"}
{"source": " Maybe it's just a matter of finding the right place to put it"}
{"source": "  I'll keep trying"}
{"source": "(2) My music partner immediately adopted it for her fiddle thinking she could leave it on all the time"}
{"source": "  It was clamped solidly on the scroll but, to do that and have it be comfortable to read, the tuner was hanging down while playing"}
{"source": "  Eventually it slipped off"}
{"source": "  If it weren't kept on, this wouldn't be an issue, but that's how the advertising shows the tuner being used--clamped to a guitar headstock, hanging down"}
{"source": " I'll report back if it doesn't happen again for a while"}
{"source": " Even if this *is* an issue, its small square shape makes it very easy to slip into a pocket while not in use, so I still think it's worth 4 stars"}
{"source": "This works well"}
{"source": "  Has nice ergonomics, fits all of my acoustic guitars, and is easy to use"}
{"source": "  No adjustments are required for my guitars, but it is nice to know that the options is available for this capo"}
{"source": "This capo comes with a pick holder"}
{"source": "  And, it is expandable with aD'Addario NS Micro Clip-On Tunerthat attaches onto the lower arm"}
{"source": "  I do not use a pick, and I use my own tuners, so neither of these two features is applicable for my needs"}
{"source": "This capo has moved up as one of two highly used capos for my guitars, the other one being theG7th Performance Capo"}
{"source": "  The G7 capo goes with my Takamine New Yorker, and this Planet Waves goes on everything else"}
{"source": "  If anyone needs to use a capo, I loan out myKyser Capo"}
{"source": "Recommended"}
{"source": "I have the original version of this capo and it works just fine as does this one"}
{"source": "  However, it seems theu have made a slight modification which increases its value from my viewpoint"}
{"source": "  Yhey have added a channel on the capo onto which slides a bracket which is included"}
{"source": "  This bracket holds the NS micro tuner, of which I have 3"}
{"source": "  I had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications"}
{"source": "  However, now, this ingenious little bracket enables me to use a tuner in tandem or not depending on my need"}
{"source": "  A simple modification, but bordering on genius"}
{"source": "  The capo itdelf id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screw/spring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed"}
{"source": "  Highly recommended"}
{"source": "I have been playing guitar for more years than I care to admit"}
{"source": " Okay I bought a 1966 Telecaster brand new back then"}
{"source": " Still have it and love it"}
{"source": " I have a lot of different guitars, mostly electric, and 4 acoustics"}
{"source": " On my electrics I love extra light 8 gauge strings"}
{"source": " (Only about 5% of us do) I can fly on those and do things at a pace this is a lot more difficult with heavier gauge strings"}
{"source": " Anyhow I digress, but for a reason"}
{"source": " Light gauge strings are subject to tuning problems if you have big fat frets like the "}
{"source": "050&#34; found on Gibons and ESP-LTD's"}
{"source": " When you squeeze the string to fret it, with light gauge strings it is all too easy to squeeze it all the way to the fret board"}
{"source": " With X-Large jumbo frets that can be quite a distance making the guitar go out of tune"}
{"source": " The cure for that is using heavier gauge strings such as 10's or more so it makes it possible to determine quite easily just where the top of the fret is without doing the full squeeze all the way to the fret board"}
{"source": " So most capo's work with 10's and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings"}
{"source": " So a lot of capos can create a comfortable fit fully fretting the strings without them going into the sharp note zone"}
{"source": "So since I use lighter gauge strings, and even 9's are subject to the same limitation, I have had a hard time finding a capo that would sit comfortably at the top of the range between the fret and the board, and still squeeze the string sufficiently so as to not create any buzz and do so without making the string too sharp"}
{"source": " Guess what? Now I found it"}
{"source": " I have several capos and none of them make the grade for light gauge strings except this one"}
{"source": " To be honest with you I was surprised when it worked"}
{"source": "Okay so here is how I put it to the test"}
{"source": " I used the Snark headstock tuner which is a great little tuner if you know the secret to using it"}
{"source": " I also have the Peterson HD tuner bench model which is fodder for another post with its one tenth of one cent tuning accuracy"}
{"source": " Okay back to the explanation"}
{"source": "With the Snark you tune the open string until the line stays in the center without wavering off to one side"}
{"source": " The only problem is that most any headstock tuner I have seen they aren't superbly accurate"}
{"source": " (The Peterson headstock tuner I sent back because it was acting crazy"}
{"source": " Anyhow"}
{"source": ") So the secret to using the Snark which I like best out of the headstock tuners I have tried is to tune the open string first, and then fret the string on let's say the 5th fret"}
{"source": " You will occasionally find that a string in the open position registers as being in tune, even though it may be a little sharp, or a little flat, so when you strum the whole chord you will get a desire to tune it, so your ears can hear it, in order to get it spot on"}
{"source": " There is nothing more beautiful than a perfectly tuned guitar, and nothing worse than one that is well out of tune"}
{"source": "So by tuning the open string, and then tuning the fretted string, once both are in tune it is right on"}
{"source": " So in the open position if by chance it is a tiny bit sharp, not enough to register on the tuner, when you fret that string, for example on the 5th fret that naturally stretches the string a little bit, making it sharper, which will now show on the Snark as a note that is too sharp"}
{"source": " Once you balance the open string, and the fretted string you really have a wonderfully tuned instrument"}
{"source": " You don't even need to hear it"}
{"source": " So your audience is not listening to you tune up, yet you get it right in the sweet spot that we all love and know so well"}
{"source": "So with that being said you can more fully understand why this D'Addario NS Artist Capo is the cat&#8217;s meow"}
{"source": " It is the first tuner that I ever used that kept the guitar perfectly in tune after clamping it on the neck"}
{"source": " (It is adjustable like the others are, but this one is sensitive for light gauge strings as well)You often see artists trimming up their tuning after putting on the capo; not with this one even with light gauge strings"}
{"source": " I must admit I was surprised taking it right out of the wrapper, after going through the above tuning procedure to get the guitar spot on, that it immediately did the job just right"}
{"source": " It wasn't even a little bit sharp"}
{"source": "To be super critical here is another tip"}
{"source": " When using this capo put it closer to the fret, rather than in the middle between two frets"}
{"source": " For some reason it stretches the string less in doing so"}
{"source": " It has to do with the tension resistance at a steeper angle right alongside of a fret, rather than farther way like in the middle between the two frets"}
{"source": " I did get a tiny bit of sharpness when positioned between the two frets"}
{"source": " (With 8 gauge strings)Since the two most important factors are that it is comfortable to use, not getting in the way when playing open chords and keeping the guitar in tune"}
{"source": " The best way to use this capo is to simply clamp the strings right above the second fret for example, rather than right below the third one"}
{"source": " Right below the third one gives you that perfect tune also, just like right above the second one does, but it keeps the capo way out of your way"}
{"source": " As a matter of fact I am so accustomed to using the capo position to know where to finger the chords, that I sometimes make a mistake and fret them one lower than they belong"}
{"source": " With a little practice, or not even looking at the guitar instantly corrects that"}
{"source": " To say this quite simply is to say use this capo farther away from your hand"}
{"source": " You just slide it down to being right above the fret below it, rather than right below the fret above it"}
{"source": "So there it is"}
{"source": " This Capo does the job perfectly and is light and easy to clamp"}
{"source": " Of course if it can accurately handle 8's it will breeze through anything thicker"}
{"source": " Out of the box it is set at its lightest setting, and that is perfect for 8's on the Telecaster I tried it on"}
{"source": " Teles and Strats really have the same neck just with different head stocks"}
{"source": " So it will work the same with both"}
{"source": "So I guess I can't recommend this capo high enough since it is the ONLY one that works perfectly with super light gauge strings"}
{"source": " My only problem is being sure to remember which guitar case it is in so I can switch it over when using a different guitar"}
{"source": " I might get another one for a backup"}
{"source": "I completely agree with &#34;JPfromOH&#34;"}
{"source": "This Planet Waves D'Addario Artist Capo tries to be too many things and winds up doing none of them perfectly"}
{"source": "The micro-adjusting knob for tweaking tension/pressure is nice, but I've wound up having to mess about with it repeatedly with every guitar/ukulele that I have"}
{"source": "  (A standard tension spring might be a bit too firm, but at least it's consistent"}
{"source": ")I also thought I'd like the curved cradle for the neck, but it winds up pushing the capo to odd positions on one of my guitars and makes it very uncomfortable to play with on my tenor ukulele"}
{"source": " I know, I know, this isn't designed for ukuleles, but I have no such troubles with my Kyser capos"}
{"source": "I don't understand the clip for a tuner on this thing"}
{"source": "  I have several clip-on tuners that clip directly to the headstock"}
{"source": " (And most are Planet Waves already!)  Why would I want to purchase a separate tuner that can only be used when I'm using the capo?  I suppose that if you have money to burn, this is a useful addition"}
{"source": "And the pick holder is a nice touch, but"}
{"source": " I use my fingernails so that feature is needless for me"}
{"source": "As others have noted, there are other, better capos out there"}
{"source": "For years I used Kyser capos and the handle for them always sticks out and that can be an issue"}
{"source": " Planet Waves' NS has a smoother handle that doesn't stick out as much and i've had no issues with gripping it on or off so far"}
{"source": " It is easy to put on and off and it holds the strings down properly"}
{"source": " If you're looking to buy a capo i'd recommend this over a Kyser"}
{"source": "I am a fan of Planet Waves NS capos, but this new one is not very well designed"}
{"source": " The way it sits on the guitar is sort of backwards"}
{"source": " I find my left hand hitting the lever when I'm in open position"}
{"source": " Frustrating"}
{"source": " It does have a pick holder, which can be handy, and a place to put an NS tuner, which can also be handy"}
{"source": " I just think it could have been better designed"}
{"source": " I don't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff"}
{"source": " I'll stick to my other NS Planet Waves capo or my old faithful Kyser"}
{"source": "The Planet Waves D'Addario Artist Capo seems like a classic case of trying to do everything and not quite getting it right as a result"}
{"source": "  The capo has a micro-adjusting knob, but it is into as consistent with acoustic guitars, such as my Seagull that have non-standard width fretboards"}
{"source": "  The built-in pick holder is useful, but Planet Waves offers another, less &#34;Artist&#34; model that also has one"}
{"source": "  In fact, the other Planet Waves capo I have is much more amenable to different width necks than this one"}
{"source": "  The Artist capo also has an adapter that allows The player to attach one of those small clip-on tuners directly too  the capo"}
{"source": "  Assuming that you don't use the capo constantly, why would you want to clip the tuner to the capo instead of to the guitar's headstock?  Check out other offerings from Planet Waves; you can do better for less than with this one"}
{"source": "Always looking for that elusive perfect capo, light yet strong and dependably firm?You just found it"}
{"source": "This is an exemplary capo"}
{"source": " No surprise, as it's designed by Ned Steinberger, who understands what it means to strip a guitar down to the basics"}
{"source": " It's made of serious aluminum and the spring is super-solid"}
{"source": " The tighten feature means you can put it on your guitar and then tighten it so well that it won't come off again until you loosen it"}
{"source": " No slippage here! This also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so it's even less in the way of your hand, a very useful feature which most other one-hand capos can't offer"}
{"source": "It's an easy on-in-seconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets"}
{"source": " The rubber is well-bonded and looks unlikely to pull off for years at least, unlike many cheap capos"}
{"source": " It sits well on any six-string, though is not flat enough for a classical"}
{"source": " But most of us use capos mainly for acoustic and maybe a bit of electric (unless you're Albert Collins, who always used one and would have loved the tightening aspect here), so this will cover all your basic capo needs"}
{"source": "It's got a little slot for the D'Addario brand tuner, but I use a Snark and these two go together well; put on the capo, activate the tuner on the headstock, tune it up, and away you go, perfectly in tune in seconds while using a capo! If you've ever suffered onstage while switching frets with a capo, this is a godsend combo"}
{"source": " The capo also has a little pick slot, which will comfortably take up to about a "}
{"source": "73 mm pick"}
{"source": " It fits "}
{"source": "60 picks perfectly, by the way"}
{"source": "This NS Artist Capo is well worth 20-25 bucks, and since I got it my Shubb and Kysers have sat lonely in the corner"}
{"source": "If you haven't ever experimented with capos, try them out"}
{"source": " They can really change the way you play your guitar, and may help you find you sing better than you think, as we all have our best keys, and a capo can help you find yours"}
{"source": " I love playing bluegrass licks in G while capoed at the second fret, for instance"}
{"source": " The extra zing and crisper tone make me play different licks and it's almost like another instrument"}
{"source": " This goes for every fret, pretty much, up to about the sixth, where it gets a little cramped"}
{"source": "All in all, this is the best capo I've ever used, especially for this quality at this price"}
{"source": "I have to confess to a particular image that comes to mind when I think of capos"}
{"source": "  It's the image of an earnest folkie, with mastery of C, G and D, but still struggling with the A"}
{"source": " A good player should be comfortable in any key"}
{"source": "  But there's still an occasional place for a capo, and that's when you need open strings in a chord"}
{"source": "I tested this capo on several guitars, and with one exception it worked well"}
{"source": "  Steel-string dreadnought, archtop jazz box, and Les Paul worked nicely"}
{"source": "  Not so much on a flat fretboard classical"}
{"source": "  The capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck"}
{"source": "  But on a flat neck there's a little string buzz on the D and G strings"}
{"source": "  While the capo's grip is good, it still needs to be fitted right behind the fret"}
{"source": "  This means that it can get a little bit in the way for passage work"}
{"source": " That's probably a rare problem for the intended user"}
{"source": "All in all it's a nice little capo"}
{"source": "  Goes on and off with no fuss and fits the majority of necks"}
{"source": "This is the best capo we have (out of three)"}
{"source": " We were not unhappy with the others until we received this one"}
{"source": "Pros:Easy to use tension adjuster that helps tune out buzz and also helps keep the guitar in tune"}
{"source": "Easy to put on the guitar"}
{"source": " Although the tension is good enough to press the strings down so they don't buzz, it is not so tough as to keep the fingers from compressing the string onto the fret"}
{"source": "Nice pick holder feature"}
{"source": "The micro adjuster is easy to adjust"}
{"source": " It turns smoothly and is kept in place by the spring"}
{"source": "Cons:None!This is the capo to get!"}
{"source": "The capo is pretty good"}
{"source": " I like the ability to customize tension"}
{"source": " However, it is unclear which way the capo should be put on - with the &#34;pincer&#34; side facing the floor, or facing the ceiling? In either direction, it's a bit awkward to put on/take off, as the angle of the pincer is difficult to get right quickly"}
{"source": " The Kaiser is still the best, IMO, but you can't adjust the tension on those"}
{"source": " Overall, this is good but not great"}
{"source": "Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is as near perfect a capo that I've ever come across"}
{"source": " I've been a Kyser Capo gal for many, many years but, this capo has that one beat by a mile"}
{"source": " There was absolutely new fret buzz no matter which of my guitars I tried it on or which fret I placed it on"}
{"source": " As I strummed each string to sound was so clear"}
{"source": " It's also very easy to open with one hand and keep it open, without any stress to your hand, until you release your grip to clamp it into place"}
{"source": "I do believe the folks at Planet Waves have developed the best capo ever! And the price ain't so bad either"}
{"source": "4"}
{"source": "6 starsMy main concern with adapters like this is sound quality"}
{"source": " The A/D is often weak, and there is sometimes too much latency for it to be useful for multi-tracking"}
{"source": " Apogee covers both areas well with this little puppy; the A/D is quite smooth, and it transfers the signal near perfectly"}
{"source": " And little it is, not much bigger than the jack"}
{"source": " If Bon Scott only knew"}
{"source": "But small though it may be, there's plenty of signal processing power in there, and while it doesn't stand up my best outboard gear, it offers very clean, clear sound transfers from guitar, bass, keys and line mics, so that you can do good-sounding entire tunes on your laptop with only the JAM as interface"}
{"source": " Which is yet another step forward in high-quality home recordings"}
{"source": " I like the thought that we're getting closer to folks releasing things entirely by themselves on their own sites, and not paying Crapple a huge chunk of profits for merely hosting a file"}
{"source": " Record companies and file hosts are increasingly anachronistic due to tech like this JAM, and maybe soon enough we'll see artists keeping ALL of the profits from their art"}
{"source": " Imagine that!This offers very close to studio quality, but keep in mind that even with 24-bit it is solid state"}
{"source": " Once you've used a good tube preamp you know what a difference in warmth in can make"}
{"source": " I ran this through one of mine and the A/B made it very obvious that old school studio gear still has its place"}
{"source": "Speaking of Crapple, the ads for this suggest that it is for iStuff only, which is not true"}
{"source": " I ran it on 7 Ultimate and it worked a charm, so don't be fooled by the typically proprietary ads, which Cook and co"}
{"source": " probably insist on: &#34;Don't mention anybody but us! Offer no alternatives! They must stay in our universe!&#34; Well, you needn't, this works with almost anything, so don't be fooled by the ad copy"}
{"source": "The only negative I can find is that it is a little chintzy in outer build, making one wonder how good the internals are, and how long they'll hold up"}
{"source": " A stronger, more solid sleeve would have been nice, especially at the price of 130"}
{"source": " But it does sound good, though as it may be used for portable purposes, you might want to wrap it for transport in a little hand towel or such to make sure shocks don't mess with it"}
{"source": " Take care of your recording equipment and it will take care of your music!"}
{"source": "I've been recording on my iMac, iPod Touch, iPad, and iPhone for some time, using Garage Band"}
{"source": " Interfacing with the iMac is easy, using various USB devices- I'm currently using a USB-equipped Alesis preamp"}
{"source": " iOS device interface is a bit more difficult; it is possible to use USB preamps, with an externally powered USB hub, but that starts getting very complicated and messy"}
{"source": "  I've been using simple devices like the 1K that  split the headphone/microphone jack into two separate cords, one for headphone, and one for guitar"}
{"source": " The problem with this sort of configuration is that it's very easy to overload the microphone input, and the recording quality done this way is not very good"}
{"source": " The Apogee JAM is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons"}
{"source": " First, it contains its own dedicated preamp and A/D, and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity"}
{"source": " Interface issues are non-existent; plugged into both the iPad and iPhone it was immediately recognized"}
{"source": " I didn't have any problems with either of the three supplied cables"}
{"source": "The JAM is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces, but on the whole I think it's worth it"}
{"source": " It's simple to use, has no detectable latency, and delivers excellent sound quality"}
{"source": " It does seem to draw a fair amount of current, and battery life  is shortened significantly when using this with an iPhone"}
{"source": " You'll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions"}
{"source": " With the iPad, this isn't as noticeable"}
{"source": " Even with that issue, I think the JAM is a good value"}
{"source": "  The various iOS devices are capable of making very high quality recordings, but only with quality input"}
{"source": " Given the cost of an new iPhone or iPad, the cost of the JAM is rather trivial in comparison"}
{"source": "This is the perfect fit for all my basses"}
{"source": " I have two Ibanez and two Essex basses"}
{"source": " They recommend the light top medium bottom string gauge"}
{"source": " I play fingerstyle and they feel great"}
{"source": " They have corrosion resistant packaging and since corrosion is what kills your strings the longer you can keep it at bay the better"}
{"source": " They are made in  the USA and they use recycled packaging"}
{"source": " I cannot attest to their lifespan but the package says long life so we will concede that point"}
{"source": "I put the set on my Squire Jazz Bass with threaded bridge rollers"}
{"source": " If you don't like loading up the tuners, trim a few inches off the leads; they're about 8-9 inches and have no cloth covering like Fenders"}
{"source": " I usually play medium gauge flatwounds on this bass and the FlexSteels have overall less tension"}
{"source": " I let out the truss rod a half turn to eliminate buzzing (yeah, ironic for a set designed for slapping)"}
{"source": "Gave them a good stretch and they're holding pitch well"}
{"source": " I find the windings on the FlexSteels more comfortable than Rotosounds - at least comparing new-to-new"}
{"source": " That helps when playing more horizontally with a lot of position shifting"}
{"source": "Overall I'm more into jazz and classic prog than slapping and there's plenty of 'piano low-end sproing' (Squire, Lake and Ray Bennett fans will feel right at home, fingers or pick)"}
{"source": " The set is so bright-sounding in fact I had to roll a considerable amount off"}
{"source": "The label says 'Light Top/Medium Bottom' (45-65-85-105): I found the gauge balance between the low E-A and the high D-G a little more pronounced than I'd like, but not outright uncomfortable"}
{"source": "I've been using D' Addario strings for 20+ years to great satisfaction"}
{"source": "  These flex steels are excellent"}
{"source": "  Bass tones, response and resonance are superior to my ear"}
{"source": "  You can't go wrong with these guys"}
{"source": "I play guitar and bass, but the gitpicker in me envies full-time bassists because they almost never break strings, and bass strings hold their tone far longer than guitar strings"}
{"source": " The price has also come down to where you can spend well under a hundred bucks a year on strings and always have fresh tone rich with harmonics"}
{"source": " You don't know how good you've got it! And these D'Ad's are very good all-round strings, though they make a lot more noise than flatwounds and even \"normal\" nickel wound, so they're not for sloppy fingers"}
{"source": "Very nice for funky players and those who want more definition and edge, these FlexSteels ring nicely and I like that the bottom E is a tad thicker at 105 than the usual light set's 100"}
{"source": " Because these are pretty bright, that extra oomph is nice"}
{"source": " And I'm a big believer that the amp can fix string issues much more easily with bass than guitar, so merely dialing out a little treble or even rolling off the volume a bit on your bass will take care of that"}
{"source": " But if you're popping and slapping, these come through loud and clear"}
{"source": " I really like the feel of the low E when I thumb pop with these"}
{"source": "I play a P-bass with my index, middle and thumb, and these punch nicely at that scale length"}
{"source": " The pickups also like them, and they get plenty loud, with full definition and plenty of top end, but not brittle"}
{"source": " With a Trace Elliot or other high-def amp, these would be very unforgiving for all but the most exact players"}
{"source": " I bet Marcus would kill with them"}
{"source": "I think these are perfect for funk, and excellent for almost all rock styles"}
{"source": " Obviously flats are better for jazz, but these make a good all-around string and for less than 20 clams they're a great deal"}
{"source": "I've been using D'Addario XL nickel wounds on my P-Bass for a long time"}
{"source": " They have a lot of tone, they seem to last a long time, and they're not very expensive"}
{"source": " These strings have the same feel as the nickel wounds, but are a lot brighter You get lots of overtones and high end from these"}
{"source": " The choice of gauges is a little different from the regular XLs, too; instead of the "}
{"source": "085 A and the "}
{"source": "100 E they have a "}
{"source": "085 A and a "}
{"source": "105 E"}
{"source": " That's just enough to give you a slightly more solid low end, and more metal to dig into, while retaining low tension in the D and G"}
{"source": " I'm more of an old-school player and prefer nickel for that mellower sound, but if you're into funk or more modern sounds, you may feel that the bright SS sound is for you, and if so, these are a great string"}
{"source": "I installed these on a Fender Jazz bass with active electronics"}
{"source": " After stringing them up & tuning I immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded"}
{"source": " I play finger style and they really added a clear definition to each note played"}
{"source": " They sounded great all up & down the fret board"}
{"source": " Where I really noticed the difference was in recording"}
{"source": " Been working on a new batch of songs and a the bass to the songs on the recordings made after these strings is noticeably superior to the ones made before"}
{"source": " Except for the songs with acoustic bass I will be going back and re recording the bass parts to the songs made before I installed these strings"}
{"source": " I  don't play slap or pick bass so I can't say how well they work for those styles but for my purpose they come very highly recommended"}
{"source": "I have to admit this up front - I'm a terrible bass player"}
{"source": " I play guitar and keep a bass in the music room for times when I have friend over to jam"}
{"source": " I do dabble with the bass, but I'm not proficient with it"}
{"source": " That being said; I really appreciate the difference these strings make in sound, playability and durability"}
{"source": " These strings sound better and feel great to play for long periods of time"}
{"source": " They have &#34;punch&#34; and &#34;snap&#34; which are good things to have in a bass"}
{"source": " I haven't had them on for a real long time, but in the time I've had them they remain consistent and show absolutely no sound or metal degradation in the time they've been on my Fender MIM Jazz bass"}
{"source": " When I need another set, I'll buy these!"}
{"source": "My daughter is learning how to play and the "}
{"source": "11 - "}
{"source": "48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain"}
{"source": "I put a set of the D'Addario NYXY0942 strings on my backup guitar and tuned it up"}
{"source": " Usually, I've had issues when bringing some brands of strings up to pitch, but the D'Addario's seemed to do a much better job"}
{"source": " I nearly always stress the higher pitch strings a bit before bringing them up to their final pitch and they stabilized quickly"}
{"source": " The wound strings also seem quite stable"}
{"source": " Frequently, it takes up to a couple of days for some strings to settle in, but I've seen no such issues with the D'Addario's"}
{"source": "I usually use thicker strings on my guitars to get a fatter tone, but I was impressed by the sound of these in spite of them being much thinner than I usually like"}
{"source": "My daughter is also very happy with them since they're not quite so tough on her fingers"}
{"source": "Put these on my G&L; S500 electric"}
{"source": " Sound great, play great, keeping their tune"}
{"source": " None broken yet, but I don't usually break strings"}
{"source": " I play at home for pleasure and recording, not out hitting the clubs"}
{"source": " Blues, blues slide, rock, metal"}
{"source": "I use D'Addario strings a lot"}
{"source": " I try others but always come back to them"}
{"source": " These will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on"}
{"source": " I really like them"}
{"source": "I usually don't use anything lighter than 10s because I think the tone starts to get thin on both the highs or the lows"}
{"source": "  I had already tried these in the 10 gauge size, and when these were offered via the Vine program, I thought what the heck"}
{"source": "  I have a guitar which I believe the tension is always high and tried these on that instrument"}
{"source": "  They do seem to help the string tension issue and the low end sounds (to these 62 year old ears) quite comparable to the 10s"}
{"source": "  However, I do think there is still a thinning of the high end, but that's subjective"}
{"source": "  I gave the 10s a 5 rating, and, realistically, I would give these 4"}
{"source": "5 id I could"}
{"source": "  If you're into 9 gauge strings I recommend these, but I'll stick with 10s and 11s"}
{"source": "I normally get Elixir strings, but these sounded too good to pass up"}
{"source": " They are indeed some high tech strings, with features including break resistance and improved tuning stability"}
{"source": " Plus they feel and sound good"}
{"source": " So grab a pack and get jamming"}
{"source": " You'll definitely want to check these out"}
{"source": "Great strings with a good feel to them"}
{"source": " They are size 10-46 which is just right for my electric guitars"}
{"source": " I won't know how long they last for awhile but they are a bit pricey"}
{"source": " If they hold up well then they are loud and bright on my telecaster and I will switch if they last a long time"}
{"source": " I don't think of these as extra lights (09-42) they are more of a light to me"}
{"source": "I am,  primarily, an acoustic guitar player who acquired my first electric just about a year ago, a Gibson Les Paul"}
{"source": " What I am finding is that the situation with electric guitar strings is very similar to that with acoustic guitars"}
{"source": " Most name-brand strings are just fine, but some are markedly different than others"}
{"source": " A few are actually a notch-above the others"}
{"source": " These NYXLs from D'Addario are definitely in that 'notch above' category"}
{"source": "I find them easier to play, better sounding and more reliable in holding their tuning than the six or seven others I have tried"}
{"source": " I plan to stick with them"}
{"source": "  A few comments about each area:Playability:These NYXLs bend easier and take less of a toll on the tips of my fretting (left) hand than do most of the others"}
{"source": " Of course I have callouses that have been developed over the years and feel permanent - but heavy playing can still make my fingertips sore"}
{"source": " These strings seem less 'cutting', even after a couple of hours of constant playing"}
{"source": " THey also 'squeak' less when I slide up and down the neck"}
{"source": "Sound:The sound is crisp and rich at the same time"}
{"source": " Most electric guitarists who I know tend to prefer one of these qualities over the other and choose their strings accordingly"}
{"source": " I prefer a blend of both - just as I do for my acoustic instruments"}
{"source": "  These NYXLs provide the closest blend that I have been able to achieve of these two different but complimentary characteristics, andTuning:Tuning and re-tuning can drive a guitar player to distraction"}
{"source": "  Even some really good sounding strings don't hold the tuning very well and even after only one brief riff, need to be adjusted by at least a quarter tone"}
{"source": " These NYXLs are holding the tuning FAR better than the others I have used"}
{"source": " Less time tuning = more good time playing!All-in-all, I found no flaw in these strings"}
{"source": " There is always something new coming along and D'Addario's formulation that uses high carbon steel alloy in the manufacture of these strings seems to make a considerable and positive difference"}
{"source": "  UNtil someone comes up with something better, I expect to stick with them!"}
{"source": "I've been using Ernie Balls cobalt slinky light gauge because I like the feel"}
{"source": "  I got these from the Vine, and wow, they are awesome"}
{"source": "  They cost no more than the strings I normally get, but the tone and feel is totally different"}
{"source": "  I can't comment on how long they'll last or keep in tune"}
{"source": "but for now, I'm impressed"}
{"source": "  I'll probably keep using these on my Santana PRS for awhile since I like the sound"}
{"source": "  Every once in awhile, I'll step outside of my box"}
{"source": "I mean"}
{"source": " I know the strings that I like and I tend to stick with them"}
{"source": "  I use d'addario on my acoustic guitars, and ernie balls on my electrics"}
{"source": "except for my strat"}
{"source": "I like fender bullets on it"}
{"source": "  So the sample from the Vine"}
{"source": "sorta of nudged me"}
{"source": "and I'm the better for it"}
{"source": "I have used D' Addario electric guitar strings for years and have always loved their feel, playability, tone and reliability"}
{"source": "  This set is no exception"}
{"source": "  Light gauge for those who like to shred a little more but still great tone"}
{"source": "  Highly recommend anything by D' Addario"}
{"source": "For a long time, I never thought much about guitar strings"}
{"source": " I pretty much thought they were all the same"}
{"source": "In fact, guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days"}
{"source": " D'Addario has gotten into the act with these NYXL strings, and I have to say that they are not like any other strings I've used"}
{"source": "The feel is different, and the sound is different"}
{"source": " Different in a WOW way"}
{"source": " Yeah, they're more expensive, but they're worth it"}
{"source": " I'm a cheapskate, and I can't go back to cheap strings"}
{"source": "Now I'm spoiled, and I've become a guitar strings snob"}
{"source": "D'Addario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around"}
{"source": " I've used their strings for electric & acoustic bass, electric and acoustic guitar, Irish bazouki, mandolin, Irish tenor banjo, 5 string banjo & even used their octave mandolin strings on my Serbian brach always with stellar results"}
{"source": " When they said these were deluxe premium strings I knew it wouldn't be hype"}
{"source": " I was right"}
{"source": " I strung my guitar with these about 3 weeks ago & have probably played the guitar 25 or so hours at gigs and in the studio"}
{"source": " I've never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of 3- 45 minute sets but these did"}
{"source": " And I was sober so it wasn't just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune"}
{"source": " Not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when I played it"}
{"source": " Of course that wouldn't mean a thing if they didn't feel good on the fingers"}
{"source": " They do"}
{"source": " Like they were custom made for your guitar"}
{"source": " They were on my Rickenbacker so I can't honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but I strongly suspect they would"}
{"source": " Not only do they stay in tune but 3 weeks later they still sound crisp & new"}
{"source": " I'm going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good"}
{"source": "  I usually change my strings every other week when I'm playing regularly so I'm already passed my regular limit"}
{"source": " I may update this review in a month or so when I know how long they lasted"}
{"source": " Most highly recommended!"}
{"source": "I usually use Gibson Vintage Nickle Strings on my electric guitars but when I had an opportunity to try theses strings out I jumped at the chance"}
{"source": " I put them on a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop guitar with P-90 pickups"}
{"source": " I had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed"}
{"source": " They had some great &#34;spank&#34; and sounded great"}
{"source": " Easy to play (they almost seemed thinner than advertised - they play like 9's but sounded like tens)"}
{"source": " I am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the Gibson strings"}
{"source": " Next I want to try a set on a Strat and see how they sound - I suspect they will sound and play great!"}
{"source": "Don't get me wrong, the improvement over the old formulation is noticeable"}
{"source": " There's a little more &#34;brightness&#34; to the output, they are a little more long-lasting, and they stay in tune quicker and longer than the normal XL120"}
{"source": " This is a good string"}
{"source": "But it looks like the going rate on these strings will be 12 bucks a set"}
{"source": " I can get three sets of regular (excellent) XL120 strings for that money, and if the NYXL lasted 3 times as long then they'd be worthwhile, but I've been able to try them twice now, and they don't last 3 times as long"}
{"source": "Great string, great innovation, great achievement, drastically overpriced"}
{"source": "D'Addario's NYXL1046 Nickel Plated Electric Guitar Strings, I have the Light, are THE best! I've got them on my Fender Strat"}
{"source": " I can tune my guitar and play it for a couple hours and still not have it go out of tune"}
{"source": " Even if I'm using the tremolo bar and bending strings these things stay in tune"}
{"source": " When I get together with other guitar players to jam I don't have to worry about being the one who has to keep tuning my guitar"}
{"source": " A couple Ernie Ball die hards are about ready to jump ship and get on the D'Addario Line after seeing mine in action"}
{"source": "I can put my Strat aside, pick it up to play a few days later and it's still in tune"}
{"source": " Doesn't happen when I pick up my other electric that don't have these strings on it yet"}
{"source": " Either I'm going to have to put these on my other electric or the Fender is going to be my baby who gets all the play time with Mama"}
{"source": "I've never used strings that bend so well"}
{"source": " And they don't cut into my fingers as much when playing for extended periods of time"}
{"source": " These are miracle strings in my mind"}
{"source": "Most importantly, they sound GREAT!Good going D'Addario!"}
{"source": "I was looking forward to trying these, as I've loved this company's product since day one"}
{"source": "But I think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;HD&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price"}
{"source": " More profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon"}
{"source": "I have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened"}
{"source": " The bottom dropped out, the top end stopped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when I strum with a pick"}
{"source": "When I play with fingers it's better, but not worth spending more money on than the normal "}
{"source": "012s I've been using (which I think I liked a lot better)"}
{"source": "It's possible that these work great on the Taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but I'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these"}
{"source": "Again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;HD&#34; moniker"}
{"source": " no thanks"}
